<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>297 wedding guests. It’s a minor miracle. Our final total is below 300.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>There. I am done. 500 autographed copies of Wild Storm. My pre-wedding signing obligations are finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. Now sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Final payment for the rooftop venue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean, the perfect venue. A 360 degree view of Manhattan, the stars above us, the world at our feet. It’s too bad Beckett didn’t want to bungee jump off the side of the building for our big exit. Now that would have been cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The tuxes will be in tomorrow evening. Did you tell Esposito and Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did. They’ll be here to try them on and to collect them.  You are the most adorable best man a groom could hope for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, probably the concierge with more gifts.  Ah, hi, Gerard. Put them over there with the others. Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>‘Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, don’t forget the forms for the marriage license!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Those are my case files. Ask your questions, because I will be pretty much unreachable for the next three weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, what are you more excited about, the wedding or the honeymoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Three weeks in the Maldives on a private island? What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, the only thing I’m not excited about is having to say my vows in front of all those people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, you’ll be fine. Just imagine your wedding guests are murder suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>In their underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>You know, I was so nervous before my wedding that I ran into a wall and got a black eye. You’re supposed to be a wreck. You’re about to experience one of the most important days of your life.  I’m so happy for you, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>In spite of who you’re marrying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … who’s ready to get her marriage license?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Me! Almost. I’ve gotta get my bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excellent.  And Alexis wanted me to remind you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She called, she texted, and she emailed. We will be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And we’ll bring our black shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have our paperwork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I do.  I’m just practicing. I –  – I do. I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Have fun, guys.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>T-minus 72 hours until we are married. This feels like a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because I’m dreamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, shush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  Here you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>Mr. Richard Castle and Miss Katherine Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>Proof of divorce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is – is there something wrong with my documents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>They’re in order.  Miss Beckett, do you have yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pardon me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>Your divorce paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m sorry, there’s a mistake. I’ve never been married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CLERK</speaker><content>Well, according to this, you have. And it looks like you still are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To whom?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Rogan O’Leary? Well, who is Rogan O’Leary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A guy she met freshman year at Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I think I’m going to be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And you married him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except she did. The two of them drove to Vegas, had too much to drink, and thought it would be a riot to take a cab to a drive-through wedding chapel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> You didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I did, but I never thought that it was for real! And I broke up with the guy a couple weeks later after I found out he was a compulsive liar, degenerate, and a thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but not before you tied the knot.  And here I thought you were a one and done kind of girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Does your father know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I really am going to be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that’ll be my lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>HENRY BROWNING</speaker><content>You were both over 18. Regardless of your seriousness or intent at the time, I’m afraid your wedding at the Drive Through of Love was real, legal, and binding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we –  – are getting married in three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BROWNING</speaker><content>I’m afraid you can’t. Not unless you terminate your first marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have 300 people coming, most of them are flying in. So what are we going to say to all of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Henry, is there anything we can do to make this go away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BROWNING</speaker><content>It’s possible. If there’s mutual consent. I brought a dissolution of marriage contract and I could expedite it through the city, but … you’ll have to get Mr. O’Leary to sign it, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How? It’s been fifteen years. I have no idea where he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, it looks like we’ve found him, but man, is your husband a piece of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except legally he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, what do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, your boy got around. He was charged with theft in Austin in ’05, he did time for a DUI in ’07.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He was arrested for fraud in Kentucky and oh, this is a good one, he was put in jail for impersonating an FBI agent in New Orleans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I must say, given his record, I’m really surprised you stayed with him all these years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know where he is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. It looks like he settled in a small town in upstate New York called Willow Creek about five years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have his contact information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Texting right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>OPERATOR</speaker><content>The voicemail for -  Rogan O’Leary – is full. Please try again later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not getting through. Either the phone rings incessantly or I get the "voicemail’s full" message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I want to get married. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want to get married, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay! Then it’s settled. You’ll stay here and keep the wedding on track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to go to Willow Creek. I’ve got less than three days to find Rogan O’Leary and get a divorce.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>NEIGHBOR</speaker><content>He’s not worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pardon me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>NEIGHBOR</speaker><content>Sweetie, I’ve been his neighbor for five years. He’s got a smile that will make your pants fall off. But trust me, he’s trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know where I can find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>NEIGHBOR</speaker><content>Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Hi. I’m looking for one of your bartenders. Rogan O’Leary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Give me a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>TILDY MCGUIRE</speaker><content>You want a break? I’ll give you a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>What did you do? How about what you didn’t do!  I thought you came here to apologize! To tell me how sorry you are. But no. All you want is your stuff back? It’s not even your stuff!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>It’s our stuff. And – and I need it to make things right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>I’m through. Now get out of my bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Come on, babe. You know you don’t mean that. You love me too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>How’s that for love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Kit-Kat?  Is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello, Rogan.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … I see you haven’t changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Oh, what? That? Nah. Come on. That was just a – ah – a lover’s quarrel, as they say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>So, Kit-Kat, what brings you to Willow Creek, huh? You walking the nostalgia trail, tracking down old flames to discover who you really are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah … no. Do you remember a trip that we took to Vegas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Ah … I don’t know. It’s a little fuzzy. But most of my best memories are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So when we were there do you recall a cab ride and a drive up chapel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Nope, but I do recall a dine and dash on the Strip. Huh? Do you remember that, with the hoagies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, well, you know, you’re probably going to find this funny, but as it turns out … you and I have been married for fifteen years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>For realsies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>That is hilarious. How long have you known that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well … I just found out. But you know what? It’s not a big deal because all you have to do is –  – sign this and you’re off the hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it’s a – it is a pretty nice hook, you know?  I mean heck, we have been married this long. Maybe we should just give it a chance.  No, I know, I know. So uh … it must be pretty important to you to have me sign these forms, then huh? You know, if you’ve driven all the way from –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>New York. Let me guess. Lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Detective!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Wow! So tell me, how does a girl go from picking the lock on Pearl Jam’s tour bus so she can steal Eddie Vedder’s jean jacket to becoming a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … you know, I’m sorry. You’re obviously busy and I should probably just go, but if you could just sign this –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>No, yeah. Of course. Look, yeah. I would – I would really love to sign this dissolution of marriage agreement for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>But – you’re going to have to do something for me, first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The easy one.  Which is this one.  Thank you.  Any news from Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … she texted me a couple of hours ago. She said she found him, but I haven’t heard from her since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe they’re catching up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure. No, sure. They’ve got a lot in common. She can talk about all the people she’s put in prison, and he can talk about all the people he’s met in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um … Alexis? I haven’t gained this much daddy weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That can’t be right. I double checked the size ten times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, maybe you finally hit that growth spurt you’ve been waiting on, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  And that’s her.  Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so, there has been a little glitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He won’t sign?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no, he’ll sign. But he wants me to do something first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wants me to break into his ex-girlfriend’s truck and steal a garage door opener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay … why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Apparently after they broke up his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things and he wants them back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he needs the garage door opener to get into her place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her mom’s place, but yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, given his record why doesn’t he just steal it himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar. And he can’t get close to it without someone spotting it and then telling her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> And you’re actually thinking about doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If I don’t he won’t sign. Castle, he could drag this on for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if you get caught?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I won’t. Look, Castle, he’s got me over a barrel here. If I don’t do this we don’t get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just get this over with and come home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll call you when I’m done.</content></utterance>
</scene>



<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mission accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you got the remote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. And I wasn’t caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you’re sure he’ll sign the papers now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, he’s going to sign them, all right. I’m not taking no for an answer. Tell everyone that this wedding is on. I’ll be on my way back to the city soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can’t wait.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>DEPUTY</speaker><content>Did you get the license of the truck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It didn’t have one. But both of the men were wearing masks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>DEPUTY</speaker><content>And your friend that got taken, what’s his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rogan. Rogan O’Leary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? Why are you closing your notebook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>DEPUTY</speaker><content>Ma’am, the department doesn’t have the resources to investigate every claim involving Mr. O’Leary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But someone took him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>DEPUTY</speaker><content>I’m sure they did. I’m sure they had a very good reason. And in a few days he’ll show up drunk, bruised, and sorry as hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t have a few days. I need to find him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>DEPUTY</speaker><content>Ma’am, from one woman to another … let him go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s been abducted? How – how? But you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know. I don’t believe it either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, okay, I hate to ask, but do you think maybe we should postpone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. I’m not giving up. I’m going to find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m a detective. Someone here has to know something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You shouldn’t be doing this alone. I’m coming up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, absolutely. Everything here is completely under control. I will see you in a few hours.  ‘bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?  Yes, this is Richard Castle.  What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We lost our venue? How’s that even possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They had a circus party there tonight with some first time fire breathers and now our rooftop venue does not have a floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This is a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have no place to get married and no one to get married to. I think disaster is an understatement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So called disaster is merely opportunity in disguise. We’ll just find another place to hold the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Where are we going to find a venue in Manhattan that holds 300 people? In less than two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh! We already have one.  Not in Manhattan. We can move the whole party to our house in the Hamptons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Yes! We’ve held larger parties than this out there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Brilliant. I will call the housekeeper first thing in the morning and have them start getting the place ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You really think we can pull this off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, please. I once staged A Chorus Line on a subway platform when our company lost its space. I think I can move a wedding. Alexis will help with everything. You just make sure Katherine finds that deadbeat husband of hers.  Yes!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks for coming up, babe. I’m so sorry about this whole mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, what’s a fiancé for if not to help find his future wife’s current husband?  And Alexis and Mother will get far more done without my interference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just hope that all their work is not for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think Rogan’s ex will be able to help us find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They lived together. If we’re lucky she’ll be able to tell us what kind of mess he was mixed up in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CLORIS MAGUIRE</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh .. hi, ma’am.  NYPD. We’re looking for Rogan O’Leary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CLORIS</speaker><content>Well if you find him you can keep him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Stop it, mama.  You were in the bar yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I was hoping that Mr. O’Leary could help us with … an old case, but it seems that he was abducted last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content> By who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We were hoping you could tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CLORIS</speaker><content>Wasn’t me. I’d’ve offed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Mama, that’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, he was taken by two men in a rusty pickup truck. Do you have any idea who they were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>No. But he’s always working crazy angles, pissing people off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that why you left him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>No. I was used to that. But he took money from me for one of his schemes. Said he was going to make us rich. He lost it all, of course. And now I might lose the bar. The thing is, in spite of it all … I love him. I mean, I can overlook the fact that he’s not a regular job kind of guy or that he can’t marry me while his wife’s in a coma –  – but he should have never put my bar in jeopardy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, he said that he had a wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A wife in a coma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Yeah. He married in college, she got in an accident. Been in a coma fifteen years.  Katie … something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>It’s kind of tragic, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So very tragic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So um … did he mention any trouble yesterday? Or say anything about you having something in your possession that he urgently needed? Something in the garage or house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Actually, yeah. He said he needed the laptop I took from his apartment. Said he needed it right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he say why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>No, but since it’s my laptop I figured it was a line of bull. That he wanted me to give it up so that he could sell it for the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Given how anxious he was to get his hands on it it might have something to do with his abduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tildy, could we borrow that laptop?  It might help us find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We are trained professionals. And Rogan might be in some very, very serious trouble.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s in trouble all right. I mean, all these years he knew that we were married. He knew when I got here. And for fifteen years he’s been using that as an excuse not to commit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Coma wife.  It’s kind of brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean despicable, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you find anything on the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Their emails to each other are fairly pornographic but nothing that would get a man abducted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Maybe we should call Tory and have her access it remotely and see if we’re missing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we should recheck Rogan’s apartment, see if there’s anything there that can tell us what he was involved with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve gotta call Lanie. I’m not going to make my spa bachelorette party this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were going to have naked ladies at your party, too?  Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Do what you need to need to do, girl. Operation Hamptons is in full swing. And we’ll have a newlyweds spa day when you get back from your honeymoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Lanie, look, I don’t know when we’re going to get back, so can you go to my place, pick up the dress, and take it up with you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It will be there waiting for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks, Lane.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Assuming we get there at all.  Are we crazy for going ahead with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. But what other choice do we have? Look, I don’t want to have a makeup wedding in a few months. I want to do this now. So let’s find this husband of yours and get married tomorrow. Besides, it’s not like things can get any crazier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Well … what do we have here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I spoke too soon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Where’s Rogan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, let’s just relax and put down the guns so no one gets hurt –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>See, the only ones getting hurt are going to be you if you don’t tell me where Rogan’s at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don’t know where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We barely know who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Then what are you doing in his place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looking for him, same as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>What’s this?  Is that you?  That’s a yes. Okay, well according to this, you and Rogan are married. Thought you didn’t know the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, well, funny story there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Is it still going to be funny when I make you bleed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Your husband owes me a lot of money. Now where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>All right. Seeing as how you’re his wife, you can pay me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah … exactly how much does he owe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Less his down payment, $5,000 for services rendered, payable today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of services?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>That’s between me and him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you want me to pay you then tell me what I’m paying for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>All right, well, that seems fair. Your husband hired us to steal a phone last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whose phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Uh, some girl named Sapphire. Some stripper down at the Roadhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>$5,000 dollars for a stripper’s phone? What was on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>I don’t know. Didn’t ask. Don’t care. I just want my money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And we’ll get it to you. We just need find Rogan first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>No, Mrs. O’Leary. I want my money now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … Castle, you wouldn’t happen –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, well, my mother took most of my cash and Alexis has my ATM card.  I don’t suppose you’d take a check? That’s –  - no. I’ve got – I have $500 right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just for more time. We’ll – owe you the rest of the $5 grand. We just need a little bit more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-32"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>You bought yourself twelve hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-33"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>You don’t have the full amount when I come back, I start breaking legs.  Do you understand?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Mrs. O’Leary, I’m not okay. I happen to like my legs. And yours too. And why is your husband paying bikers over $5 grand for a stripper’s phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>First of all, could we please stop calling him my husband? And secondly, I don’t know. But I’m guessing it has something to do with the abduction.  Hey, it’s Beckett. Yeah, I need you guys to set up remote access to scrub a laptop.  Castle, can you look up the address to the Roadhouse? I want to know what was on that stripper’s phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Find a local strip bar? Now that I know how to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>SAPPHIRE</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about. No one stole my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>SAPPHIRE</speaker><content>Yeah.  It’s right here. See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there anything on it that anyone might want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>SAPPHIRE</speaker><content>It’s just a phone. What is this all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know a guy named Rogan O’Leary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>SAPPHIRE</speaker><content>Can’t help you. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, Sapphire. Please. He might be in real trouble, so if you know something that can help us find him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>SAPPHIRE</speaker><content>Look, if you don’t want a dance then I need to move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She knows something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, whatever it is she doesn’t want to tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I don’t have the jurisdiction to make her.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Kate, it’s – it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie? What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I … went to your apartment to pick up your dress and …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Kate, a pipe burst in the apartment above and …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no. No, don’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I tried. I tried, sweetie. I did everything that I could. But there was just too much damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Kate … the dress. It’s gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s only a dress. It’s not the end of the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why does it feel like it is? Our wedding was supposed to be magical. It was supposed to be our perfect day and now it’s just …  … falling apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’ll put it back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m married to someone else. And I have no idea where he is, we don’t have any leads, and then to make things worse the venue and now this? I mean, it just feels like all of this is one big sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe it is a sign.  A sign that ours is a great love story. Because what’s a great love story without obstacles to overcome? Every fairytale has them. Terrible trials that only the worthy can transcend. But you can’t give up. That’s the deal. We want the happy ending, we can’t give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that’s why I want to marry you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Tory. I think I may have found something. I was scrubbing the laptop and I came across a hidden folder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Pictures. According to image data, they were recently downloaded from someone’s phone. Most of them are innocuous but there are a couple of them that are, um … I think you need to see. I’m emailing them now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I know why your scheming, scamming husband wanted to steal that stripper’s phone.  Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s a guy with a stripper. What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the big deal?  That is the big deal. It’s the local pastor. There’s only one reason your husband would pay that much to get these photos. He was blackmailing a man of God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A pastor with skin in the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And motive to make Rogan disappear.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for meeting with us, Pastor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>Well, you said on the phone it was urgent, and helping people is my calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does that include helping people out of their clothes while they’re sitting on your lap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content> Where did you get those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you already know the answer to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content> I suppose you want money, too. I am a pastor, not a bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re not here to blackmail you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content> You’re not?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>It started six months ago. I had … a moment of weakness. That stripper got photos of me. It’s been a nightmare ever since. $500 here, $1,000 there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Sapphire was blackmailing you, not Rogan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>At first. Then Rogan must have found out. He got his hands on the photos somehow. He said if I gave him $25,000 he would make them disappear forever. And if I didn’t … he would release them to the Willow Creek Register.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s why you kidnapped him? To get those photos back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>What? No, I didn’t kidnap him. What kind of a man do you think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I think we’ve got a pretty good picture. We have a few pictures, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>I was going to pay him! I swear. Look.  I was supposed to meet him here this morning with the money. He was going to hand over the laptop and the photos. But he never showed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content>Be right with you, Mrs. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you have no idea where Rogan is or who might have taken him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>PASTOR BOB</speaker><content> No. But if you find him tell him I am ready to pay.  I just want this to end.  Thank you for waiting, Mrs. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So your husband is hijacking someone else’s blackmail. It’s kind of ingenious in a degenerate sort of way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if you’re Sapphire. If you’re Sapphire you’re pissed that you lost your income stream and you want those photos back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CRYSTAL</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but Sapphire’s gone. She bolted right after she talked to you guys. B*tch stuck me with her shift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know where we could find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CRYSTAL</speaker><content>Uh, you could try her boyfriend’s place. They sort of live together. His name’s Jimmy Lutz. He’s got a farm off Route 183.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You really should tip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the truck. The one that took Rogan. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Check out the barn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like we found our kidnappers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then we should call the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And tell them what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That they have guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>On their own property. Which is their constitutional right. We don’t have proof that they have Rogan.  Yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yet? What do you mean, yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. Let’s see if that’s where they’re keeping them.  Do you want to get married tomorrow or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if we get caught?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll tell them we’re tourists from the city. We got lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. That worked out really well in Deliverance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s start with that barn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This place looks like the start of an Amish horror film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.  Rogan? Is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was not expecting that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rogan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Oh my God. Dude, you should have heard yourself.  Oh! Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Kit-Kat, who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kit-Kat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This guy is Richard Castle. My future husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Really? Well, after his little scream you may want to uh … recheck his man parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My man parts are just fine, thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could everyone please stop saying man parts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>So how did you find me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we just followed the trail of disappointment and deception. Led us right to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content> Oh, wow. You’re engaged to a douche.  Here, why don’t you untie me so we can get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You’re a douche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>What – what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Freeing up one hand. That’s all I need to sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Good one, Kit-Kat. That’s hilarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not joking. If you want me to cut you loose, then sign the papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>I’ll sign the papers when we’re out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sign them. Now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>What, you don’t trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Don’t you want to hear my side of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t care about your side! I just want you to sign these papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, maybe we should wait to do this until we get somewhere safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-29"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yes! Listen to Man Parts. Let’s get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you can disappear again? Or get kidnapped? No. Sign these papers. Right now. On the dotted line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-31"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Whoa, you don’t understand! Those guys are going to kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Over blackmail photos? They’re not going to kill you, Rogan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Though if you think about it, that would solve our problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-34"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Listen, this isn’t about the pastor, okay? There were - there were other photos on that – that stripper’s phone. Photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jimmy Lutz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-36"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but I don’t think that’s his real name. I mean, the ugly brothers, they always called him something else. Like … Barbozza something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, Barbozza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-38"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean like Mickey Barbozza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-40"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, that’s it! I mean, this guy wants those pictures something fierce, but I wouldn’t tell him where they were because I didn’t want him going after Tildy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I’m sorry. Are we talking about Mickey Barbozza, the mob hitman who disappeared about a decade ago –  – oh, yes, yeah, that’s the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, help me untie him. We’ve gotta get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-43"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So how bad is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He eluded a massive manhunt by killing half a dozen people, and the FBI’s been looking for him ever since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-45"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>And so, what? He’s been hiding out up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep. Congratulations, Rogan. You accidentally stole photos of a fugitive mobster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-47"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Okay, that was not my intent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, come on. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-49"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Is it just me or are we completely screwed?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Come on, Richard. Pick up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Still no word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No. Not for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s beautiful, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s perfect. I can’t believe Alexis and Martha pulled this off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now all we need is a bride and groom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The wedding’s less than 24 hours away. I hope they make it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell me this is still part of the fairy tale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If it is, it’s a Grimm one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>What do – what do you think they’re going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My guess? Once they recover the photos they’ll probably kill us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Thus making this the worst bachelor party ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Don’t look at me. Okay? We would have been out of there if she hadn’t gotten all stubborn and just cut me loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You could have just signed those papers and cut me loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Hey, believe it or not, I was just trying to do the right thing for Tildy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By blackmailing a pastor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Please. Don’t let the collar fool you. That guy had it coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Really? The pastor had it coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yes! He told me about this investment opportunity where I could double my money. Only … I didn’t have any money, so I borrowed Tildy’s. Well, guess what? It was a scam. The guy was rooking me to pay off the stripper. I mean, how many broken commandments is that? So I took matters into my own hands, you know? And it was a damn fine plan, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Except the murderous mobster part. I really didn’t see that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This isn’t over. We’re going to get out of this. There’s a way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Love to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>MICKEY BARBOSSA</speaker><content>So. The thief has a wife. That’s good. That makes this all a lot easier.  Where are those photos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>I told you, I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Well guess what? I can incentivize you.  Where are the photos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Okay, look. I – I deleted them. They’re gone. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>I don’t believe you. I’m going to count to three. You don’t tell me where they are, you’re not going to need these court papers. I’ll end your marriage for you. One …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Two …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know! I know where they are.  I know where they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re on a laptop. At his place.  She and I can take you to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>All right. Why don’t we all go?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>So why are they taking all of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why do you think? Husband, wife, future husband, your apartment? They find our dead bodies, the story of jealous rage writes itself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mickey, trust me. You don’t want to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Trust me. I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Okay. Where’s the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>No, where’s my money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>What the hell is going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want your money? It’s right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is Mickey Barbozza. He’s wanted by the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So there’s a reward for his capture. A hundred thousand dollars. You take him in, it’s all yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>HEAD BIKER</speaker><content>Let’s go, tough guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>That was a hell of an angle you guys played. I guess, uh, I should be thanking you both for saving my ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t forget the contribution to the homicidal bikers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. So um … maybe you could sign the papers now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>You know, Kit-Kat, I don’t want you to be sad about this, okay? Because you’re better off without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just sign the papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>You are a lucky man, Man Parts. I … uh, I just wish I had what you guys have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe you already do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>With Tildy? I don’t know. I mean, I screwed that up, you know? After all this, I didn’t even get her money back, and she’s going to lose the bar because of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not necessarily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>From Pastor Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A $25,000 apology for scamming that money from you. He says if he never sees you or those photos again, you’re even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Rogan? What the hell? I told you, I never wanted to see you in here again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Tildy, Tildy. Wait. Just … I got some bad news. My wife? That was in a coma? She died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t be. She’s in a much better place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>ROGAN</speaker><content>She – she left me some money and I just … I want to give it to you.  God, I love you, Tildy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-27"><speaker>TILDY</speaker><content>Oh … come with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t believe you gave him the money from Pastor Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m a sucker for happy endings. Let’s get the hell out of this town and go get our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. We’re getting married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-31"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>People are starting to arrive. Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Almost!  How did you pull this off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-33"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, you know. I called your dad and he said you had a dress you could wear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-34"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Wow. You look like an angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, just stop, Lanie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-38"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I must say, your mother had great taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-39"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yes, she did.  Look at you. I believe you are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-41"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Lanie, darling, could you just give us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-42"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, sure.  I’ll just tell your dad that it’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks, Lanie. Martha, I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am to you and Alexis for … for putting this all together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-44"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And I want to thank you, for making my son so very happy.  I brought you something. In case you didn’t have something blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, wow. They’re … beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-46"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>They were given to me by my mother to wear on my wedding day and by her mother before. Only women of substance have worn these gems. They’ve been waiting, Katherine. For you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m so honored, Martha, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-48"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh darling, they’re exquisite on you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-50"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I will leave you to talk to your groom. I’ll be outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-51"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, lover. How close are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-52"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Twenty minutes. And you’ll be happy to know things went smoothly with the judge. You are a free woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-53"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But not for long. I’ve got our marriage license in my pocket and I will be there soon. And Kate?</content></utterance>
