<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content> To Farrah, may the greatest mysteries of your life lie ahead. Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>FARRAH DARWAZA</speaker><content>Thank you so much.  You know, our pilot is also a huge fan. You think you could sign a book for her, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d love to. All I ask in return is that she deliver us to Heathrow safely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Hey! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Um, enjoy your stay in London, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>I got bumped out of my assigned seat. You said you’d fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>I said you had my apology. This is the only seat available in first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Do you know who I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know who he is but I know what he is. A giant ass – whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, when did you become such a nervous flyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not. I just don’t like turbulence. Or a sudden drop in cabin pressure. Or mechanical problems. Or crashing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>There’s nothing to worry about. It’s just a little bumpy air, that’s all it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Air, by nature, should not be bumpy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Just look at the flight crew. If they’re up and smiling then everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, they’re up but they are not exactly smiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, it’s a long flight. You should really focus on something else or it’ll seem even longer.  For both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. I shall ignore the grim specter of death and focus on our itinerary.  All right. A car is going to pick us up from the hotel, whisk us off to the Sherlock Holmes Society, where I will speak to my fellow mystery writers about –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Actually, I made plans for tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wh – what plans? With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, some friends who are doing their semester abroad in London. We’re meeting at a pub in South Kent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But the um – the Sherlock Holmes Society is convening at 221B Baker Street. You don’t want to miss the actual home of Sherlock Holmes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You do know he’s fictional, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but his address is real.  And I will be speaking and if you are not there who will be proud of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m always proud of you, Dad. But I’ve heard you speak a million times. I know what you’re going to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is improbable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’ll say you don’t believe in writer’s block. That you wrote your first novel to impress a girl. That reading great writers inspires you and drinking with them inspires you to beat them on the best seller list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Clearly I need to develop some new material. But this was supposed to be old-fashioned father/daughter time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, watching you speak to your cronies isn’t exactly father/daughter time. Besides, I’m not twelve. We don’t have to be attached at the hip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. That impending specter of death? It’s back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  Beckett! How did you get in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Through the magic of Wi-Fi. I figured you’d be online. So I thought that you would want an update. We solved the case. The racecar driver did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. That’s good to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is everything okay up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Just a little turbulence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Everything’s going to be just fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?  Is it just me or does everything not seem just fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett, relax. Even the most heinous turbulence won’t bring a plane down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>And every day twenty flights leave New York and land in London without a problem. It’s going to be the same for Castle’s flight, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s going to be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Folks, this is Captain Edmunds. We hit some chop there, but we’ve climbed to 39,000 feet and expect a smooth ride all the way to Heathrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>See? There’s nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why aren’t they smiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, you heard the pilot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m telling you, something is not right.  And I’m going to find out what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>JIM KOGUT</speaker><content>Sir, the seatbelt sign is still illuminated. If you could please return to your seat –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re not smiling. None of you are smiling, and the Captain’s here? What’s going on? Is there some sort of mechanical problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Please, sir, just return –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Jim, wait.  Maybe he can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I’m Captain Edmunds. You work with the NYPD, right? We could actually use your assistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My assistance with what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>This is Kyle Ford. He’s the air marshal on this flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw this guy. He’s sitting in my row. He –  – at least, he was sitting in my row. What does this have to do with the air marshal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>An hour ago he sent a text to his field office about a security issue on board this aircraft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of security issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content> “Possible threat to Oceanic Air Flight 57. I’m investigating.” That’s all Ford said in his text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what did he tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Unfortunately I haven’t been able to talk to him. Mr. Ford is missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Missing? How could he be missing? Did you search the plane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>DEBBIE PARKER</speaker><content>From front to back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Given the circumstances, I’ve been instructed to lock myself in the cockpit and continue on to Heathrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Terrorism protocol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Precisely. Right now, with the air marshal unaccounted for, you’re the closest thing we have to law enforcement on this plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which in itself is cause for concern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>CAPTAIN EDMUNDS</speaker><content>Will you help us, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yes. No, of course. Of course. Okay, um … when you searched the plane where did you look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Um, the restrooms, the galleys –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>The cargo hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Even the overhead bins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Well, Mr. Ford is on the plane somewhere. We just have to search again. Maybe skip the overhead bins this time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s like he just disappeared. It doesn’t make sense.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How well do you know the air marshal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Not that well. Mr. Ford flies with us, like, twice a month. He’s very professional, very polite.  There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Okay. This is the only other place we haven’t given a second look.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does Ford know how to get down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Of course. He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It runs the length of the plane. And you looked everywhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t pull out all the luggage because there was no sign anyone was down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a snake on the motherflying plane!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>You’re lucky it wasn’t the pit bulls we had to ship last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at this luggage. Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>They don’t. Not usually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s three different bags from three different passengers. That doesn’t make any sense. Unless …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Unless what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless someone took the clothes out of another suitcase and stuffed them into those three bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>You don’t think …?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One way to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Oh my God. That’s Air Marshal Ford.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’ve got to be kidding me. The air marshal is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not just dead. But bumped on the head, murdered. And there’s more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kyle Ford’s holster is empty. His gun is missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so we have to assume that the killer is armed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And they may have another agenda: taking hostages, hijacking the plane. FYI – this is not the relaxing London getaway I had planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So who else knows about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, just the flight crew, the air marshal service, and the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, they gave me a copy of the flight manifest. I emailed it to you. You should have it by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. I’ll coordinate with the FBI and start running names to look for red flags.  Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis is on this flight. Along with almost two hundred other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do what? What am I supposed to do? Catch the killer? It could be anyone. I wouldn’t know where to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You start at the beginning. We build a timeline for our victim, same first step we always take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Right. Just, this time the first step is 39,000 feet off the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m going to be here with you. I’ll working this case from the ground, along with the boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you. I can figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I am sorry, miss. This area is off limits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, she’s – that’s – she’s with me. That’s my daughter. She’s – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You were gone so long I got worried. Why are you down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh, I’ll call you later. I love you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>- always rooting for that coyote, not that roadrunner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys? I need your help.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who do you think could have done it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that’s what I’m going to try and figure out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By reconstructing Ford’s movements with the flight crew. In the meantime I need you to keep this to yourself and go back upstairs where it’s safer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How is it safer? Isn’t that where the killer is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – look, I just don’t want you to be a part of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m already a part of it. I can help, Dad. I interned with Lanie, remember? I’ll check the body for clues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well – Alexis –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>There’s a killer on this plane. We don’t know what he’s planning or who he is. And maybe I can do something about that.  I am not going back to my seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even if it means us being joined at the hip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Really? You’re throwing that back at me now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right in your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I’ll get started here. You go talk to the flight crew and try to figure out who did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>It was someone out there. One of those people killed Kyle Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>I just told the other flight attendants. I still can’t believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>What do we do now, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, now we try to piece together where the victim was and who he had contact with before he died. When was the last time anyone remembers seeing Air Marshal Ford?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Wait. Who served him during drink service?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, this was an 8:30AM flight. Drink service occurred when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Uh, we start at 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>And by the time I did the trash pickup Ford wasn’t in his seat. He was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Not gone. I noticed him during meal service near the back of the plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>I didn’t see because a passenger got in my face about the lousy food. We recently changed vendors to save money –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  – when you saw him was he in aisle one or aisle two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>If it was meal service, aisle one is blocked by the cart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So aisle two. What time was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content> Just before 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we found the body at 11:35, giving us about a 35 minute window before he was killed. Does anyone else remember seeing him in the back of the plane? Was he with someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Come on, you guys. Try to remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Maybe we can ask the passengers in back if they saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, if we did that word would get out that something was wrong. Word that could make it back to the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe there’s another way to know what Ford was doing at the back of this aisle. How long have those two gentlemen been taking selfies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>The honeymooners? Since their first Pimm’s cup. They’re adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have to talk to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>What should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have the hardest job of all. Pretend like everything’s normal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content> I think for the rest of the trip we should talk like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>HUSBAND</speaker><content>So posh.  How do you say selfie in British?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content> Selfie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>HUSBAND</speaker><content>Sophie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don’t’ I grab a proper picture of the two of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>Oh! Great, thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>HUSBAND</speaker><content>Can you hurry up? My face is hurting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. One more for safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So how did you guys meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>It’s kind of a long story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I love long stories.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>It’s awful what you’re dealing with, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks for your help, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I just wish there was more I could do. I’m going to talk you through this, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Do you want to see the head wound first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah. But you’re going to need to get in really close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Try moving the hair back a little.  Yeah, there we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can you tell what he was hit with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mmm. It’s hard to say. Something oblong. A pipe, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Alexis, are you all right? It’s just another body. You’ve done this plenty of times before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s not the body I’m worried about. It’s the person who killed him and took his gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And looking at this, there is something I can tell you about who that person is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You and Lanie find something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No signs of a struggle. But it looks like Ford died from a single blow to the back of the head. The left parietal bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the killer must have caught him by surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The bigger news is the angle of the blow indicates whoever did this was left handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Statistically speaking, that rules out most everyone on the plane. Good work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The gay couple? Are they suspects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah, I really doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then why do you have their selfies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I emailed them to myself off their phone. That’s … a long story. Almost as long as the one about how they met. But they took these near the time Air Marshal Ford was at the back of the plane. I was hoping that he’d show up in one of them, along with the killer, but no luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Not even in the video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I didn’t check out that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>HUSBAND</speaker><content>Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>We did it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In the background. There he is.  There’s Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But he’s not with anybody. He was checking the overhead bin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but for what? Not his own bag. He was up here in first with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Let’s play it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe something’s in there? Ford said he was on to a possible threat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But he’s not even looking inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Because the overhead bin is a ruse. See how Ford is glancing over his shoulder? He’s clocking someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re right.  It’s this guy. 26B. And look. He realizes Ford is watching him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>26B … 26B. Isadore Baldon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Isadore Baldon, 25, of Brooklyn. No criminal record, but … we have a problem, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He doesn’t match the man you described. We contacted Baldon. He’s actually here, in town. His passport was stolen weeks ago. Whoever’s sitting in 26B, it’s not Isadore Baldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe that’s why Ford was watching him. He got on to that somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then moments later Ford was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think we found our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>What’s he doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sweating bullets. He’s nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Of course he’s nervous. He just killed Kyle Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>We don’t know that, Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>He’s flying on a stolen passport. He requested a seat in the back, near the cargo hold. You saw the video. Ford was watching him and now he’s dead. Debbie, you can’t tell me he doesn’t meet the criteria for posing a threat to passengers and crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>No, he definitely does. Under the circumstances we’re empowered to detain him. And we have the training to do so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t think you should. Not just yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Well, you’re not responsible for the people on this plane. We are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Yeah. And if he did it, he has a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>And I, for one, don’t want to wait for him to start shooting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what if he’s not our guy? You go out there and take him down it’ll start a panic, alert the real killer, and he may pull a gun anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Okay. So what do you propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to identify him. Figure out who it is we’re dealing with.  Isn’t it about time for another drink service?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>It would be, except for that the airlines cut back so now we’re only allowed -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jim. Jim. My treat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Trash. Thank you. Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Can I take that for you, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well played, Farrah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>What are we doing now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He’s using the graphite from his mechanical pencil to make fingerprint powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw this on MacGyver once. You know, I actually met Richard Dean Anderson. You know what he said –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can you please do it already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>It’s actually working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>I got a hit off the FBI database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Aiman Haddad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>He’s a Syrian national in the US on a student visa. Enrolled at Hudson University. 24 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, if he’s here legally then why would he be travelling on a stolen passport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It might be because the FBI has him on the no-fly list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Apparently Aiman Haddad is affiliated with ISIS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s a terrorist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It gets worse. I just talked to Haddad’s roommate at Hudson. He said that Haddad had recently become super religious and sold all his stuff, and when the roommate asked why, Haddad said that he wasn’t going to be needing it anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We gotta tell Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Thank you for letting me know. I’ll call you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What is it? What did Beckett say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want you to go back to first class. Stay there until I tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Be careful, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I take it he’s a bad guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s on the no-fly list and for good reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>So he’s a terrorist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He murdered the air marshal. Now that is a bold act committed by someone not concerned what happens to him once the plane lands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Because maybe the plane won’t be landing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think we can assume the worst. Assume that his plan is bigger than killing Kyle Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Okay, we know what to do. First, we isolate him if possible –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>I’ll control his hands so he doesn’t go for the gun or … something worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>I’ll get the zip ties to secure him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. And like you said, I think we should do this quietly. Try to get him out of his seat and away from the other passengers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I could page him back to the rear galley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then he might get suspicious. That’s too risky. If he realizes we’re trying to take him down he may do something desperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>Hey, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Open the door! Open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Can you understand what he’s saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is it? Who are you talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you saying?  What was he saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>He said "they know" and "it’ll all be over soon".</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett. Just got off with Homeland Security. The number that Haddad was calling was traced to a Syrian mobile account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, did you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Do we know who he was calling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. State’s trying to coordinate with the Syrian government, but they’re not expecting any sort of cooperation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>AIMAN HADDAD</speaker><content>You are making a mistake! I have rights!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Okay, we checked his seat and his carryon and there’s no sign of a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, we can’t find the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he might have hidden it somewhere. Or he has a partner who’s on board. Either way, Castle, you’re going to have to interrogate him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’ve been with me in hundreds of interrogations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, just never when my life depended on it … along with everyone else’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys? I have more bad news. According to the airline, Haddad has a checked bag on the flight. FBI needs you to locate and search it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. And if we find something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>In the event there’s an explosive device the bomb squad will walk you through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We need to find his luggage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>No, no, no. I need you and Farrah upstairs keeping things calm. The passengers are starting to ask questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>What did you tell them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>That an gentleman had too much to drink, but I’m not sure they believed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ll go.  The faster we find it the safer we’ll be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All right. Wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t need it. You’ve done this a million times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll let you know if I find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Please. This is all a terrible mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Isadore Baldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we should try this again. We know you are Aiman Haddad and that you have ties with ISIS. Now, what is you plan and who are you working with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“They know and it’ll all be over soon.” That’s what you said upstairs on the phone. Who were you talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-30"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Why should I answer when I can see that you won’t believe me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Closest I came was a 90 year old who had a heart attack. Luckily that one had a happy ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This one will, too. How long have you been doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Thirty years. Thought I’d seen it all. Every crazy passenger, every country, now this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>If anyone can figure it out, my dad can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Good thing he’s on this flight. You’re lucky to have family like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess I am. What about you? You have kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Ah… what can I say? I was always up in the air.  Got it. Isadore Baldon. This is his bag.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, I’m not a cop. And I’m not an air marshal. But I’m going to find out what you’re up to. Do you know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because my daughter is on this plane and I’m not going to let anything happen to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>I am not a terrorist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re on the no-fly list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Only because my idiot cousin decided to join ISIS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re flying on a stolen passport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>I couldn’t travel under my own name, so how else should I fly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why the sudden urgency to fly in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>I need to go back to Syria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why? What’s your mission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>My mission? I have to go home. My mother is very sick. Pancreatic cancer. I petitioned the TSA. I went through the proper channels. But now she only has a few weeks to live. She is the one I was talking to on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Explain this. See how the air marshal is staring right at you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>He’s the air marshal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>He saw I was nervous, didn’t he? Is he the reason I’m being detained?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you might say that. He realized you were up to something so you followed him to the back of the plane and you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Killed him? What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We found him, right over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>No. No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. In fact, seconds after that this man got numerous texts on his phone and began texting back and then he rushed off. This is the last I saw of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We have his phone, Haddad. He only sent one text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>No, I know what I saw. He got a bunch of texts. Five, at least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad? Could I see you for a second?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> We checked his luggage. No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, State can’t confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad’s story checks out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out that Air Marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It was his personal cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t find a second phone on the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if it had evidence on it it’s possible the killer removed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can we recover his texts without the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s going to take some time to get the phone company to release them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And time is something we don’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And none of this clears Haddad. This could all be a smoke screen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Something for us to chase while his real plan unfolds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need that phone. If Ford was texting then he must have been connected to the plane’s Wi-Fi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Which means the phone may still be connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. So can Tory ping his cell using the Find My Users app? Make it beep?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Okay, I’m in. I’ve linked his number into the app. Ready to ping when you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Stand by.  All right everyone. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Ready. Farrah and I are in coach and Jim is in first class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Watch for anyone reaching for their phone. Ford’s phone could be in the killer’s hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Pinging now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Over there.  False alarm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Do you hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If someone removed the battery or even turned it off Tory’s not going to be able to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I have something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, crap. I hate snakes. How long does it take a snake to pass a –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>There it is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s locked. We need his passcode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Or his fingerprint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am so sorry about this. And thank you for your service to our country.  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s gotta be at least a dozen texts on here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>You see? I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> “Hey sexy, wanna have some fun?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> “Who is this?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> “Meet me in the back of the plane and you’ll find out.” But then when they refused to reveal their identity Ford won’t meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Look, the texts start to get hostile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> “Do what I say or you’ll have a situation on your hands.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> “What kind of situation?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> “The kind you’re hired to prevent.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> “It’s a federal offense to threaten an aircraft.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> “It’s not a threat if I follow through and take down this plane.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Whoever's behind this is still on the plane.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Beckett, I’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. Hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Those texts on the marshal’s phone, they were sent from a prepaid phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you trace it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>No, it looks like it’s been turned off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, run down that number. See if you can find out who bought it and from where.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you still there?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m here. Whoever’s behind this did their homework. They had Ford’s personal number and they knew exactly how to manipulate him. They must have known him somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got the boys digging into Ford’s life. Financials, movements, phone records. They’re looking for anything that’ll connect him to someone on that flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, tell them to dig a little faster before our texter makes good on his threat to take us down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. Me too. Call me when you have something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We just can’t sit around and wait for word from the precinct. There has to be something we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe there is. Only ten percent of the population is left handed. There must be a way for us to figure out who of the passengers is a southpaw, thus narrowing our suspect pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>We could pass out customs and immigration forms. Then we’d know who’s left handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Brilliant. Now you’re thinking like a mystery writer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Think this will work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s better than doing nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Too bad we didn’t sleep through this, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m just making sure it’s still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Beckett, I got it. The phone that texted the marshal. The phone was purchased online and picked up at the airport at a Flight Tech Express store less than half an hour before the flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Does the store have any cameras?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>No. And the cameras in the airport don’t have a good angle on the register. But we don’t need video. The purchaser used a credit card. We have her name. And I checked the manifest. She’s on the plane.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marilyn Singer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s a former Oceanic executive who got fired last year. And Castle, get this. She filed a wrongful termination suit accusing the airline of blackballing her. And last week the judge ruled against her in favor of Oceanic Airlines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she wants to –  – so she wants to take down one of their planes for revenge? That seems a little extreme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, Castle. But it’s consistent with the texts she sent the air marshal. And what better way for her to destroy the airline she believes ruined her life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What seat is she in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That’s Marilyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The hair, the glasses? She did not want to be recognized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad. Left hand. It’s her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out whatever her plan is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go to your seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something very stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She has a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is why I want you as far away as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You know I feel the same way about you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I do. I do. Now, go back to your seat. Please.  I’m going to need a glass of wine. Red.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! I am so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>My apologies, ma’am. I have stain remover in the galley. Come with me. We’ll clean you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MARILYN SINGER</speaker><content>Thank you, no. I’ve got detergent wipes in my bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Ma’am, you don’t want that to set. Come back with me and we’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>Don’t touch me. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you should go with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>I said I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated. We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>I’m telling you, this is some kind of mistake. That gun is not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was your plan, Marilyn? Take hostages? Try to bring down the plane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>Bring down the plane? What the hell are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic. And the threatening texts you sent from this phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>That is not my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was in your purse. Paid for with your credit card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>Where’s Kyle? I want to talk to Kyle. I know he’s the air marshal on this flight. Did he put you up to this? Because it is not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is it that you know Mr. Ford?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>He’s my boyfriend. All right? And if he thinks he’s teaching me a lesson I’m going to be seriously pissed. Now, where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marilyn. Kyle is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content> Dead? Kyle’s dead? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You should know. His gun was in your purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>No. I – I don’t understand what’s going on. Someone else must have put that in my bag with the phone when I was in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I suppose you always wear a wig when you travel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>You don’t understand. I thought – I thought Kyle was having an affair. It was our six month anniversary and we were supposed to go away for the weekend. But at the last minute Kyle called and said that he had to work this flight. That he had to fill in for someone. But there was something in his voice. Like he wasn’t telling me the whole story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you decided to stalk him? Follow him onto this plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>We met in the air. Fell in love on the long haul. I thought maybe he’d found someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that why you lured him back here? To confront him? And when it all went south you killed him in a rage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content>No. I wouldn’t do that. Please. You have to believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t afford to. Jim, take her down below. Make sure she’s secure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Just – when I told her Ford was dead her reaction seemed … so real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, the gun and phone were in her purse. She’s left handed. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know, I know. Everything fits. But why buy a prepaid phone online just to pick it up at the airport store minutes later? Why not just walk into the store and buy it? And why use a credit card? That can be traced back to her, unless …  … unless that was part of the plan. To give us the perfect suspect so we’d stop looking for the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You think someone set her up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think something else is going on here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Castle, you’ve been through a lot up there, so maybe your storyteller’s imagination is getting the best of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m telling you, there’s a lot more going on here. Someone wants us to think that this is over. But it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle may be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We contacted the air marshal service. Ford wasn’t filling in for anyone. He requested to be on that flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We also double checked Ford’s financial records and we found a transaction that just posted. Turns out $9,950 was wired to his bank account just minutes before takeoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just under the ten thousand dollar mark. Someone didn’t want to tip off the Feds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whatever’s going on up there, Ford is involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s the money from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy.  Victor Christoph Dietrich. He’s a wealthy German industrialist. A big name in the import/export business. US Customs officials had flagged him several times for violations but nothing ever stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Do you think Ford requested to be on this flight because Dietrich paid him to be on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where is Dietrich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His office is two blocks away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I want him here. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>VICTOR DIETRICH</speaker><content>I am sorry, Detectives, but I’ve never seen him before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why was $10,000 transferred from your bank account to his, Mr. Dietrich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>Must be some kind of banking error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s not. Both of your financial institutions confirmed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>It isn’t a crime to give a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so it’s a gift, now? To someone that you don’t even know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>This has been delightful, but I’m afraid I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um, no. You’re not going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>You have no cause to hold me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we do. As a material witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>A witness to what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The murder of a federal air marshal on a transatlantic flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>Murder?  Air Marshal Ford is – is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. Now, what was the money for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>Security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What kind of security?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>I consult with Brampton’s Auction House. I hired Mr. Ford to provide protection for a piece we acquired from the Met that was … being transported on that plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of a piece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>It is an Art Deco era Louis Calliat Celestialis watch worth $13.3 million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Ford was carrying it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>He was merely keeping an eye on it. One of our in-house apprentices is actually wearing the timepiece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You gave an apprentice a 13 million dollar watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a common auction house practice. They fly an employee to a foreign country wearing the goods so that they don’t have to claim it or pay taxes on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>With such a valuable piece I wanted real security for the flight, and Ford was backing up my courier. That was all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except that wasn’t all. Something went awry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>DIETRICH</speaker><content>Yes. The courier stopped replying to my texts shortly after takeoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was the courier’s name and where was he sitting?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aaron Rich. Aaron, wake up. Hey.  I think he’s been drugged. Wake up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s part of the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>The suspect is in custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>AARON</speaker><content>No! No, no, no. I wasn’t supposed to fall asleep.  Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>AARON</speaker><content>Hey. Hey! Hey, let go of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t thank God just yet. This watch is a fake. The real Celestialis is self-winding. This watch has a knob. Which mean this was never about terrorism. It was about a heist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>AARON</speaker><content>I don’t – I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re wearing a knockoff. It got switched out while you were sleeping. You weren’t supposed to realize it until you were off the plane and the real watch was long gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That obnoxious guy who had his seat changed. Was this originally where he was supposed to sit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Yes, but Mr. Ford put in a request for that seat two days ago and air marshals get priority, so the system assigned it to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knew it was the perfect vantage point from which to watch the watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But the thief must have found out. And they couldn’t steal the watch with an air marshal sitting right there so they had to lure Ford out of first class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Using a phone that, if traced, would lead them back to Ford’s girlfriend, who had a motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, that means the thief knows who’s on the plane. They had access to the manifest. Seat assignments. Ford’s personal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And passenger credit cards. This was an inside job.  Aaron, who served you this drink? Because someone spiked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>AARON</speaker><content>I can’t remember.  But it’s usually her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>No. No, I did not drug anybody!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, she couldn’t have. She was serving us over in aisle two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, it was …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Stay back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Debbie? You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Thirty years, Farrah. Thirty years of loyal service. I was finally ready to retire. So what does Oceanic do? They restructure and eliminate our pensions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Debbie –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t want to do this. Drop the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-29"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>Do you have any idea what it’s like? Serving this little punk kid in first class every month? Hearing him brag about how much money he’s got strapped to his wrist? When I have nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-30"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So when you found out he was taking this flight again you decided to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-31"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content>I heard about that watch. How it was going to auctioned off. That’s 13 million. But nobody – nobody was supposed to get hurt. Right, I just – I just needed Ford to step away for, like, a minute. But when he saw Aaron was sleeping –  – he knew. He tracked me down to the cargo hold …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-32"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Debbie, what the airline did to you was unfair. But please, don’t make it worse. This isn’t who you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-33"><speaker>DEBBIE</speaker><content> It’s not. It’s not.</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>FARRAH</speaker><content>We’ll be landing soon. You can go ahead and retake your seat. With our apologies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>MARILYN</speaker><content> Thank you for believing in me, Mr. Castle. And for bringing Kyle’s killer to justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m – I’m very sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Haddad. Unfortunately, when the plane lands you’re going to be detained for travelling on a stolen passport. However, I had my friends in New York make some calls. If your story checks out the authorities here are going to allow you to travel to Syria to see your family before you face charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>HADDAD</speaker><content>Thank you, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you. I am very proud of the way you handled yourself today. What you said to Debbie, it was … very brave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks. You know, I think I’m going to postpone my pub date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought you said you didn’t want to be attached at the hip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, well, after what happened today I kinda do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
