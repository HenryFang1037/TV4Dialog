<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello. I’m serious and brooding Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I am friendly, accessible, ruggedly handsome Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow, Dad. Could your head get any bigger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you blame me? I’m accepting the Poe’s Pen career achievement award. It is the biggest honor a mystery writer can get. I am joining the pantheon of greats to whose heights I have always aspired, so …which big head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … I like the ruggedly handsome, smiling giant you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm. I like the serious, brooding giant you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. All right, Mother. You are the tie-breaker. Which of these should be hanging behind me at the ceremony next week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh, darling, you know I refuse to play favorites. I love both of my son’s big heads equally.  All right, I am off to meet a friend of mine whose father just passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Martha, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. Don’t be. He had a rich, full life. And, more importantly, he has a rent controlled loft in Chelsea. Which, if I play my cards right, could be mine.  Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there’s the death-is-opportunity spirit we all love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, looks like we have another opportunity of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Let’s head out. We’ll go head-to-head later. See where I’m heading?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, with this award, you going for captain? We could be New York’s newest power couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle, don’t jinx it. I haven’t even gotten my results back yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s you. You aced it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>No, man. It was the guy with the axe in his heart. He bled out in the Barcalounger. We called him lord of the flies. No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, no, no. You’re wrong, bro. It was the pet shop owner whose wife fed him to the dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you guys fighting about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The first case that Captain Montgomery partnered us on. Ten years ago today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? It’s your manniversary? And I didn’t get you anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s still time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>You folks from the 12th? I’m Trooper Collins. Thanks for coming out of your jurisdiction.  Our victim’s a Jane Doe. It appears she was attacked in the woods and chased onto the road where she was hit by that truck. Because of the assault we’re classifying the death as a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea where she was coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>It’s state game land. Not a house for miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea on the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>No. And we ran her prints but they’re not on file. We’ve got our teams out there searching the woods, but we found these tucked into her bra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A fifty dollar bill, key card, and a cash receipt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>From a coffee shop in the city. Dated yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This card looks like a hotel key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>But it’s not from anywhere around here. We think maybe she was staying in the city. We were hoping you could help us track down who she is and what she was doing here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Trooper Collins? These carvings on her face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>The crosses? Freaky, right? We think she was maybe running from whoever did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They look ritualistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>Yeah. And it gets freakier. Just as that trucker hit the girl he says he saw something emerge from the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>A dark figure wearing a mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of mask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>He was pretty shaken, so we didn’t press. We’ll get a full statement from him once he’s been treated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>TROOPER COLLINS</speaker><content>At the hospital in Woodburry.  Excuse me. Trooper Collins. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to talk to that driver.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>I tried to stop, I did. But she just came out of nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Walters, the Trooper said you saw something in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>Yeah.  It almost didn’t seem real, like it was some kind of ghost. Freaky as all hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you describe it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>It wore a dark, ragged coat. Um … with a mask, like a doll’s face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like porcelain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>Yeah. It was white with black where the eyes should have been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Were there markings on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>Like streaked teardrops coming from the eyes. And the face, it was, uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bisected with two black lines, like a cross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>TRUCKER</speaker><content>Yeah. How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It was real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, I’ve seen that mask before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sketches from the truck driver. You ready to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was eleven years old. Uh … my mother was touring with Pippin. I was in New Hampshire, staying with the family of a classmate for President’s Day weekend. Their home abutted a few hundred acres of state forest called Hollander’s Woods. We were told never to go into the woods alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somebody told you not to so you had to do it anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I walked for hours. I was cold, completely lost, and that’s when I saw him. A figure clad in black, kneeling. And after a few moments he left and that’s when I saw her on the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A body. The first body I ever saw. He throat had been slit and those same symbols were carved into her forehead and her cheeks. I touched her arm. I remember thinking how cold it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MASKED ASSAILANT</speaker><content>Tell anyone what you’ve seen here today and I’ll find you and kill you. Do you understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>MASKED ASSAILANT</speaker><content>Go!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why do you think he let you live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. I waited until I got back to the city to call the police. From a payphone. I was too scared to let them know who I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who was the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s just the thing. They searched the woods with cadaver dogs. They never found a body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you never figured out who she was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I checked local papers. No one in the area had been reported missing. When I got older I checked with missing persons, even the FBI database, for anyone matching her description, or any crimes involving those symbols or that mask, but there was nothing. It’s like it never happened. And after a while I just … started to wonder if it had. That day in the woods, Kate, that’s why I do what I do. I’m driven to figure out the story because –  – I could never figure out that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you ever tell me this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I didn’t want it to be real. But it is real. He’s real. He killed before and he just tried to kill again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I checked with the police department near Hollander’s Woods. Their logs do show that they received a call in February of ’83 reporting a body. But after coming up empty they assumed it was a prank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, what about the FBI database?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s been no other occurrences in the past thirty years of any assaults or murders with this MO. Beckett, this thing that Castle says happened … it was decades ago. Is he really sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>As sure as I’ve ever seen him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, our Jane Doe? Anything on that coffee shop receipt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, a barista there remembered seeing our victim. She wasn’t a regular there but she’d been in several times in the past few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was anyone with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. She came in alone, she’d get her drink, take a seat, and spend hours staring out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, why don’t we set up a canvass of the neighborhood. Maybe somebody there knows who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>After all these years do you really think it could be the same killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We won’t know until we find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. That key card that we found on the victim? It was tracked to an extended stay motel out in Queens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She paid cash for the room, didn’t present an ID. Registered as Jane Smith. Not her real name, I’m guessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we still don’t know who she is. Did she have a car when she checked in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. A cab dropped her off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means someone took her to those woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long had she been staying here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>About two weeks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, check the drawers. See if we can find anything to ID our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Photos? All of the same woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>License plate numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hundreds of them. Along with the registered address of each of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would she have that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at the numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Each one has the letters X and Z in it. Our victim’s looking for someone specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think I know someone we can ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>FRANK MALLOY</speaker><content>I knew something bad would happen to Emma. I was trying to find her, to stop her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Malloy, what was your daughter doing in the city?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Two months ago a friend of hers disappeared. Emma was trying to find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait –  – was this her friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Yeah. Zoey Addison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what exactly do you mean by ‘she disappeared’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Zoey had a boyfriend who was beating on her. So she took his car and was on her way to stay with Emma, but she never showed. A couple days later the cops found the car by the side of the road with a busted radiator. But no sign of Zoey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did they talk to the boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Well, yeah. He was two states away with an alibi. He reported the car stolen, so the cops just figured that Zoey was on the run and ditched it for another ride. But Emma knew that Zoey wouldn’t do that. Not without calling. So Emma took a leave from her cashier’s job to try to find her. Retracing her route, Emma found a waitress at a truck stop who saw Zoey get into the back of a white sedan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With New York plates containing the letters X and Z?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Yeah. The waitress told Emma it had an oval sticker in its back window that said NYC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what she was doing in the city. She was trying to track the car Zoey got into. Mr. Malloy, do these woods mean anything to you? Is there any reason that Emma would be in them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Were they on Zoey’s route, maybe? Somewhere near where she disappeared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No, Zoey was coming from Pittsburgh. The opposite direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And all this time no one’s heard anything from her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Zoey didn’t have family. And if it wasn’t for Emma no one would have even known she disappeared.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why I could never find the girl I found in the woods. He targets people who won’t be missed. Hitchhikers, stranded motorists. He asks them a couple of questions. If they fit the profile, he kills them. And if not, he’s just some good Samaritan giving them a ride. That’s why he didn’t kill me. It would have attracted attention. Thirty years. How many times do you think he did this? Ten? Twenty? A hundred? I should have found a way to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you were eleven years old. And what happened to you back then was terrible, and I know that you’re thinking of this case as a way to exorcise those demons, but we don’t know what we have here. We don’t even know if this is the same person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Of course it’s the same person. Emma must have been able to do what I never could. She tracked him down. That’s why he went after her. I have to find this guy, Kate. I need to end this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys, is there any way to check police records from thirty years ago? See if there were any abandoned cars ticketed within a fifty mile radius of Hollander’s Woods?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sure. We just have to call all municipal police departments in the area –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And wait for them to stop laughing long enough to beg them to check their dusty storage rooms –  – you’re serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to know exactly what we’re dealing with, here, so … happy manniversay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett? A word?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Close the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I just got a call from 1PP. They want me to take you off shift tonight for a performance review.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, sir, my review’s not scheduled for another three months.  Do you think this has something to do with the captain’s exam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, they don’t ask for a meet to discuss exam results. They notify you by mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t know. And none of my sources are talking, but they want you there at 7:30.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe it’s good news. Maybe you’re getting an award, too. A career achievement in homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, it’s probably not that. But still, it could be good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, why is my cop sense telling me it’s bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Got something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I was running those license plates on Emma’s lists, seeing if any of the owners have criminal backgrounds, when I noticed this car registered to an address right down the street from the coffee shop where Emma went the day that she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was surveilling that car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She must have thought it was the one that Zoey got into at the truck stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when the owner of the car realized she was onto him, he went after her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whose car is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>That’s the weird thing. It belongs to this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Connie Lewis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>But she’s 72 and has no criminal record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s her address?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There it is. White sedan. X and Z in the plate. NYC sticker in the window. Exactly as Emma’s witness described.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but how’s a 72 year old woman connected to all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After all these years we finally get some answers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Lewis? NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s open.  TV’s on. Mrs. Lewis? Can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Lewis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Lewis?  Mrs. Lewis? Mrs. Lewis?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>There were no outward signs of trauma or carvings in her skin, but until I get her back to the morgue we can’t rule out homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long has she been dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on decay I’d say about three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did no one notice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The killer did and he used her car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And maybe her place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett.  Look what I found in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The same matchbook that we found in Emma’s hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Emma was tailing the killer she could have followed him there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I tracked down Lewis’s next of kin. Only family listed is a son. I found this number for him in her things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>910 area code? Where’s that from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>North Carolina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll handle the notification, see what he knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not much, if he hasn’t seen her in three years. What kind of son doesn’t check on his own mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not all families get along. My father didn’t talk to his brother for twenty years –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Check for the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s been moved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You inside, drop your weapon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s a hole in the floor. You guys, he’s below us. Let’s go!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Noah Lewis, 52. He did a stint in the army back in the 90s. There’s no recent record of employment. He told the neighbors that his mother was bedridden and that he was taking care of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So they just assumed he was the good son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but the relationship was far from rosy. Four years ago his mother had him committed to a state mental institution after he threatened her with a knife. So I got in touch with the state-appointed shrink who was treating him. He says that Noah has borderline personality disorder and exhibited violent tendencies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it’s him? Any record of where he was thirty years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, we’re a little bit more focused on where he is now. We have teams still combing the neighborhood. We put out a BOLO but so far nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your theory about the killer’s MO may have just paid off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You found something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. From February of ’83. The day after you saw that body police ticketed an abandoned pickup truck they saw by the roadside near Hollander’s Woods. The truck belonged to a farmer who loaned it to a young woman, a migrant worker, to go out and make a supply run. When the cops told the farmer that they found his truck he assumed that she’s just run off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he never reported her missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. He didn’t want to get her in trouble with immigration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he remember who she was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And he had her photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Rosalita Cambeau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll dig deeper into Noah, see if we can connect him to that area thirty years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll find him, Castle. I promise. Uh … I’m supposed to head off to my review. Do you want me to postpone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … no, I should go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll be all right.  I’ll call you when I’m done, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey. Are you busy? I can –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I was just … um, reading something I wrote a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, how old were you when you knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Knew what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That you wanted to be a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since I was a kid, I guess. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m finishing my junior year and I have no idea what I want to do. By the time you were my age you’d already published your first book and now you’re winning this amazing award because you followed your passion. How can I be amazing if I can’t find mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Trust me. You will. Or … or it’ll find you. And one day you will look back and you will realize that every experience you’ve ever had, every seeming mistake or blind alley, was actually a straight line to who you were meant to be. And whatever you become, there is no question in my mind you are going to be amazing. And you know how I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because you already are.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>KEITH KAUFMAN</speaker><content>Take a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>So, Detective Beckett. It says here you took the captain’s exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>What makes you think you’re qualified to be captain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My experience in the 12th Precinct has made me comfortable in a leadership position and at this point –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>What I mean is, what makes you think you’re even qualified to be an NYPD detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>Your job is to enforce the law, yet you have repeatedly ignored it. In Los Angeles you investigated a case outside your legal jurisdiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>You used your badge to pursue a personal vendetta against Senator Bracken, crossing the line and endangering the lives of others numerous times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, that man was a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>You've withheld case information from superiors and flown in the face of authority whenever it suits you. Not to mention your working relationship with Richard Castle. Tell me, Detective, how often have you let your personal feelings for your husband dictate your actions in pursuit of a suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, that is unfair. I never let –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>When he went missing you used your position and a great deal of the taxpayers' money to search for him, enlisting the aid of fellow detectives and, well, you are infamous for being the inspiration for the fictional NYPD detective Nikki Heat, who spends more time on her back than she does pursuing killers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, how do you expect to lead, or even continue in your current job, when it’s clear you’ve exercised such poor judgment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, if you were looking at my record –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>We are looking at your record! You are not qualified for captaincy and in my opinion, you are not qualified to be a detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>Thank you. You can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re wrong, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I said, you’re wrong. In every case you have referenced I have not only successfully brought the killer to justice I have done so with the utmost respect for the law and for the department I represent. And regarding my relationship with Mr. Castle, he has proven to be a brilliant partner and he’s always had my back. And as for his fictional representation of me, I’m proud to have been his inspiration and I am proud to be his wife. You asked, how do I expect to lead? By continuing to fight for what’s right, not for what’s easy. My job is to protect the citizens of New York and I will do it by doing my job better than anyone else and getting results. I don’t cross the line. I put myself on it. And if you have any other questions then you can ask the families of the victims that I have served.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>PAUL GIBNEY</speaker><content>Detective Beckett?  Sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>GIBNEY</speaker><content>That was an impassioned and powerful response. In fact, it was exactly what we were hoping for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-24"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>This wasn’t a performance review.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why would you attack me like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-26"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>We wanted to see if you could defend yourself. Kate, this was an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-28"><speaker>GIBNEY</speaker><content>Your future. We’ve been looking for someone like you. Someone who isn’t corruptible. A certifiable hero who the people can get behind. Kate, you’re bigger than what you’re doing now. You know it. It’s why you went to DC, why you took the captain’s exam. You want a bigger stage and we want to give it to you. We think you have an amazing future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-30"><speaker>KAUFMAN</speaker><content>We’d like you to run for New York State Senate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>State senator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And they say it’s just the start. Apparently the party has had their eye on me for a while now. They think that people are looking for someone like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. I’m a cop. I’m not a politician.  Did I even tell you I was in Model U.N. when I was a kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My mom was one of the chaperones and after watching me she said, “You know, Katie, you can grow up and be anything you want.” I just wanted to be her. I just wanted to make a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you have. Question now is, can you make a bigger difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, if you saw the way that they attacked me in that room? And in a campaign it would only be worse. You, Alexis, my dad, Martha. You guys would all be fair game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re a tough bunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you think I could do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They said that I aced my captain’s exam. I could probably have my own precinct within the year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When do you have to decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, whatever you decide, I will back your play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That matchbook lead paid off. The unit that we put on that bar spotted Noah Lewis heading inside. ESU just took him down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They found him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>Where’s my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Being autopsied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>I warned her. But she wouldn’t stop running her mouth at me. Now she doesn’t say a word. It’s what she deserved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about the others? Did they deserve what they got? We know what you’ve done, Noah. Who you really are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell us about Emma Malloy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>I’m not good with names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you the night before last?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>Out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Out where? Neighbors said your car was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>I took a drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you drive to the woods?  Or what about this girl? Zoey Addison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was seen getting into your car, Noah. Now she’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>Mmm. She’s pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is she dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>I can’t help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where do you take them? The others. How do you make them disappear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have your car, Noah. Your house. We will find evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Emma find evidence? Is that why you went after her? Because she got too close? Is that why you shot at us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>NOAH</speaker><content>You were in my house! Don’t you see? I’m the victim here. I’m the victim.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just … he’s been getting away with it for thirty years. I thought he’s be more … vulnerable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We have a problem. I just spoke with CSU. So far they haven’t found anything in the house or the car that links Noah to Emma or Zoey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we can’t connect him to either of their murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about his mother’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Autopsy results indicate that she died of natural causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right now, all we have this guy on is mishandling a body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He shot at us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but he was hiding in the closet at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He can claim he didn’t know we were cops. He can plead out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, we can’t even link this guy to Hollander’s Woods. In ’83 he was at a military academy all the way in South Carolina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was President’s Day weekend. He could have been on vacation, or – or just skipping school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Except those records are gone, so there’s no way to prove it. All a jury’s going to hear is that he was a thousand miles away from New Hampshire. Without evidence we don’t have a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The key to this is Emma. We need to place his car in the area at the time she was attacked. Let’s coordinate with Collins and set up a canvass up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> There’s gotta be a place he goes. Somewhere out of the way where he puts the bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You said that he was seeing a shrink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, a uh … a Dr. Van Holtzman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, maybe Noah said something during a session that could help us. Where do we find Holtzman?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Noah ends up walking you’re going to have to have me committed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me, we need to speak with Dr. Holtzman, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Of course. Just a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Listen, if after seven years of your crazy theories you haven’t already been committed, then I think you’re pretty safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m Detective Beckett, this is Richard Castle. We need to speak with you regarding one of your patients, Noah Lewis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Of course. Let me just finish with these prescriptions and I’ll be right with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, I know that voice. From that day in Hollander’s Woods. It’s him. He’s the killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, that was over thirty years ago. You can’t possibly –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, when he spoke I could feel the knife at my throat. I will never forget that voice as long as I live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Sorry about that. Shall we talk in my office?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Please, have a seat. I wish I could say that I was surprised to hear what Noah had done but he was very troubled. We did everything we could for him while he was in our care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Holtzman, how long have you been treating Mr. Lewis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Four years. We got him stable after his mother committed him, but the condition of his release were state mandated sessions every month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did the two of you talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Anger, intimacy, his animosity towards women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You went to Dartmouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Yes. For undergrad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … when was the last time you saw Mr. Lewis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>A few days ago. He was quite agitated. He thought someone was following him. I thought he was just being paranoid so I adjusted his meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you had no idea that he was about to do something violent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s done this before, you know. Abducted women, killed them in the woods. Possibly for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Witnesses. When he does it he wears a mask. Now, why would he do that, wear a mask when he kills them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you had to guess. What kind of psychosis would drive a man to do that? Something … terrible in his childhood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>The mind of a psychopath is not that simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he kills them anyway.  So why would he need to hide his face behind this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>Maybe he’s not hiding it. Maybe this is his true face. The monster he knows he really is, and he wants his victims to see it and fear it before they die. Maybe his real mask is the man he has to pretend to be every day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His voice. I know, it sounds crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because it is, Castle. We already have a suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, but the perfect suspect. Because Dr. Holtzman knew intimate details about his patients. He set Noah up to take the fall just in case anyone got onto the murders. And Holtzman was in New Hampshire, at Dartmouth, in 1983.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s a family man. Married to his wife for twenty-four years. Kids. Well respected. Never been arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And witnesses. They saw the victim get into Noah’s car, not Holtzman’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – can't explain that yet, but Holtzman is behind this. And …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Babe, the voice – is it possible you’re misremembering? You’ve made this killer your personal boogeyman. You said so yourself, you wanted him to be more formidable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s clean. He has no connection to this case. We’ve got nothing to go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Less than nothing. All we have is a thirty year old voice ID from a witness who was a kid at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Castle, we want to solve it as much as you do –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? I expected this from these guys. Just … not from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You said it was him. I believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except you’re right. There’s nothing we can do. We’d have to sit on him for years hoping he makes a move.  This is not how the story was supposed to end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was thinking, how did he make those victims disappear without a trace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he would’ve had to have taken them somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somewhere his family didn’t know about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’d have to have had a lair. A storage space somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too many things could go wrong. There could be a flood, a nosy manager. He would have to find a place over which he had absolute control, so I did a property search. It came up empty on him, but I did find this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Farmland?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Owned by Holtzman’s parents. Both deceased. It’s listed in a trust. Holtzman is listed as the sole trustee. It’s possible his wife doesn’t know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s only a few miles from where Emma was hit by that truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tax records show that there’s a barn on the property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He must have held her there. It’s private, in the middle of nowhere, the perfect lonely place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only I would never get a warrant. And if I searched it without one, then any evidence I would find would be inadmissible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because you’re a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But … you’re not. It would be trespassing. You would be breaking the law. But if you found something… And I know how much this means to you, so whatever you decide I will back your play.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks deserted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the property line. You should stay back here on this side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, but you’re not going in alone.  Keep me on speaker. Let me know what you find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like he uses it for storage. Creepy, creepy storage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, he has the same car that Noah has. Same color, same license plate, same sticker, everything. That’s how he did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if someone spotted him it would lead right back to Noah. But you’re going to need more than that to call the police. Look around. He may have kept trophies from his victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, he’s here. He’s inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>How did you find me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve been looking for you since Hollander’s Woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>The boy. That was you? I should have killed you when I had the chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can’t win, Holtzman. We know who you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>HOLTZMAN</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. You’ll both be dead and they’ll never find me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I was. I just, um … I couldn’t help but wonder, if it wasn’t for him, for that day in the woods, would I even be here? Would we be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Babe, we’re not here because of him. We’re here because of who we are in the face of people like him. That’s why you write mysteries, that’s why I became a cop. We’re both trying to bring justice to this world.  Now –  – I’m going to go and get dressed so I can be very proud tonight of who you are.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>MICHAEL CONNELLY</speaker><content>Murder. Mystery. The macabre. Tonight’s honoree has mastered them all. For years he’s kept his readers under his spell with his electrifying prose. I’m very proud to present this year’s recipient of the Poe’s Pen Career Achievement award, my good friend, Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Michael Connelly, everyone. Thank you very much, Michael. And um … my thanks to all of you for this honor. You know, I’ve spent a lot of time the last few days thinking about how I got here. The long hours, the blank pages. Most people think that writing is a solitary profession, that we spend our days in our imaginary worlds, fighting, loving, dying, but we don’t do it alone. Because anything that’s good in our writing comes from truth and the truth is I’m here because of the people in my life. Mother, you will always be a star in my eyes. And Alexis, you amaze me every day. You two are my red-headed pillars of unconditional love. To my friends at the twelfth precinct, you let me in. Especially you two, Javier, Kevin. You’ve made me your brother in arms and I thank you for that. And Kate. Seven years ago I thought I would never write again and then you walked in the door and my whole world changed. You were right, you said I had no idea. But now I do. This is because of you, because of us. Always.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle, who’s going to be your inspiration if Beckett becomes state senator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, you won’t be able to follow her around anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe I’ll write a political thriller next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>JENNY RYAN</speaker><content>Ooh, I would so read that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Beckett, if you do run I’ll help with your campaign.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It’s a pretty big step, Kate. Have you decided what you’re going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not yet, but whatever it is I’m looking forward to the adventure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One thing’s for sure: things are going to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I know one thing that’ll never change.  What we all have. A toast. To us.</content></utterance>
