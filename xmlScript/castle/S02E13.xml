</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Meet the late Jack Coonan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Why is that name familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Because it probably crossed over all our desks a dozen times in the last few years. Aggravated assault, ADW, arson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Coonan had a heavy rep. Word is he’s an enforcer for the Westies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>DR LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>OK, remind me who are the Westies again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Irish Mafia out of Hell's Kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They deal in cargo theft, counterfeiting, extortion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And public urination on St Patrick’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our boy Coonan also had a home security system. Twelve gauge hollow point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That thing could stop a kodiak in Kevlar. Who did he think was coming through the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, whoever it was left him leaking from about thirty holes that don’t normally appear in a healthy thirty-five-year-old male.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nine millimetre Sig still in his waistband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Didn’t even have time to pull it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This guy was armed and ready. Whoever got him was very, very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ninja assassin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ninja assassin? Isn’t that kind of redundant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Aren't all ninjas by definition assassins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine, Webster and Roget. Our ninja  scales the building, slips in through this window and then hides himself. I don’t know about… hey, look at this, our victim's a Johnny Vong fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Someone actually bought those tapes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who’s Johnny Vong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, you're kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Every insomniac in New York knows who Johnny Vong is. His infomercial runs all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Your friends might tell…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, do you guys mind if we finish dealing with the dead guy on the carpet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Beckett, cell phone. Looks like it took a direct hit from the knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have Tech pull the SIM card. I want to know who Coonan was talking to before he died. Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RICHARD COONAN</speaker><content>Did ah… did my brother suffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Well, thank you for your honesty. I guess you could have lied to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I couldn’t. I’ve been on your side of the table and when I was, what I needed most was the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>I built schools in Afghanistan, you know, give kids over there a fighting chance. I get all this recognition and here’s my big brother Jacky, a guy who taught me to fight for the little guy. What does he get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Worse than he deserved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>I make no excuses for the things my brother did, but growing up we were on our own a lot. Jacky was the toughest kid on the block, that’s what first brought him to Rourke’s attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Finn Rourke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Mmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He runs the Westies. What did he actually do for Finn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Jacky never said, but whatever it was, I’m pretty sure it got him killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. These Westies can be pretty rough. So are you sure you don’t wanna stay in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK. Keep your mouth shut and um… try to butch up a little.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m looking for Finn Rourke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BARMAN</speaker><content>Is that right? Well as far as I’m concerned, you and your wife there can keep looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is the part where I tell you that one phone call from me and the Department of Health will be down here, you’ll be shut down for thirty days, I guarantee it. Do you really want to do that to your boss? It’s not like I’m asking you to cough up…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>FINN ROURKE</speaker><content>Oh dear, got to get out the game, Tommy, pint for the pretty boy huh? Settle his stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr Rourke, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. I’m here about Jack Coonan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>Ah, so you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did you last see Jack Coonan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>I don’t remember. In fact, none of us remember. I think you’ll find the Department of Health will take a very liberal attitude to my establishment. And this is the part where I tell you to pound sand, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Step away. Are you OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>MARIO MENDOZA</speaker><content>Me? Ah no, I’m good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mario Mendoza, also known as Trucho. You did four years upstate for distribution in Queens and you just got off with parole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got a dead Westie on my hands and it looked like you were about to join. So want to tell me what you were doing in Finn Rourke’s back room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>Can I be real with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, please do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>I had too much to drink, and I accidentally fell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You fell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>I fell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, how did you get that mouse on your eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>I ran into the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you burn your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>After I ran into the wall, and I fell, I put my hand out on the grill just to break my fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, thanks for keeping it real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I get it, the whole street code thing and all, but in my experience, Mario, guys like you end up catching another case sooner or later, and when you do, wouldn’t you like to have a detective on your side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>MENDOZA</speaker><content>No thanks, I’m good. Oww.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA</speaker><content>He was my collar from back in the day. Guy ran dope for the Latin Kings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Latin Kings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a violent street gang, they mostly peddle girls and drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>MAZZARA</speaker><content>Trucho’s their blade man, real handy with the knife. We never popped him for murder, but I’ve met plenty of folks with fingers missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So was there bad blood between them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>MAZZARA</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re like the Hatfields and McCoys of Hell's Kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the Westies figure that the Latin Kings killed Coonan and they snatch their blade guy and bring him in for a little enhanced interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which no one wants to admit to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>MAZZARA</speaker><content>In my experience, if Finn went all Gitmo on him it was for a reason. You got a Westie with holes in him, Trucho’s probably your guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s right. We found Trucho’s vehicle in an alley behind a little bodega in Regal Park. It’s a big dope spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And he left his little letter opener tucked behind the driver's side sun visor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That’s not it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t even look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Sure I did. It’s a stiletto, four-inch Damascus blade and is way too small to make these wounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe he used a different knife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Just how tall is this Trucho?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s, um, five six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Standing on his toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Then he’s not your guy. Thrust angle on these wounds indicate Coonan’s killer was over six foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe instead of using a stiletto he was wearing stilettos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Techs got some hits off Coonan’s phone; maybe they can shed some light. Thank you, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mmmm hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Last call that Coonan made was to a New York land line. Because of the damage to the SIM it’s missing the last two digits of the phone number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that’s ninety-nine possibilities, we’d better get dialling. Ryan, I’m looking at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We know the numbers are all from the same phone tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s where it gets interesting. They all trace back to the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s an Irish street thug doing talking to the FBI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>JOHNNY VONG</speaker><content>My program is idiot-proof. Look at me, I never went to college, I learn English…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett, the FBI agent's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Isn’t that DVD supposed to be booked in as possible evidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah yeah, but you know… I thought there might be something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I appreciate you coming down, Agent Forrest. Most of your FBI colleagues would expect the locals to come to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>AGENT FORREST</speaker><content>Most of my colleagues worry about hair products and press conferenceS when they should be out catching bad men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I take it you’re not from around these parts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>No sir, I’m not. But for my many sins the Bureau has transferred me here to New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you come into contact with Jack Coonan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>He reached out to us about a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you signed him on as an informant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>'Cause all there were, were overtures. And I wasn’t about to trade the family cow for a bunch of magic beans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t trust him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>When a case like Coonan reaches out to the Bureau, it’s usually because he’s crossed his bosses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he’s hard up to trade them in to the Bureau for a quick trip in to the waiting arms of Witsec .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was Coonan offering up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>Never found out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, whoever it was must have gotten wind of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then killed Coonan before he had a chance to deliver them to the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>FORREST</speaker><content>The Westies are a bit like the rogue state of Iran and the great state of Texas. They’re not too shy in handing out the death penalty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And talking to the FBI is definitely a capital offense. We need to talk to Finn Rourke again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>FINN ROURKE</speaker><content>An angel visited Jacky’s home two nights ago. Same angels that took the pharaoh's first born. Now I know some of you think you don’t know the angel of death. But trust me, lads, he knows you. So here’s to darling Jacky. He’s up in heaven now, you can be sure; he broke in when they was in Vespers.  Come to honour the dead, I hope? If not, I’ll thank you to move away out of this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re lying. You know exactly what happened to Jack Coonan. That once-over that you gave Trucho was just a piece of theatre to throw them all off, just like your eulogy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>Now you be careful, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or what? You’ll kill me just like you killed Coonan after he went to the feds about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>Enough! I’ll not have you slander him like this, not tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I got it straight from the FBI. Jack reached out to them just before he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He turned on you didn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>You don’t know what you’re talking about, boyo. Jacky Coonan was loyal to his last breath, he died in a state of grace. Even if what you say is true you can be sure Jacky wasn’t talking to the cheese about any of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How can you be so sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>You’ve heard of me. You’ve heard I’m a gangster, and a thief, surely you’ve heard I’ve killed men. But you answer me this, Detective. Have you ever heard Finn Rourke running drugs? Someone was bringing it in here, into my neighbourhood, my back yard. I sent Jacky to find the bastards behind it. Find them and punish them, according to our rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only they punished him instead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ROURKE</speaker><content>Aye, that they did. Now if you’ve got probable cause I suggest you arrest me now. If not, I’ll remind you this is a private party and I’ll thank you to get the hell out of my place. Another.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Give her a minute, Castle, she can’t just follow us out; it would be too obvious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You noticed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m a homicide detective. If there’s one thing I know how to spot, it’s a lady looking to unburden herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s looking for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No no no, don’t honk, Deep Throat, you’ll spook her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>MOLLY DEARING</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Molly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi Molly, I’m Kate. Can we maybe give you a lift somewhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>MOLLY</speaker><content>Anywhere but here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>MOLLY</speaker><content>Of course I knew Jack’s reputation. It’s part of what attracted me to him. What? You telling me you never had a thing for bad boys, Kate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Jack never mentioned going to the FBI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>MOLLY</speaker><content>Jack never discussed business. But I knew he wanted out. We talked about going somewhere far away. Last week Jack warned me he might get there first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jack saw this coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MOLLY</speaker><content>We spent every night together, he couldn’t get to sleep without me next to him. But last week he wouldn’t even let me come over. Anybody but Jack and I’d have thought he had something going on the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That never crossed your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MOLLY</speaker><content>This is the last thing Jack ever gave me. On the last night I ever spent with him. Jack said if things broke bad he wanted me to give this to the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And how do you know it’s to a bus locker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s always to a bus locker. TSA tore most of them out but a few terminals still have them, and this one is the closest to Coonan’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, no no wait, don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, once you open it we’ll know. Could be an alien corpse in there, Ark of the Covenant, or…  Johnny Vong DVDs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You gotta be kidding me. This is what Coonan wanted to give to the Feds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hold on.  No, this is. Heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was so cool just now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it was very Miami Vice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Coonan wasn’t going to the Feds to rat out his Westie pals; he was looking to rat out the drug dealer Finn Rourke sent him to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And the dealer flips the script, knifes Coonan before he can close the deal with the Feds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then we find the dealer and we find the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These boxes say the DVDs were packaged in Hong Kong. Someone must be slipping the heroin in before they ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means someone on this end knew which boxes contained the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And which boxes contained the secret path to financial independence. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It had to be someone in Johnny Vong’s organisation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>JOHNNY VONG</speaker><content>Yeah… I don’t care if you a bus boy. I don’t care if you wear the green apron and serve fancy coffee to a jerk talking on his bluetoof. I was like you once. Then I discovered the one secret that changed my whole life. Who out there is ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Place reminds me of my second wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Ah ha, yeah. Who is ready to close escrow on a new life? Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t even think about taking them off. If you do I will pepper spray you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr Vong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr Vong, I’m Detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD. I’d like to ask you a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Sure, sure sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe one of your employees was smuggling heroin into the country using your supply chain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Smuggle what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you mind if we looked in your…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Heroin trafficking, that’s good for a ten-year prison bid. Though I don’t blame you for running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>This is all a big mistake. I never do drugs. Drugs are for losers, I’m a business man. I try to help people achieve their goals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So long as their goals are to blow three hundred bucks on your bogus real estate system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>No. Listen, I offer you thirty-day money-back guarantee. If you don’t start building wealth by then I refund all your money, no questions asked. Would I make that offer if this was some kind of scam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Man has a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You don’t think he…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, here’s the deal. I’m not a dope cop, I’m a homicide detective, so usually I don’t even bother with your type of operation, but my problem and yours is the fact that you had Jack Coonan killed in order to hide your heroin smuggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Wait. Jack Coonan is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, careful there, Johnny, your accent’s starting to fade a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Look, I didn’t come over on a boat, OK, I’ve never even been to Laos. I’m from Danville, California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And this whole Johnny Vong thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>No one wants to buy a real estate system from a Harvard MBA. But show them an idiot with a Rolls Royce and they’ll knock down doors. So I play Johnny Vong, people want all that Horatio Alger crap - so that’s what I give them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that and heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How exactly did you know Jack Coonan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Look, whatever you think you know, I promise you I didn’t kill Coonan. You have to believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do I? Nothing about you is real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>No I… I needed money to take the program national. He needed a way to get product into the country. It was stupid but once you make a deal with the devil you belong to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who do you belong to? Who are you working for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>He’ll kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>You can’t; nobody can. You don’t know what he’s capable of. You don’t believe me, ask Jack Coonan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Mr Vong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>No. I’ll take my chances in prison. I’d rather lose ten years of my life than all of it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoever he’s working for scares him a lot more than prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There has to be a way to get it out of him. We could force him to watch Paris Hilton videos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want be brought up on charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Lanie, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s about the Coonan case. This is Dr Clark Murray. He’s a forensic pathologist. I asked him to consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m Detective Kate Beckett, this is Richard Castle, the novelist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ve met.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>DR CLARK MURRAY</speaker><content>Note the rectangular bruising around these wounds. Here and here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>MURRAY</speaker><content>Caused by the hilt of the knife striking with force enough to compress the skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And as a result the injuries penetrate deeper than the actual length of the blade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>MURRAY</speaker><content>He’s also honed the blade so fine it’s brittle enough for bits to break when it strikes bone. Which is why slivers of blade were found inside both of his victims. We now know that those slivers come from the same murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, two victims? How many people has he killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Five that we know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we're looking at a serial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>MURRAY</speaker><content>Well, yes and no. We believe we're dealing with a professional. Someone with extensive military training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A contract killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>MURRAY</speaker><content>I used homographic reconstruction of Coonan’s wounds to generate a 3D model of the blade used. It’s a special operations group knife, the kind favoured by special forces in Gulf War One. He kills with a single blow, using these other wounds to camouflage the skill with which the initial stroke was delivered. The very same method and the very same weapon that the killer employed ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>MURRAY</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, there is no doubt in my mind that Jack Coonan was killed by the same man who murdered your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am the investigator of record on this case. You had no right to withhold evidence from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, what did you expect? The last time Castle tried to talk to you about your mother's murder you bit his head off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I noticed the wound similarity. I reached out to Dr Murray. I held off from telling you until I knew the evidence was rock solid. Beckett, we came to you the moment we were sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett. Can I have a word with you?  Poor man's pain killer. I know your mother's murder was the reason you became a cop. And I know how you almost lost yourself trying to solve her case the first time you tried. I figured sooner or later when you were ready, you’d want to take another run at it. I just never expected her killer to come around and sucker punch you like this. Kate, listen to me. You’re the finest homicide I’ve ever trained, bar none, and I want you to stay on this one if you can, if you’re up to it; but I wouldn’t be doing my job as your captain if I didn’t ask. Can you handle this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry sir, I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett. Kate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>JIM BECKETT</speaker><content>Katie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>So what have you found?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>But enough to scare you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>I didn’t sleep well that whole first year after you got out of the academy. I’d hear sirens in the night and imagine you off in the darkness some place. I had nightmares where it swallowed you whole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dad, I don’t want to lose this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Your mother always said that life never delivers anything that we can’t handle; she lived by that. Called it 'Johanna’s immutable law of the universe.' And for years I thought she was wrong because I couldn’t handle losing her. Now I can almost hear her whisper, 'I told you so.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Four of Mom's favourite words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Look, she was a devout believer in the truth, and if she were here right now she’d tell you the truth can never hurt you. Now this may be your mother's way of reaching out to you, Katie, and reminding you that the truth is still your weapon to wield, not theirs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Leftovers in the fridge, upstairs if you need us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please. I will do anything that you need, including nothing, if that’s what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What I want is to find my mother's killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then, we need to break Johnny Vong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So let's break him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I owe you an apology, Mr Vong. Apparently in my haste I forgot to read you your Miranda rights. You’re free to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>No, I remember distinctly you read them to me. And I waived them all. You did. She did, you remember, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry, man, it’s a rookie mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>What? No, wait, you can’t, you can’t do this. If I walk out of here now he’ll think I’m co-operating with the cops. I’ll be dead by morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, you will. Or you can tell me who you’re working for and I will protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Dick Coonan. I work for Dick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re telling me Jack Coonan’s brother is the drug trafficker?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>He comes off like Jimmy Carter, but it was a scam to funnel money to the warlords with the poppy fields. Sure, he’d build a few schools, so he had pictures for his donors, but most of the money funded his cartel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he had access to all the dope he wanted; he just needed a way of getting it into the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>You couldn’t get an aspirin from Kabul to New York without somebody knowing about it, since 9/11. All I had to let him do was package the drugs at my factory in Hong Kong. He’d pick up the dirty shipments once they’d cleared customs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he had the Latin Kings put it on the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Perfect system; well, perfect until Trucho caught a case of the stupid and started selling in the Westies' territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then that’s what brought Jack sniffing around. Jack threatened to give him to the feds unless he quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Dick killed his own brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Oh, no. Jack had been with the Westies a long time, he’d grown eyes in the back of his head. Dick hired a professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>He called him Rathborne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do I find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>VONG</speaker><content>Ask Dick Coonan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>So any progress on the son of a ***** who killed my brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're close. We think that Jack was killed after Rourke asked him to hunt down a drug dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turns out the Westies have done a pretty good job with the war on drugs these days. Talk about zero tolerance. The punishment for dealing drugs in their neighbourhood is death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But when he tracked down this dealer, for some reason Jack didn’t have the heart to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>That is so Jacky. He always led with his chin. Went through life like he expected to win the good sportsman award on trophy night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cut the crap, Coonan. We know all about your heroin triangle. Afghanistan, Hong Kong, New York. And we also know that you hired an assassin named Rathborne to kill your brother before he went to the feds about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Prove it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ten years since we came home and found that detective waiting for us. Ten years since we crossed that yellow tape and went into that alley and every time I cross the tape at a crime scene I think of that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s what makes you such a good cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What if I let her down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know why I chose you as my inspiration for Nikki Heat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because you’re tall. Now go in there and do your job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have forensic accountants digging through your organisation, Mr Coonan. If there’s evidence of heroin trafficking, they will find it. But that’s not your biggest problem right now. Hiring an assassin like Rathborne shows premeditation, and that makes this a special circumstance case, which qualifies you for the needle. Now -- I am willing to take the special circumstance allegations off the table -- if you give me Rathborne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>The only special circumstance here, detective, is your complete lack of evidence against me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have Johnny Vong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>The guy with the phoney accent, and the real estate scam. Is that the best you can do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you really willing to bet your life that Vong can’t hold his mud, Mr Coonan? Give me the killer and I will put the DA in the mood for a second degree plea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>When we first met, you told me you’d been on the other side of this, remember? Now could that be why you seem so eager to get your hands on this mysterious assassin? Because if I had to guess, I’d say that someone close to you was murdered and you think Rathborne had something to do with it. But I don’t have to guess, do I? Because it’s all over your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That still doesn’t change the fact that you’re guilty of murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Maybe not, but for the low low price of transactional immunity, I can give you the closure you’ve been seeking. You get Rathborne and I walk. And that, Detective, is my final offer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Transactional immunity, Paul, and I’m inclined to give it to him. Rathborne has killed five that we know of, including the mother of one of my people. It’s one of our own, Paul. Now, I remember that used to mean something in this town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He went for it. District Attorney is going to offer Coonan immunity if he gives us Rathborne. I hope you know what the hell you’re doing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Describe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>About my height, just so average he’s almost invisible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>We were in the service together. They said he’d been killed back in a training exercise in '95, but then about a year ago I’m sitting at a bar and I glance across and I’m looking at a ghost. Turns out he’d been recruited back then, not killed, to do -- you know, the bad stuff that governments like to deny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How’d you hire him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>He’d given me the number to his answering service in the Caymans and they provided me with a single-use email address, numbered account. Emailed him the name of his target, wired him the money, and waited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, here’s the deal. You’re going to contact Rathborne with a contract on Vong. You are going to tell him that the police are taking him to the DA's office for a deposition and that he can’t make it there alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>It doesn’t work like that. He wants his money up front. It’s a hundred grand, non-negotiable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A hundred grand. The city is never going to agree to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Look, you want to catch her killer. The price is a hundred grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t just shoot that kind of money out into space without a hope of getting it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can’t -- I can. This one’s on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do we have a deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>As soon as Rathborne takes the job, your part is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>And I walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you walk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rathborne has taken the bait. Now for today’s performance the role of Johnny Vong will be played by Officer Clayton Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>OFFICER CLAYTON LEE</speaker><content>We who are about to die salute you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan and Esposito will escort Lee to the DA's office via a prearranged route. We’ll have plainclothes in place on every corner and mid-block and there will also be air support, for what it’s worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not a whole lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one even knows what Rathborne looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Well, he shouldn’t be too hard to spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, he’ll be the one who’s trying to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>All right, let's go, everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Be advised we are south-bound Lafayette approaching Worth.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We are through the intersection. Continuing east-bound Worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a solid plan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Disregard, disregard; it’s not him. We must have spooked him. Rathborne didn’t show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I let her down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rathborne’s in the wind, Dick Coonan’s about to walk. I missed something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could have been me. Rathborne could have checked the routing number and realised the money was coming from my account, not Dick’s. I was arrogant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn’t think you were arrogant, Castle, I thought what you did was sweet and I will pay you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Negative, Ghost Rider; small price to pay for a shot at your mother's killer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Coonan said it was a hundred grand to catch her killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you never told him it was your mother that was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There was no Rathborne -- that was just a cover.  It was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-32"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>Clever girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’ll never happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-34"><speaker>COONAN</speaker><content>You make a sound, you attempt to signal, you so much as clear your throat and I’ll put a round in this man’s liver and he will die slowly and in considerable pain.</content></utterance>
