<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Kate. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop saying ‘what’ and wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t …  We’re handcuffed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kinky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, it’s not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn’t say funny, I said kinky. And I didn’t cuff us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think I cuffed us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, they look like police cuffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somebody else did this to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But if I were writing a book, this is where bad things would happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My watch is missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mine too. And my wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So is my badge and my gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And my phone. I just renewed my contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you stop joking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Do I begrudge you your coping mechanisms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s the last thing you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  It’s kind of a blur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Me too. I think we were drugged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I think so, too. And not the good kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, lift my top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you still might be under the influence, but okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, not like that. Just check my back. There’s something that hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a needle mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We were drugged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like the work of a pygmy with a blowgun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, you can put my shirt down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, Castle. I want you to think very hard. What’s the last thing you remember from this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was with you. We were, uh … someplace seedy. A hotel that rents rooms by the hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you just knock it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s where we were. You called me and you asked me to meet you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then I took you up to the room and then we …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then we …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dead body! We went to go see a dead body!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. A dead body.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what I love about working with you? You always take me to the most charming places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m a simple girl, Castle. I go where the bodies are. Besides, for a mystery novelist, aren’t seedy motels kind of a standard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, yes. As a matter of fact, they’re a veritable advent calendar of salaciousness. Behind every door a delightful tale of desperation, depravity…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>You need to stop being a control freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m not being a control freak!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You are being a control freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I have never been a control freak. Nobody has ever called me -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry. Are we interrupting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No.  Victim’s a white male, late 30s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Housekeeping found him when they came to clean the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not entirely sure yet, but there are indications of asphyxia with some cyanosis around the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was suffocated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Maybe. Then again, there’s this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he could have just OD’d, passed out face first, and suffocated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh no, it’s definitely murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How can you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Someone torched his fingers.  Burned off his prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They wanted to erase his identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and did a pretty good job, too. His wallet’s missing and we’ve been through the room a couple of times. There’s nothing here to tell us who this guy is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he pay for the room in cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. And the clerk said that he registered as Jack Sparrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there’s a possibility that’s his real name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sure it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re running it … just … in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The clerk also said he appeared nervous when he checked in. He uh, kept looking behind him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he have any visitors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He couldn’t say. Place isn’t the most secure building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw a camera in the lobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a dummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> It’s not the only one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> It’s used to scare away drug dealers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, um…. You don’t go to the trouble of trying to erase someone’s identity unless you have a very good reason to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what are the chances of us recovering some of the prints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Depends on how bad the burns are. Let me get him back to the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, in the meantime, let’s get Ryan to run his photos through missing persons and see if anything pops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>John Doe in a seedy motel with his fingerprints burned off. How did we get from there to here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy. Easy there. Well, I hate to state the obvious, but we’re kind of joined at the hip here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s just stand up. C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you always like this in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, this is awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They couldn’t just handcuff us Midnight Run style?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Ryan did run our guy through missing persons. And there wasn’t a match. Then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then … Ryan asked me … if he spent Thanksgiving at his parent’s house did that mean he had to spend Christmas at Jenny’s family’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m talking about our case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you want me to reconstruct it I have to do it in order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Um … burnt fingerprints, suffocated, uh … needle marks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The morgue. We went to the morgue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I told you, it’s none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course it’s none of my business, that’s why I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Know what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What she and Esposito were fighting about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No ID yet, but his hands have calluses, so most likely he had a job that required physical labor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about fingerprints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Outer skin is too damaged.  But, I may be able to macerate the skin, pull some from the underside of the epidural layer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes. In some cases. But it’s going to take a couple of days. In the meantime, I did find this. It was tucked in the fold of his pants pocket. It would have been real easy for our killer to miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>147 West 97th Street, 4PM.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>It’s the address of the Canbury Café, half block off Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>4PM he was meeting someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or met someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, you and Esposito take this up there and see if anyone remembers seeing our victim. Maybe that’ll help us ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was so special about our victim that our killer wanted to erase his identity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t say spy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or mob hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mob hit of a spy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Crazy theories aren’t going to help. Not until we figure out who this guy is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is a postal barcode. Our victim wrote this on the back of an envelope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A postal barcode?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, those little hash marks you see on mailing labels and envelopes. It’s a way of exactly identifying an address, but in a machine readable way. We get that decoded and we’ll be able to tell exactly where our victim was when he wrote that note.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, then we called the post office and they gave us the address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The house in Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The house in Queens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So do you know what Lanie and Esposito were fighting about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Everything. They both want to be together, but neither of them wants to admit to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ugh … why do people do that to themselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe they just don’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could they not? It’s just so obvious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It matches the address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It doesn’t look like anybody's home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? NYPD, anybody here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anybody here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bill and Nora Ranford.  Maybe Bill is our John Doe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, identify yourself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>RUTH</speaker><content>Help me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ma’am … ma’am, are you okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An old woman in a cage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the last thing I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too.  What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s just, I always spend Christmas with my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, well… you were the one who decided to get hitched, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but I didn’t think that meant driving down to Florida to spend the holidays with her grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Driving? You’re not flying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>During the holidays? Are you kidding me? Besides, Jenny thinks that a road trip will give us some quality time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That is no road trip, brother. That is a relationship test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Relationship test? We’re getting married in a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, we’ll see what happens after the test. It’s the pre-wedding road trip test. Locked together, for hours. That way she can confront you with any lingering doubts she may have about your future together. And you will have nowhere to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Hey, have either of you seen Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s probably following up on a lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Don’t think that I don’t know that you guys cover for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh… what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Any progress on our John Doe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Turns out he did show up at the Canbury Café yesterday and he wasn’t alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Waitress recognized immediately. Said he sat in a corner booth, met with a guy, long hair, goatee. Said our vic looked nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We have the waitress working with an artist to see if we can come up with a sketch of the goateed man to use on a canvass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right. Keep me apprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>C’mon, Jenny loves me. She wouldn’t test me like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right. Just watch out if she wants to take you canoeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Canoeing? Canoeing is a test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s all about power, direction. Like a marriage. If the canoe goes straight, it shows her that you can compromise, work together, find a rhythm, move forward in the same direction. But, if it’s going around in circles? So is your relationship.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, would you just work with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How about you work with me? How come you always have to lead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How come you always have to step on my toes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since when do I – okay, you know what? Tell me this. Why do you always have to be first? First out of the elevator, first through the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, I am a cop. I’m the one with the gun. Being first through the door is my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In the elevator? Look, how ‘bout this? Would it kill you to let someone open the door for you once in a while?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do realize that if somebody opens the door for me then I will be going through it first anyway, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah, that’s right, I forgot. You have to be the smartest, too. Everything’s a competition with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is so not true. Are you always like this in the mornings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I’d argue with you but then I’d have to let you win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Go ahead. You lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.  Where did you want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think that there is a light switch over there. Or do you want to stay in the dark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I liked it better in the dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This door is sealed. There’s no way we’re getting through here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The walls are cinder block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you suppose is in that big freezer? You think it’s the old woman? And what if we’re in some psycho’s lair and we have to kill each other like in Saw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, stop speculating. It’s not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, c’mon. An old lady in a cage? Us cuffed together in this creepy room? What am I supposed to think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re supposed to think we need to get the hell out of here before someone comes back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long do you think we were out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A couple of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘Cause I’m hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve got some beef jerky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hold my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that the cuffs don’t cut into us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We could just try to get them off. You got a bobby pin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is this, the 1940s? These are my police cuffs. You’re not gonna open them with bobby pin. Face it. We’re stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think anyone knows we’re missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha and Alexis will notice if you don’t go home, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, my mother is taking Alexis on a tour of colleges this weekend. Esposito and Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, they’ll probably notice, but it doesn’t mean they’ll –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- find us here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a hatch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If we can up get there we might be able to get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s too high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if we climb on top of that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That was Lanie. Preliminary autopsy report shows that our victim was in fact smothered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guy his size, you think he’d put up more of a struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He couldn’t. Tox report showed that his system was flooded with so much sedative that it could put down an elephant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where are we with that sketch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I’ve got unis looking through mug books and I sent a team up town to canvass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Still not back, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. It’s been hours. Every time I call it goes straight to voicemail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think they’re really running down a lead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What lead? There was nothing new on the board when we came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You think you can hit up dispatch? See if they’ll run a trace on the transponder on Beckett’s unit. I want to know where they are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t get a good angle on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here. Try this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You better not be enjoying this, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll let you know in a minute. One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Push.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever is in here is a hell of a lot heavier than a little old lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s like it’s filled with rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if we emptied it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a great idea, Castle, except it’s locked and I’m fresh out of bolt cutters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s a combo lock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, when I was writing Storm Rising I studied with one of the best safe crackers in the biz. I can open this. I just don’t know if we want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s get crackin’, Castle. Before our captors get back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Transponder says her unit’s right over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s definitely Beckett’s car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like it’s been dumped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Call it in.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Time stamp puts this at 5 hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But that’s not Castle or Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And he’s not alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Someone picked him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do we know who they are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Can we get a plate number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Too far away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We also ran Beckett and Castle’s cells. They’re both off grid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What the hell did Castle get her into?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I want CSU on that car with a fine tooth comb for any possible trace evidence. They were working the John Doe with you. Where could they have gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Been over it a dozen times, we still don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Still no hits on our long haired man from the café.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do whatever it takes to get an ID on that victim. And find out what in the hell he was into. If Beckett and Castle are still out there, then they’re running out of time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, for God’s sake Castle, how much longer are you going to keep doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ugh, I almost had it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, like you had it the last 100 times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ye of little faith.  You would make a terrible conjoined twin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can I have my hand back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you got a story to explain all of this? The old woman in a cage? John Doe with his identity removed? Us handcuffed but still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t think that’s a story you want to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With those elements? I can’t think of a version that ends well. Not even a Disney version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I was afraid of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The good news is, we’ve been gone long enough they’ve started to look for us by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>101st time’s a charm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon, Lanie. There’s got to be something else about this guy from his autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He was in the beginning stages of heart disease, he had a degenerative hip condition, and mild scoliosis, probably from sitting too much.  And the last thing he had to eat was a pastrami sandwich. None of which will get you an ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His hands were calloused suggesting physical labor and yet he spent too much time sitting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Maybe he drove a fork lift. I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon! We need something concrete, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Then I can’t help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie, they’re out there! God knows where and what kind of trouble they’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You don’t think I want to help? They’re my friends, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Beckett said, with enough time, you might be able to recover prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, in a couple of days. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What happens if you do it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>If could damage the print beyond recognition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Could. So … it’s possible it might not, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We gotta do something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You did it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How bad can it be? I mean, we’ve seen dead bodies before, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not a body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. It’s worse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Manacles and bloody instruments of torture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, looks like your crazed, sadistic, psycho killer theory might not be far off, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know whether to be smug or horrified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I vote for motivated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right there with you. Let’s get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I can feel your impatience all over my backside. And rushing me is never a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re talking about that print, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It tore. I guess the skin wasn’t softened enough. It’s ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is any of it usable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I might be able to salvage some of it from the middle. Why?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what we did, we were able to join the partials from that scrap of paper with the print pieces that Lanie recovered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our victim is Hank Spooner, an independent trucker out of San Antonio. Owns and operates his own rig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What was he doing in New York?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to his folks, he got a contract last week to pick up a load from Del Rio, Texas and bring it to Queens. Last they heard from him was two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What was the cargo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All Spooner told them was that he got a last minute call from a special client who was paying him big money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His folks also said it was unusual for him to be staying in a motel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Apparently Spooner never stayed in the city. He thought it was safer and cheaper to stay in his truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We need to find that vehicle. Get an APB out to all the major truck stops. If we’re lucky it may tell us why someone wanted Hank Spooner dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CHUCK MARTINEZ</speaker><content>I think I might be able to answer that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>You looking for me?  Chuck Martinez, DEA.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>How did you know we were looking for you, Agent Martinez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>We had Spooner’s files tagged. He’s a person of interest, so I got notified when you ran his prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why did you meet with him yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Your man’s dead, Agent Martinez. And two of my folks are missing. We don’t have time for jurisdictional games, so I’ll ask you again. What’s your interest in Spooner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>All right. Look, half a dozen times a year Spooner takes a contract from Texas to New York, but he always makes a pickup in Del Rio. It’s a little border town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You think he’s smuggling drugs from Mexico?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Cartels are really active in these towns. They’re extremely brutal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And if you knew Spooner was involved, why didn’t you arrest him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>All the signs were there, okay? But all we had him on was suspicious activity, and we don’t want the errand boy. We want the people he works for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>How’d you end up at that café?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Needed some leverage. So we set up a sting posing as runner looking to hire him to move some product, only Spooner made my guy. Now, instead of running, he wanted to meet. And he was scared. He wanted out and he was afraid of what they would do to him if he walked away. So he agreed to tell us everything if I guaranteed him safety and I took that to my bosses. They agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>But by then he was already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>So where were your colleagues when they went missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We don’t know. We just know they were one the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did Spooner say anything to you about the New York operation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>All he said was, it’s not at all what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Troopers found his semi. Truck stop, north of the city.  Let’s go, boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>STATE TROOPER MCNICHOLS</speaker><content>According to truck stop records, the rig’s been parked here for three days. No one’s seen the driver for two. You’re going to want to take a look inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s hair. These could be air holes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey! Over here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s still too high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if I climb on your shoulders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? We’ve done it before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you say that like it was pleasant. And we weren’t handcuffed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s got no faith now? C’mon, Castle. We’ve got no idea when they’re coming back or even if they’re coming back at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last time you were wearing sneakers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lift up my shirt, pull off my boots … now, under normal circumstances I would like where this was heading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can fantasize later, after we get out of the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just so you know, not as much fun if I have your permission.  How do you run in these things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shut up and pull.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Agent Martinez, are you sure these guys were smuggling drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Ah, if I had answers I’d share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What did you find?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Spooner delivered to a furniture store in lower Manhattan two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Get on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Call your bosses. Tell them I want all the files on this investigation. I’m getting my people back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! … okay, can you put me down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we ever get out of here we should seriously consider joining the circus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me try it from behind, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. I’m game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not so fun as I would have thought.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s open! Okay, I think I can pull myself up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! Let us out of here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you want from us?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Captain Gates! Store owner verified he took a delivery from Spooner a couple of days ago, but he said it was just a couple of coffee tables packed near the rear of the truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And you believed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s a family man, didn’t have any priors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But he did say something happened during delivery. Something weird. As they were unloading the shipment, a box fell off a stack and hit him in the shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He said the box must have been empty because it bounced right off of him. He tried to joke with Spooner, asked him if he was shipping cotton candy or air, but Spooner kind of got squirrelly. Said it was just a couple of empties there packed there to fill some space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He thought it wasn’t a big deal but then he heard something from behind the boxes. Something that sounded like breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So Spooner takes a few small legitimate jobs in order to justify his smuggling trips and places a wall of empties in front of whatever his real cargo is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Did the owner have any idea where Spooner was headed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Beckett and Castle were on to something. Where in the hell did they go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the only thing we had at the time was this address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And we were already covering it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ah … they must have seen or heard something that you didn’t. Okay, I want you guys to –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Mine? No, I was thinking about yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My hand? Why my hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s smaller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> They’re coming.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, someone else is in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re holding someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The old woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No … it’s more like a girl. Like …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like they’re trying to sell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s human trafficking, that’s what this is. Abducting and selling people. That’s why we’re still alive. They’re not going to kill us. They’re going to sell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? I’m a bestselling author. I wonder what I’d be worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s not find out, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, still.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>From the cut marks, it looks like this hatch was just installed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. CSU’s going to sweep for prints and trace. What did the neighbors say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That the bank foreclosed on the previous owners, Bill and Nora Ranford, 6 months ago. But a couple weeks ago, new neighbors moved in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get an ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh uh. Kept a low profile. But neighbors think there were two of them, brothers, and they got an ID on their ride. Black F-150.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A black F-150? That means Beckett and Castle were here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not only that, but a couple of nights ago a guy from across the street says he hears some noises in the middle of the night so he goes to the window and sees a semi pulling up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Spooner was here, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmhmm. Whatever was going on, this was the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why don’t you wake up the registrar? See who bought the property. I want to know who these guys are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? Can you hear us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I can hear somebody breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe she’s sedated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? Can you hear us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This wall is stucco tile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, the others are all cinderblock. If we start digging we might be able to break through and help her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is getting out of one prison and into another going to help any of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, let me ask you this. If it were Alexis on the other side, what would you do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.  The moment you hear. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Negative on prints from the house. The place was wiped. What did you get from the registrar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, the house was foreclosed on five months ago. It’s still owned by National Bank. Our guys must have been squatting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you say National Bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The files Agent Martinez sent over.  Spooner made a delivery to a Brooklyn house two months ago. A couple of days later the Feds raided the place, but by then whoever was in the house was gone. All they found was a hatch cut into the floor that accessed the basement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sounds familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. And when they traced the property it was bank owned. By National Bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Our guys must be targeting distressed properties to run their operations from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, get a list of all the National Bank owned properties in the New York area, starting with the properties that have a basement. If they’re working off the National Bank foreclosure list, that might be where they’re finding their safe houses.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that should do it. Switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, shift over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Together. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve always liked your legs, but now I respect them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, yours aren’t so bad, either. You know, for the next police picnic we should do the three legged race together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you hear us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess you want to go in first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t mind if I do.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A tiger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a tiger. And it almost bit my face off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well you know, that explains the case and the chains and the butcher knives for the raw meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A tiger. That’s what they were haggling over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, tigers are endangered. Trafficking them is illegal. We walked in on their operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, walking in on their operation is not our problem right now. That tiger walking in here is our problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Castle. She’s not going to get through that wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Get back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it just me or does she look a little bit hungry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just gonna … buy us some good will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no! Castle, Don’t go near her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s going for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and when she’s done with that she’ll want more.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>National Bank has close to a hundred properties in foreclosure in the outer boroughs but our folks have certain needs, so we filtered out all the ones without basements.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Two houses we know they used had other common elements – close freeway access, long, wide driveways that can fit a semi, and both were situated between empty lots or unoccupied houses minimizing the nosy neighbor factor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="53-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I believe this is yours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="53-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And lucky for all of us, some of my detectives keep me informed as to their whereabouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thanks to you two, I’m instituting a new policy in our department. No one goes anywhere without calling it in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="53-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, at least we won’t have to look so hard the next time we save your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I missed you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Prove it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="53-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How’s that tiger? Was it grrr-reat?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="54"><utterance uid="54-1"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Her name is Ruth Spurloch and it turns out her sons were major suppliers of endangered tigers to wealthy customers all around the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hard to believe that’s worth killing for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-3"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>The exotic animal trade is a million dollar industry. Texas, which has almost no regulations, is one of the few places in the world where selling and breeding tigers isn’t illegal. Ruth and her boys were making millions off her breeding farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Spooner would truck them from Del Rio up to New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then wealthy clients would smuggle them past customs and ship them out on their private jets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-6"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Right. Except outside of Texas, trafficking endangered species is a criminal offense, so Ruth didn’t want Spooner rattin' her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why when we showed up at her house she played the victim so she could get the drop on us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, and knocked us out using animal tranquilizers. Which can’t be good for me. I still have a taste in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-9"><speaker>MARTINEZ</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, I’m – I’m going to turn the trafficking case over to the FBI and Customs. You can coordinate with them on your murder charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thank you, Agent Martinez. I’ll walk you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. As expected, the hair from the truck is tiger and the blood is from raw meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They used the hatches to throw down food to the cats or sedate them with darts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s going to happen with that tiger, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shoot ‘em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’ll get transferred to a sanctuary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably end up in a zoo. Why, you want to go visit her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No thanks, I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, you guys. Get some rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That has got to be the strangest brush with death that I’ve ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too. But I’ll tell ya. After that experience, if I ever have to be hitched to someone, it would be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hitched?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hitched? No, I didn’t say hitched. I said cuffed. Handcuffed, not hitched, the colloquial or any connotation or meaning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s okay, Castle. I understood what you meant. And for what it’s worth, if I have to spend another night handcuffed to someone again, I wouldn’t mind if it was you, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But next time, let’s do it without the tiger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Next time?</content></utterance>
