<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Ashley? I mean, shouldn’t I tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Darling, in matters of the heart it’s best not to overthink things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s your advice, Mother? With your track record?  What chasm of doom has she led you to with her tips on romance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>As it happens, we were discussing secret admirer etiquette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have a secret admirer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I always thought it was silly but now I’m kind of intrigued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And there is no need to tell Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How exactly does a secret admirer express his … admiration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He left a note in my locker.  ‘As you walk down the hall, a shard of sunlight glanced off your rope of flaxen hair and set it aglow. And I was enchanted.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so poetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I figure the rope of flaxen hair is my French braid, which I only wore after gym glass, which means he saw me in the hall on the first floor between fourth and fifth period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Narrowing down the suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? You can’t do that. No, you … no, that’ll ruin the secret. No, it’s like a mystery novel. You don’t just go to the last page, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do?  Well, you shouldn’t. It’s not … you can’t… the joy doesn’t come in knowing who did it. The joy comes in the journey. In allowing the ending to blossom, like some magnificent Himalayan blue poppy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, okay.  I’ll let him stay secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mark my words. You’ll thank me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>So our victim is Linda Russo. She’s a customer relations worker at a cable company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe someone was unsatisfied with their service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I was thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were?  Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sanitation workers found her body under a couple of boxes. She lives two blocks away, over at 24th and 10th. Looks like she was on her way home. Hey, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … it’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she just … looks so peaceful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>There’s nothing peaceful about what put her here. She was strangled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With rope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So it appears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, do you have a theory that you would like to share with the class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s just that … pretty blonde girl, strangled, laid out like she was asleep …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was four years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but he was never caught. This is his MO and she is certainly his type. I researched him for When It Comes To Slaughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah? Well then, you should know that he killed his victims inside their apartments, not in alleyways. And he posed them in a funeral pose with their hands clasped in front of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Maybe he’s switching up his act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or this could just be a crime of opportunity where a young woman was murdered.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Russo, did your daughter ever talk to you about being followed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you think of anyone that might have wanted to harm her? Any relationship problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At the cable company, right?  Did she have any issues with anyone there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was his name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That was quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>911 has that effect on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’d you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I pulled all the files on all his past murders, just like you asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I … I believe that was my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah. But I only listen when it comes from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, you were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He choked them. Using a three strand twisted quarter inch rope. Based on the fibers embedded in the skin, we know that the rope is green and white nylon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Those details were never made public. Now check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The marks are identical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I found the exact same green and white fibers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is him. The Triple Killer is back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>For those of you living in a cave, four years ago the Triple Killer, or 3XK, got his nickname by strangling three women in a week, dropping out of sight for a month, then killing three more. Then he disappeared. I served on the task force that investigated those six murders. An FBI profile is the closest we came to identifying the suspect. Feds say he’s a white male, twenty five to forty five years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Could be me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>With a dysfunctional relationship with his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Still me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>With a menial, unimportant job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Definitely you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just for that, I base my next book on Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He’d learn their habits, then gain access to their apartments by disguising himself as a security guard or a repairman, and then he strangled them. And he posed their bodies as if they were lying in a coffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you think that is all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably reenacting some terrible early trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Two final points. The Triple Killer seems to be back after four years. There must be a reason. Maybe he just got out of prison. Or returned to town. He may have altered his MO, but let’s assume that he’s working under the same clock – three murders, one week. Based on Linda Russo’s time of death we’re already into day three. Let’s move on this, people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. That perv the mom told us about? Linda’s colleagues knew who he was right away. Paul McCardle. He works at her office as a horticultural technician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, he’s the guy that waters the plants, dusts the fake ficus, or at least he was until he quit yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s interesting timing. I see domestic complaints by the double digits …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Filed by his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ex-wife. They were divorced last month after being married for four years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So in a way, he did just get out of prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It gets even better. Linda’s neighbors said they remember a red Sentra parked outside her apartment a few days ago. Same vehicle McCardle has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s get him in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>So what’s this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Linda Russo. Where were you two nights ago between six and midnight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>Uh… I was bowling with some buddies at Galaxy Lanes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why did you decide to abandon your career as a horticultural technician?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>I … I just wanted to move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because you used that job to watch Linda, to stalk her, and once she was dead, why stick around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>That is not true. I’m innocent here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you don’t look innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, as a matter of fact, you give new meaning to the phrase ‘sweating a suspect’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, I perspire a lot. Okay? I have a medical condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that’s the least of your problems, Mr. McCardle. Your fixation with Linda Russo was well known, as was your history of violence against women. Your car was seen outside of her apartment and now she’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>I never touched her. I had a thing for Linda. Okay? I had a thing for Linda and I parked out in front of her place. But I haven’t been anywhere near there in three days, okay? Not since that guy threatened me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>MCCARDLE</speaker><content>I got rousted by some security guy and … and he told me to move on. And it really freaked me out and I haven’t been back there since. I swear. That’s the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So Sweaty von Sweats-a-lot? His alibi is holding. The manager of Galaxy Lanes has him throwing gutter balls from five until close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the security guard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan checked into that. Turns out, there’s only one building on Linda’s block that uses guards. According to the security company, no incident report was ever filed against McCardle or his vehicle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So McCardle was lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe not. You know, in the past, the Triple Killer posed as a security guard. Maybe our guard wasn’t a guard after all. Maybe he was the Triple Killer moving McCardle off of his turf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, whoever he is, he’s sticking to his schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We have a second victim.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Her name’s Kim Foster. Twenty eight. An interior designer. Same rope marks on her neck, same everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did she die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Uh, based on liver temp, I’d say sometime last night. Probably early evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Neighbors saw a gas repairman leave at seven forty-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No doorman on the building, so Triple Killer calls Kim Foster on the intercom, says he wants to check a gas leak, she buzzes him in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me check the incoming caller IDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t get it. Why did he return to the old MO?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nostalgia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He killed Linda Russo in an alley. She didn’t have a doorman either. Why didn’t he just kill her in her apartment like all the others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, maybe she was special somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vic’s last incoming call was at seven thirty-five from the front door. She must have let him in and boom, he just overpowered her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it wasn’t that easy. Look at those throw pillows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s wrong with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Kim Foster’s an interior designer. These pillows have been arranged with a barbarian-like gracelessness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like a man would do it. So she put up a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Struggled right here on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he reset the pillows to cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s out of practice, so he’s not so neat …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Found a penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Under the circumstances, is this still lucky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait … I think I found something, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vince. Think it belonged to the killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe it’s been here for weeks. I’m going to have to get CSU to process this area.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sir? A Mr. Townsend wants a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Bring him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Cal. Good to see you. How’s Marie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CAL TOWNSEND</speaker><content>Uh… she’s okay.  We’re split up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TOWNSEND</speaker><content>Um… reporters. They keep coming to my door and asking how I feel about… the man who killed my daughter might be on the loose again, and you know… After Sarah died, and all through the investigation, you were always straight with me and I just need to know, you know? I mean, what they’re saying … is it true? I mean, is he back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yes.  Cal, we’ve got leads. We’ve got good leads. We’re doing all we can to chase him down. If we make an arrest, you’ll be the first to know. I promise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>TOWNSEND</speaker><content>Sarah would have been twenty nine next week.  Don’t let him do this to another family.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. There’s no news from CSU on the nametag. Not that I was expecting any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Makes you wonder why he didn’t pull that whole gas leak routine on Linda Russo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know why. The answer’s in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A transcript?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From four years ago. I took a look at calls made to the Triple Killer tip line and this one stood out for me. It’s from May 21st, 2006, which was a week after the sixth murder. A woman called and left a message, but she was too afraid to leave her name. But she did mention that she lived at 24th and 10th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Same corner as Linda Russo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was riding an elevator with a cable repairman who so creeped her out that she got off floor early just to get away from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but cable guy and creepy? That’s a job requirement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except he wasn’t a cable guy. She said he wasn’t carrying the right tools.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And working for a cable company, Linda Russo would know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why I took a look at Linda Russo’s phone records from four years ago. She’s the one that made the call to that tip line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Linda Russo was special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When she got off a floor early he knew that she made him, so he dropped out of sight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which also explains why he attacked her outside. He knew there was no way she would let him into her apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Linda Russo saw his face and he came back four years later. That’s a special kind of ruthlessness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. CSU just got a partial on that nametag. We got a match.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The man that we’re looking for is Marcus Gates. Forty two, six foot tall, one hundred and eighty pounds, with light brown hair. He also has a snake tattoo running down his left arm. A print match ties him to Kim Foster’s murder. Now a prison psych evaluation calls Gates a brutal, highly intelligent sociopath. He’s done time for manslaughter and attempted murder. His last conviction was for breaking a bottle over a man’s head, almost killing him, for which Gates served four years in Sing Sing. He just got out last month. No known address, no family. His mother died when he was four years old and he was placed in a series of foster homes since then, so he will not be easy to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Listen, four years ago, this guy took the lives of six women because we didn’t stop him. We know who the Triple Killer is, we know he’s out there targeting his third victim. Let’s get him before he gets her.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Must be quite a case if it’s keeping you out this late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you know. Someone died, someone else did it.  Secret admirer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Figure out who it was yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I took your advice and decided it’s better not knowing. And he left another note in my locker. He said if I liked the rose I should show him by wearing it at school tomorrow. Isn’t that sweet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … is that a good idea? What would your boyfriend Ashley think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I get a feeling that it’s not Ashley who has a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m … just not sure it’s smart to go wearing a flower when you don’t know who it’s from.  Your school isn’t exactly Fort Knox, all right? Anyone could have put that note in your locker. Your secret admirer could be some … pervert watching you from afar with high powered binoculars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m going to bed now.  Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Night. Could you lock your windows for me, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please?  I’m going to check, make sure they’re locked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, I had it all set up. It was in this pile, over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re messing up my system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey guys. Any news on Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>My system is efficient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I already went through this with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s on this stack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s part of my system!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your system is dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. We tracked down an uncle in Jersey but he hasn’t seen Gates in twenty years, so I’m on the phone with Sing Sing to chase down prison associates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>PRISON OFFICER</speaker><content> Detective Beckett, you still there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, I’m still here.  Okay. And is he still doing time?  First time drug offender. Got it, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jelly Tyson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Jerry, Castle.  When Gates got released he gave all his stuff to Jerry Tyson, a fellow inmate. So if the two of them were friends, Jerry might be able to tell us where we can find Gates.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>JERRY TYSON</speaker><content>I have three months left in this hellhole. All I want to do is do my time, get out, and go see my girl. And it’s never going to happen if Gates gets wind that I talked to cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>You don’t know that! He’s got reach in here. He’ll have me taken out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here’s the deal, Jerry. Whether you talk to us or not, I’m willing to sit here all day. So it’s going to look like you were spilling your guts to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>All right, but I want to be back in my cell in two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fair enough. Were the two of you friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>I guess. Whatever that means in here.  I work in the kitchen. I snuck him food so he could make pruno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And in return he agreed to protect you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content> And now he’s gone and I’m in here going it alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Every con I’ve ever known dreams of what he’ll do and where he’ll go once he gets out. Gates ever talk to you about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>I remember him talking about some strip clubs and … um… there’s a place he liked to go drinking. Um … in the meat packing district.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was it called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Hog something. Something about Hog.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>How many are in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Five total. Gates, the bartender, waitress, and two drunks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He may be armed. We’ll take him quick, don’t give him a chance to get any hostages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s him! Let me see your hands!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah man! Put your hands in the air, and why don’t you get on your knees while you’re at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Wow. Brought out the old guy, huh? Can only mean one thing. You want me in a bad way, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Hey, don’t forget to read me my rights. Be a shame to get turned loose on a technicality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cold, implacable … the Triple Killer remains at ease, calm in the lair of his enemy with a resting heart rate of fifty. Set to match wits with his interrogators.  I … just wanted to bring a literary flair to the moment … you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The bartender told us where Gates lives. He’s had to put him in a cab on more than one occasion. Ryan’s got a warrant and he’s searching his place right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We can’t count on circumstantial evidence to carry this case. We’ve got to get this guy to run his mouth. Only hard evidence we have on him is Kim Foster’s murder. Pin him down on where he was when she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Castle. Not this time.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Gates, I’m Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Not my type. But … I would make an exception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Do you know a Kim Foster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Doesn’t ring a bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you ever seen this woman before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mmm… she has nice hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you or haven’t you seen her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Uh… New York City is a big place. I could have passed her on the street, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m actually talking about a more intimate interaction. Have you ever been in her apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ve been to a lot of apartments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This building is at 35th and 8th.  She lived in 301. Were you ever in that particular unit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, perhaps you can explain to me how we found this nametag with your fingerprint on it lying next to her body. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> As a matter of fact, I can.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can’t wait to hear this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I work at the Empire Prop House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And they rent props for movies and TV shows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know what a prop house is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So that’s my job. I stock props. Tons of nametags, just like this one. I bet I’ve touched a hundred of them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Run that down, see if he’s for real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s no record of you having this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>They pay me under the table.  Oh. Maybe you can get me for tax evasion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This prop house where you say you work, do they have uniforms there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like gas company uniforms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Any kind of uniform you can think of, they’ve got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And have you ever taken any of these uniforms home? Do you have any in your possession?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Are you guys searching my place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. So if there are any uniforms there you may as well tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Wow. I’m going to want to see the search warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It’s my legal right. And I’m done talking ‘til you show it to me.  So you better get with affirmative action back there and come up with a new game plan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wants to see the search warrant to get a peek at our cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is that giving him a peek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The warrant lists ropes, uniforms, and other personal effects belonging to Kim Foster, Linda Russo, and the other six Triple Killer victims. By looking at the warrant he can gauge where we are in our investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not giving him a peek, that’s showing him our whole hand. He’ll know we think he’s the Triple Killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He already knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Empire Prop confirmed that Gates works in their warehouse and had access to those tags. He clocked out at seven oh-two the night of Kim Foster’s murder. Now, Empire is in Lincoln Square, which means that he had enough time to get to her apartment and push the intercom button by seven thirty-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Show him the warrant. Odds are he will lawyer up, but try to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How’s she supposed to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I don’t think she can.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Turns out you got a lot more on your mind than just Kim Foster. I see the names of seven other women in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Tell me you’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not so far. No rope, no uniform … nothing that ties him to any of the victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Keep looking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thing is, this nametag is probable cause for bringing me in. But I’ve explained the fingerprint and by now I’m sure you’ve checked out my story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we’re still verifying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I know how this works. You do not have probable cause to hold me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that right? Can we hold him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Only in the movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he can just walk out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Unless she catches him in a lie and gives us cause to keep him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I want to leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. You can do that. The second you lawyer up and leave, you become the focus of a major investigation. It will disrupt your life in ways you can’t even imagine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’m already the focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well you don’t have to be.  Look, the truth is we don’t have any evidence to connect you to those murders. It all boils down to Kim Foster. Even if your fingerprints got on this nametag by accident, with your record you still looks like a suspect to us. So Kim Foster’s a problem for you. But you can get that problem out of your way. You said you’ve never been to her apartment. Where were you at seven thirty-five last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What’s in that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If your alibi checks out, we move on. We go after the real killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I left work at seven, I walked home, like I always do. I got home maybe seven thirty and I stayed in all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you’re sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is off a security camera across from Gates’ apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, this is it. This will prove that he was lying. At seven thirty-five he was on his way to Kim Foster’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, woah, woah. Stop, stop, there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That’s him. Seven thirty-one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, that can’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It is. Look. Same sideburns and there’s the snake tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, he slipped out the back and went to Kim’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How would he get to 101st to Midtown and change clothes in … four minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but he did it. Can we enhance this video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You can enhance it all you want but it doesn’t change the facts. We gotta cut him loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I don’t like this any more than you, Detective. But he alibis out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it looks like we had it all wrong. You’re free to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>With this Triple Killer fella running around, you all better keep your loved ones close. Sure hope you catch him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put a surveillance detail on him. I don’t want that son of a ***** out of our sight.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don’t you look adorable this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I meet my secret admirer today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASLTE</speaker><content>Oh, I can just picture the scene. You and your secret admirer agree to meet in the cafeteria. You scan the array of pimply faces; which one is his? Your secret admirer uses the prearranged signal of a double helping of mashed potatoes on his plate. He’s handsome. Charming in an asexual, nonthreatening kind of way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Nice try. But it will be so much more mysterious. Listen to this.  “If you want to meet, I’ll be at Strawberry Fields at five o’clock. I hope you’ll be there, too.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … no, no, no. No, you’re not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Before you were practically forcing me to find out who it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not in the park. Not by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But I’ve been there a million times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. The first note you got. Rope of flaxen hair? Rope? Flaxen? Flaxen is blonde.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I’m a redhead. You’re totally overreacting. I’m meeting my secret admirer and that’s all there is to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, darling, she’s right. You are being utterly irrational. It’s like when I was doing Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and I thought my understudy was trying to poison me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah, the daily blood tests I paid for. Wait, she did poison you. The Swiss chocolate she gave you was a laxative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ahh… it added a certain urgency to my performance. But, the point is, you indulged my paranoia. So therefore, I am going to be in the park, five o’clock, at a discreet distance to make sure that Alexis’ secret admirer is not an axe murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me you’ve arrested Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not even close. I mean, I don’t know how, Castle, but he killed Kim Foster. And he’s going to do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s been no developments? Usually you call me with news.  You called to seek my counsel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t say it exactly like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no. You were hoping I had some wild theory… some sort of penetrating insight that would lead us to a breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well? Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Nah, I got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just need some piece of evidence. I mean, someone that he talked to. Anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if Gates confided in Jerry about the previous murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, Jerry’s not going to talk to us. He got beaten up in the prison yard this morning and he thinks that Gates had something to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like Gates is afraid of what Jerry Tyson knows.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Get the hell away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, Jerry. We just need a little more information on Marcus Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Don’t you guys get it? I’m a dead man, thanks to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if we get you out. The DA has agreed to get you an early release and police protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Gates knows about my girlfriend, Donna Gallagher. He can get to her, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then we’ll make sure he doesn’t.  We’ve gotta move on this, Jerry. Last chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll do it. I’ll take the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to know. Did Gates ever talk to you about attacking women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>There was this one time, he told me about this chick, um … Sarah, down in SoHo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That could be Sarah Townsend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>He told me about how he busted into her place and things got out of control. But it must have been pretty bad, ‘cause Gates said he was worried that the cops were after him, so he busts a bottle over this guy’s head to get himself locked up, that way he’d be under the radar for awhile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a good start.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>My name’s Detective Ryan and I’m your new best friend. This motel’s under surveillance. For your own safety you cannot leave or use the phone. Right now, you and I need to go over everything Gates ever said to you, even if it seems stupid or unimportant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Jerry’s story squares with the facts. Sarah Townsend was Gates’ sixth victim and she lives in SoHo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about assault with a deadly bottle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It fits, too. It came a week after Sarah’s death. Looks like Gates sent himself up the river on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s still not enough to arrest him, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>No, but it Jerry has more tidbits like that it may help us get there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We can’t locate Donna Gallagher and she’s not picking up her cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, where is Gates now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>At his apartment. Surveillance says he hasn’t left the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Contact Donna’s friends and family, find out where she is. I told Jerry we’d keep her safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Can’t you just arrest this guy? I mean, you know he did these things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He has an alibi. We can’t put him at the murder scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>He used partners sometimes. You know that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Partner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We never ran across anything about a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. He said a partner helps him get away with things. Though I get the idea he never used the same partner twice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jerry said Gates used a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A partner. That’s why he has an alibi. Tell your guys to arrest Gates. I know how he killed Kim Foster.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gates said he walks home every night at the same time, right? So this traffic cam footage from the day before – wait! There he is, there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s Gates on the right the night of Kim Foster’s murder. On the left, Gates from a night earlier. What’s wrong with this picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT_ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s too short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So either Gates shrank …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>… or this is his partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wore Gates’ clothing. He would have access to wigs and disguises from the prop house. That’s how Gates can be in two places at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait … what’s that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … it’s a reflection from … from sweat! From sweat! That’s Sweaty von Sweats-a-lot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Paul McCardle. That’s why he was watching Linda Russo. He’s the partner. He was working with Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m gonna put an APB out on McCardle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You better add Marcus Gates to that list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>When officers busted into his place all they found was a rope ladder going down to the rooftop of the building next door. Gates is gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Got uniforms searching the area. No sign of Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he’s going after Donna. That way he could punish Jerry, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We got any leads on her whereabouts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito’s talking to her friends right now, but she’s still in the wind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So is Paul McCardle. His car is gone and his ex-wife has no idea where he is, either. But, I did find out how he and Gates are connected. They were in a foster home together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So McCardle could be with Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Get photos of McCardle and Gates to airports, bus and train stations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>One of Donna’s neighbors just told me she’s house sitting at her cousin’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but so does Gates. Some guy dressed as a messenger said he had a delivery for Donna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get there now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get off her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Like to see you talk your way out of this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ll try not to disappoint you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found the same kind of rope in your pocket as was used by the Triple Killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Last I checked, man’s allowed to carry rope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you wanted to get caught, Marcus. There’s nothing left for you out here, but in prison? People fear you. You’re a shot caller and you wanted to be king again. All that’s left for you to do is clear the air of all these murders and be done with it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Nice try.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>This guy’s never going to give it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I need leverage and I don’t have any. There’s no witnesses, there’s no proof that connects him to the murders. The only thing that I’ve got him on is an assault charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, we just got a hit on McCardle’s APB. He’s at St. Benjamin’s Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Gates got to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, if I can get McCardle to roll …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh … um… if… I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay Castle, go. Just stay out of his way. And Ryan? Get me something I can break him with.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m Detective Ryan. We’d like a word with Mr. McCardle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>You can’t have one. He just got out of heart surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>Uh… congenital valve defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would that cause excessive sweating, by any chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>Well, among other more serious symptoms. He’s been in dire need of surgery for over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why get it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>He finally came up with the money. It’s kind of a costly procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How costly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>About uh … hundred thousand dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And who footed the bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>That’s confidential information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You spoke to his ex-wife. She didn’t even know he was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She hated the guy. So who sent the flowers?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>McCardle’s surgery had nothing to do with Gates. In fact, Gates sent him get well flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he cares about his foster brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s your leverage. You still need us to wait and talk to McCardle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Tell Jerry his girlfriend’s fine and he doesn’t have to worry about Gates anymore.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You keep coming back for more. I look for that in a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found Paul. He’s at St. Benjamin’s. We know that he pretended to be you the night of Kim Foster’s murder and I’m going to get him to testify against you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You don’t know Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then we’ll go another way. I’ll charge him with accessory to murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> You can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we can. Sing Sing might have been a picnic for you but how long do you think Paul is going to survive in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Paul didn’t know what was going on. He only did what I told him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only way to prove that is by telling me the whole story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Only if Paul gets immunity. And I want that in writing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>CAL</speaker><content>That’s him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That’s him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Gates, did you kill Kim Foster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Yes. I killed all of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I want their names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Linda Russo. Before that, it was Sarah Townsend. Five other women.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gates confessed to everything.  You get to chalk one up for the good guys. Why the long face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because if this were a book, I still wouldn’t understand the operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Valve replacement. It’s no big deal. My dad had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s is if you don’t have the money. Who paid for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m guessing Gates did. Maybe he stashed away some money from before prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but he was out of prison for a month. Why wait ‘til now to do McCardle’s operation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well … he needed McCardle to help him with Linda Russo and Kim Foster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Packing up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-10"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Oh, just getting stuff together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All that stuff from prison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-12"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Ah, you accumulate a lot of stuff, you know, even in the slammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You were right about Gates. He did try to go after Donna. But she’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-14"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>And Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He confessed. It’s all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-16"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aren’t you going to ask what happened?  To your girlfriend, Donna. You didn’t ask about her. You just asked about Gates. Doesn’t make any sense, unless …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was supposed to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-19"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>I … I don’t know what you …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And McCardle didn’t get the money for the surgery until after you got out of prison.  He’s removing all evidence he was even there. It was him all along. He’s the real Triple Killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-21"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Guilty as charged.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Excellent work, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir. And I hope you say the same to Castle. Where is he, by the way? I thought that they would be back by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Maybe he and Ryan went out for a cold one. After a day like today, that’s what I’m doing. You care to join me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Let’s hit it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That story about Gates getting arrested; that was your story, wasn’t it? You were afraid you were going to get caught, so you hid in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Too bad you didn’t figure that out sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Too bad you didn’t leave sooner. Cops’ll be here any minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Looks like Detective Ryan called the precinct just before you got here. There won’t be anyone missing me for awhile. By the time they do, I’ll be long gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You won’t get far. They already know your name, your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>I can change those. Done that before. That’s part of the fun of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fun like setting up Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-8"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Paul McCardle was the only person in the world that he cared about. Once I learned that, the rest was easy.  You never know when you’ll need one of these. Besides, Gates liked prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You taught Gates everything he needed to know to take the fall for the Triple Killer murders. After that all you had to do was pay for Paul’s surgery and you can walk away scot free. That’s a beautiful plan. Undone by a duffle bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-10"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Not undone. I’m right here. I’ll relocate, start over. It must eat you alive knowing you came so close to catching me, but this is a winner take all type of game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Jerry. Shooting? It’s not your style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-12"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Oh, you really don’t know me at all, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not complicated. You were raised by a single mother. She was blonde. Oh, she was beautiful, but … she never wanted you. When you were what, twelve, I’m guessing, she died suddenly. Let’s say drug overdose. You go into foster care, the bad kind. You have so much hate, so much hate towards your mother for abandoning you that you kill these women to get back at her. But you leave them looking peaceful because as much as you hated your mother, you loved your mother. Am I getting warm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-14"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>You’re drawn to death. You like to be around it because it thrills you. Now where does that come from? Your own suppressed impulses? How close to death do you want to get? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-15"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Don’t say anything you shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, I just wanted you to know, your conspiracy theories are completely unfounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My conspiracy theories?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh huh. Alexis’s secret admirer is Ashley. Her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, and he’s a very charming young man, so anyway, all’s well that ends well.  Richard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-23"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think there’s anything more to say.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="48"><utterance uid="48-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s clear. He’s gone. I’m fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> No, I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. What the hell happened here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m so glad that you’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s the Triple Killer. He set Gates up to be a copycat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know. I did the math when you and Ryan didn’t come back from talking to Jerry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you know to come here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your mom called. She said you told her that you loved her and she figured something must be terribly wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I figured she might.  Good girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="49"><utterance uid="49-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.  Tell me something, Castle. Why did he let you live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To punish me. Make me pay for ruining his plan. Now he’s going to kill again, all because I couldn’t stop him. And I feel so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know the feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-7"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
