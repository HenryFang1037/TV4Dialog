<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Keep the perimeter at a three block radius, and keep the press the hell out of here. We don't need a panic on our hands, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Sir, radiation teams have finished sweeping immediate area. Negative across the board. If they moved the device, it's not nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Makes no sense. Why would they move it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>It's a rodeo clown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Rodeo clown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>The truck. It's a diversion. Jamal must have sensed we were closing in. He gave us something to chase, throw us off the target. He's playing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So, we're back to square one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>We got to find Jamal, move in on his employees, shake the trees. Somebody's got to know something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you think Fallon knows he's chasing a dead man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. And he won't know unless we get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Think they're coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For Jamal. Why else would they keep his body on ice? Whoever's behind this wanted to preserve his body for some reason. I'm thinking they wanted his body in that van with the bomb. That way, when the bomb goes off...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They got his remains and his DNA at the crime scene. People would think that he was the terrorist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. And then the real terrorists would get away scot-free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. So then, the question is why. What is their agenda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We're not going to find out in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle, thank you for stating the obvious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Got anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. No thermostat, no control box. Must be on the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Got any bars on your phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh... No. Wait, wait, wait. No. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How cold do you think it is in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, judging by the way that it feels, I'd say it's well below freezing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long do you think we're going to last dressed like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A couple of hours at the most.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's what I thought, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wha-- that door's made of steel. I don't-- I don't think that's gonna do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, nobody knows. That we're in here. Nobody even knows to look for us. We're gonna freeze to death if we don't get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well maybe there's another way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. On three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, again. One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Again. One.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We didn't have to come back. I was fine, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Fine? I could literally feel your anxiety level rising the further we got from the city. A spiritual retreat is supposed to be spiritual, darling, not stressful. We'll do it another time when you don't have a test hanging over you. Although, I could have written you a brilliant excuse. I used to write the best ones for your father. Circus accidents, apartment fires. Movie night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don't know. He has the projector up, but...huh. He's not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, maybe he's out. As in...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, ew. But he always calls when he's "out" or leaves a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, he figured we were gone. So, why bother? It's late, darling. Come on. We'll ask him in the morning.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, that's not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Stand back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just stand back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ho! oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Are you trying to kill us sooner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe just save a few rounds for in case they come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I could use a silver lining right about now, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Um... I wish I had one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This doesn't make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, bro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>These guys who work for Jamal's moving company. They are Middle Eastern, but most of them are citizens born here in the states. Aside from a couple of traffic violations, their records are clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe that's why they were recruited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Now you're starting to sound like Fallon. You know, maybe Castle was right. Maybe there is something else going on here.  Ryan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You get anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nothing so far. They claim to not know anything about Jamal's whereabouts or his activities. The ones that are lawyering up are accusing us of racial profiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>They're not wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Compared to a nuke, a dirty bomb is a fairly crude device. It's designed to instill fear in a populace. The majority of the immediate damage is gonna come from the conventional explosion, creating a kill zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Like Oklahoma City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Except for, it's not just a building that falls. It spreads radiation for several blocks. That's your secondary kill zone. If left untreated, people can die from radiation poisoning in less than a week. But what makes this such an effective terror weapon is the outer zone. You know, in this area, everybody seems fine at first. Then the cancer starts showing up. Babies, kids, adults. And with every new case that's reported, people flock to the emergency rooms, overwhelm the system. It's like we're being attacked all over again. If we can't find the bomb, maybe we can find the target. Pull everybody you got. Give me a list of every significant event going on in the city for the next 48 hours. Any place where people might gather in large numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>This is New York City, there are a hundred events going on every day. We have to narrow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Focus on anything political or government related. There any sporting events going on, what's happening at the U.N. Maybe there's a reason they're choosing to strike now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sir, can I speak with you alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Excuse us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So, what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I just got off the phone with Castle's daughter. Apparently, he hasn't come home and she hasn't been able to reach him on his cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle got kicked off the task force. Why isn't he at home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>How should I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Beckett's not answering her phone either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We thought, given their history, that...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We thought the two of them might have got on to something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You two do realize that a terrorist cell is threatening to strike and thousands of lives may be at risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, sir, but--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What do you want me to do? Send out a search party because your pals aren't answering their cell phones in the middle of the night? For all I know, they could be out having a cold one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I appreciate your concern, and I'm sure they appreciate your concern, but they can take care of themselves. Besides, we have a terrorist to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Are you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm right-- I'm right--I'm right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can't feel anything. Huh. I always thought, being a cop, I'd take a bullet. Never thought I'd freeze to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. W--we're not dead yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just wish this was one of your books and you could re-write the ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm s-- I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>F-- for being me. Going rogue. Getting you into-- into this. If we hadn't gone-- gone rogue...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, shh. Castle, no. Okay? Shhh. You were right. We found the bomb. We were just too late, okay? Castle. Thank you...for being there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just want you to know how much I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Kate. Stay with me. Kate. Stay with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>DISTORTED VOICE</speaker><content>Castle? Beckett?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>PARAMEDIC</speaker><content>Easy, pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett. Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>PARAMEDIC</speaker><content>Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>She's gonna be fine. You're both fine. Got to you just in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Josh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>Hey. So, you're recovering from a moderate case of hypothermia and you're going to be a little bit sluggish for a while. But, with some warmth and some fluids, you should be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought you were in Haiti.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>Didn't go. It's gonna hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>Okay. Let's see if we can't get you to sit up. All right, move slowly. There we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long was I out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>Oh, well, about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Searched the entire warehouse. It's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How'd you find us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, Alexis called. Said you didn't come home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis? She's supposed to be out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I guess she came back. We figured you were with Beckett, until Josh called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We thought you must be out there doing something incredibly stupid against orders. So, we sent patrol units everywhere we figured you'd be moronic enough to go. Found Beckett's car, searched the area till we found the light from the storage container.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I'm glad my stupidity is predictable. You pulled us out of there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Saw your boy's back in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. He came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what does that mean to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It means we have a chance. Come on. Fallon wants to debrief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's ready to believe us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>NEST confirms high levels of residual radiation along with a military grade Semtex. There is no question that device was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I'll have my team pull surveillance tape on every camera within a quarter mile of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Sounds good. I'll catch up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You two. You always this stubborn and insubordinate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only when we're trying to save the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>I'd be more impressed if you succeeded. How did you know to come here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Security cameras in Amir's cab. We think that he was keeping tabs on one of his drivers, Kevin McCann.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We pulled McCann's route records. Turns out he visited that storage facility in Washington heights where the radioactive material was being kept and this warehouse long before Amir did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>McCann was here before him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. It looks like Amir was following McCann, trying to figure out what he was up to, until he was caught and killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And with Amir, their intended patsy, dead, we think they were trying to implicate his cousin Jamal as the bomber. That's why they were keeping his body on ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Did you see any other members of the cell here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. It was dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And they were shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But we do know that the bomb is housed in a white commercial van with a rear-end side passenger door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-44"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>A white van in New York City. Well, that narrows it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We saw the counter. It's set to go off at four o'clock today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-46"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>That's less than ten hours from now. All right. I'll put up check points, if it's already in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I know all the evidence points to Amir and Jamal, but something bigger is going on here, and Kevin McCann is involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-48"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Got it.  Yo. That was the taxi company. McCann's supposed to be on shift right now, but he didn't show up, and he's not answering his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-49"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Did you get an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-50"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>DMV lists an apartment off Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-51"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>All right, get a team together. Go up there and get them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-52"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Agent Fallon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-53"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Given the circumstances, we'd like to request to be reinstated on the task force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-55"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Well, that's not up to me. It'd be up to your doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-56"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You know, it's funny, when I first met you two, I thought you were together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-57"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. No. Just-- just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-58"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Get cleaned up. We got a long day ahead of us. All right, guys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Richard, darling. Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you using that blanket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, no. I'm gonna give it to you. Oh, you poor baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You look like death warmed over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If someone tries to sell you on cryogenics, say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I knew you wouldn't turn your phone off without leaving me a message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now, is this about the cab driver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I need you girls to do something for me. But I don't want you to ask any questions. I want you to go to the Hamptons, I want you to stay there for the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, what is this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See, that...that's a question. Look, there might be a...an event...that will make it very dangerous to stay in the city. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Calling Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. You can't tell anybody, okay? You can't tell anybody. You tell Ashley, he'll tell his parents. They'll call someone they love, and...a panic will make this thing a thousand times harder to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, he's my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This isn't fair. You can't just--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fair has nothing to do with it. I need you to go. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>But you'll...come, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I will when I can. But I need you to go. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Figured you could use the caffeine. And the warmth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. You ever wonder about Fallon? I mean, what this must be like for him, living this every day? I told Alexis and my mother to get out of town. I didn't tell them why, but they knew. They wanted to tell their friends and I told them...they couldn't. I felt like a monster. I mean, that must be some kind of hell feeling that all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It kind of makes you wonder how many times this has happened since 9/11 and we were the ones who didn't know.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, the McCann address is a dead end. Korean family lives here. Been living here for the past four years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you search the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. But we did talk to a longtime neighbor, and they said the McCann family lived here, but it was over a decade ago. She seems to recall something about them having a son named Kevin, and he went in the military.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Kevin McCann. Army Special Forces. Recipient of two Purple Hearts and a Distinguished Service Medal during his six tours in Afghanistan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Six tours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Military's stretched pretty thin these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doesn't make any sense. What's a war hero doing mixed up in a terrorist plot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Don't look at me, pal. It's your theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do they have an address listed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Arlington, Virginia. Kevin McCann, the real Kevin McCann, died a couple of years back at a VA hospital from complications of wounds he suffered during combat ops. Buried at Arlington with full honors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, someone stole his identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>He could be anyone. Including a foreign agent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Run this through FBI and CIA facial recognition databases all the way up to Interpol. I want to learn everything we can about this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. So, Tech tracked the phone that he's been using under the McCann name. Patrol units just found it in a dumpster. It's been wiped clean. We got an APB out on him, and we sent copies of his photo to everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Teams are on their way to the taxi depot and the impound to pull prints from the cabs he drove, but with multiple drivers and passengers, there are going to be hundreds of prints in each cab. It's gonna take some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>It's time we don't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would he steal McCann's identity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>I thought this guy was a crime novelist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I-- I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Well, you should know that sometimes people who operate outside the law will take the social security number of a deceased individual and use it to forge a new identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. I've done it three times in my books. What I'm saying is, why would he steal Kevin McCann's identity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Because it was convenient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why was it convenient? I mean, the money that was deposited into Amir's account implicate him. We tracked it back to Afghanistan. McCann served in Afghanistan. Maybe there's a link.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>What kind of link?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe...maybe this guy wasn't just stealing the identity of some random dead guy. Maybe McCann is someone he knew. Or someone he needed to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Contact the Pentagon. Get everything you can on McCann.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>AGENT</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His family used to live here. Are they still around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His parents are dead, but he's got a sister in Queens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>Sorry about the mess. It's just-- it's been hard since Doug left. Sweetie, just go play in your room. So, what happened? My deadbeat ex got arrested again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, Miss McCann, we're here about your brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>Yeah, I know him. That's Radford. Radford Hayes. He was in my brother's unit. They were best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He assumed your brother's identity. Do you have any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How well did you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>Mostly from my brother's letters. They were in the VA together. He was there with me when...when Kevin died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>In his letters, did he ever display any animosity toward this country?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>Why is he asking me that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There's a possibility that Mr. Hayes is working with a set of extremists who are plotting against the U.S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Colleen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>Radford took me out for a beer after Kevin died, and he was angry. Angry at how everyone stopped caring about the war, like it wasn't even happening. Angry at the way politicians were treating soldiers like they were tissue paper to be used and thrown away. He thought the folks in Washington cared more about scoring political points than winning. He said that maybe what this country needed was another wake up call. Maybe next time we'd get it right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Do you know where we can find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>COLLEEN MCCANN</speaker><content>No. All I have is a cell phone number.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>HOMELAND SECURITY TECH</speaker><content>His phone's active, but it's old school. No native GPS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>How long before you get a fix on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>HOMELAND SECURITY TECH</speaker><content>I'll need a few minutes to triangulate off the cell towers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Do what you got to do, just don't let them know we're coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I can't believe we're chasing one of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's not wrong, you know. Used to be we go to war where everybody sacrifices, everybody pitches in. Now, you don't even see it on the news. I'm not defending him, I'm just saying I understand the anger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Amir is a perfect patsy. He has a background in weapons engineering, ties to Syria, which is a hotbed for Al Qaida recruiting. I mean, it has terrorist written all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the money from his Afghanistan account would have had people believing Taliban was involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're so programmed by fear. People are gonna believe exactly what Radford wants us to believe, that we were attacked again. And then they're going to cry out for blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>In less than four hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we can't stop it, shouldn't we tell people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Tell them what? That a dirty bomb is gonna go off somewhere in Manhattan? You know the kind of panic that would create? No. Our only hope is to stop this thing. Let's just hope that we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>We got him. Let's roll.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Get down ! Get down! Get down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get down, now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>On your knees! On your knees! Interlock your fingers behind your head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Tell me where it is. Where's the bomb? Where is it? Where's the bomb?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This guy makes me sick. He swore an oath to defend his country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In his mind, he's a patriot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm, like Tim McVeigh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Ryan, contact DOD. See if you can get 20s on the guys he served with in Afghanistan. See if any of them are blowing in the wind. You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>We break him no matter what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Look, I know you're angry, and I understand. But what you're doing, what you're involved with it's not the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Radford, you're a soldier. The people in this city are not your enemies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RADFORD HAYES</speaker><content>I have no idea what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we know about you going up to the storage facilities in Washington Heights and the warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RADFORD HAYES</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Well, we know that there was nuclear material in the storage facility. The bomb was assembled in the warehouse. So, don't insult us and tell us you don't know anything about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He's wasting his time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why do you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He's Special Forces. We're trained for this. Never to give up information. Never to give up your position if you're captured. He can't break him. Not in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Do you see yourself as a-- a great hero? Doing this for a-- a mighty cause? You think that's how people are going to see you? Because, I'll tell you right now, brother, if you let this happen, you're going to go down in history as America's greatest mass murderer. Is that what you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RADFORD HAYES</speaker><content>When this bomb goes off, do you think they're gonna be looking at me? People will see this as an act of terrorism. So they will be looking for a terrorist, not a patriot. Not one of their own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Is that what you think you are? A patriot? There is a word for people like you. It's not patriot. It's traitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>RADFORD HAYES</speaker><content>The powers that be have no use for a traitor. So, when they find their terrorist, and they will find their terrorist, what do you think will happen to me? Well, let me tell you, because I know them. I know how they think. I will become a footnote in one of your files, buried so far that no one will ever find it. Because anything more'd be an inconvenience to their self-serving rabblerousing narrative. So, why don't you do us all a favor and just accept the inevitable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You think this is a joke? You think I'm playing with you?! Where's the bomb?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Where's the bomb?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fallon! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Where is it? Where's the target, Radford?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lower your weapon, Fallon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Where's the target?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fallon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lower your weapon, now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Not until he tells me what I want to hear. Where is it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lower your weapon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You ready to go all the way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-25"><speaker>RADFORD HAYES</speaker><content>I'm prepared to die for my country. Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put down your weapon! Now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>He wasn't gonna break. If I had a couple of days, maybe. A week. But not in three hours. We needed him to break, I saw an opening, I took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You violated his rights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>I can think of probably a dozen federal lawyers that would disagree with that. He was never in any real danger. I removed the bullets from my clip. The gun wasn't even loaded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, mine was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I was pretty sure you weren't gonna shoot me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, next time I wouldn't be so sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Detective, I understand that you probably hate me. You have every right to. Both of you. But my job isn't to make friends. It's to stop bad things from happening. And, seeing as how we're just a couple of hours away from a major terrorist event, and we are basically back at square one, I could really use your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Man, does that guy take jackhole lessons, or was he born that way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Neither. I asked my buddy at DHS about him. Turns out his wife was killed on 9/11. She rode the second tower down. They were on the phone together when it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's right. If we don't get Radford to talk, we're dead in the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Okay, I need backpack detectors spread out to the ten most likely targets. Get the NES teams ready. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are we on Jamal and Amir's co-conspirators?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Co-conspirators?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? We know that they're patsies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Remember what Radford said about the bomb going off? He said we will find our terrorist. But, with Jamal and Amir out of the picture...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They're gonna try to pin it on someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Somebody related to them both. All right, get locations on all known associates of Amir and Jamal Alhabi. I don't care if we've dismissed them before. Anybody of Middle Eastern origin or descent. Nazihah, Amir's wife. Find her, track her down. See if she'll cooperate. She trusts you. Maybe she can help us narrow down the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's Fallon's surveillance guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nazihah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nazihah?! Nazihah?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's gone. So is the kid. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Found this on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Allah akbar. God is great. I go to my glory against the forces of the infidel." She's their new terrorist. They're gonna have her set off the bomb.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uniforms are canvassing the neighbors, but none of them saw the abduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the traffic cams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I got teams out there, but with less than two hours left, there's no time to go through all the footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where's Montgomery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He's on the phone with 1PP coordinating city emergency response teams just in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Mobilize FEMA with full radiation protocol. Have them standing by to airlift into the city. Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found her phone at the house. Family car is out in front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>So, we have no way to trace her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We got something. According to the DOD, most of the guys in Radford's unit are still deployed. I was able to locate all but two. Evan Bauer and Jack Cochran, their families say that they've been on fishing trip since last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we know about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Bauer is a weapons specialist and Cochran did a tour in explosive ordinance disposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Any EOD guy would know how to build a bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>All right, get a team together. Crawl up these guys' asses with a microscope. Phone records, financials, anything. Get a location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>We find these guys, you know what we're gonna see? Nothing. These aren't brainwashed radicalized kids on a student visa. This is highly trained military. They're probably reading out of our playbook. We are running out of time. Get NEST in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>AGENT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Maybe we'll get lucky, ground teams can make a move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There, um... There might be another way. But, uh, I don't think you're going to like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Make the call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>EVAN BAUER</speaker><content>It's really very simple. Do what we ask, everybody lives. Don't do what we ask, everybody dies. It's as easy as that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>NAZIHAH</speaker><content>You killed my husband. Why should I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>EVAN BAUER</speaker><content>Because I'm afraid you have no other choice. See the van? All you gotta do is drive it where we said, park it, and walk away. You do that for us, we'll return your baby and we can all go on with our lives. But you should know, there's a camera on the driver's side. If you do anything stupid, we'll know. Nod if you understand.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. Beckett. So good to see you again. And Agent Fallon, your reputation precedes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Does the Syrian Consulate even know you're here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>When last we met, Detective Beckett, you relieved me of my pistol. I thought now is a good time to retrieve it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Yusef, when we last met, you told me it was in your business to stay informed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>I find, in my business, it's important to keep up with current events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I'm sure that your country would do everything in its power to avoid a terrible misunderstanding if, somehow, Amir or his wife Nazihah were mistakenly believed to be involved in an act of domestic terrorism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>I would say it's in both our interests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You also mentioned that Amir was of special interest to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>We at the Syrian consulate wanted to make sure he liked his new home. So, yes. We checked in with him from time to time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about Nazihah? Did you check in on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>Under the circumstances, we thought it would be appropriate to send our condolences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>You had her under surveillance, didn't you? Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>FARIQ YUSEF</speaker><content>Mr. Fallon, the Syrian Consulate is strictly a diplomatic mission. Certainly not in the business of spying on U.S. citizens. However, if you were to happen by a red brick industrial building on the corner of 158th Street and Franklin, I do not think you'd be wasting your time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment outside the city.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I guess it's all up to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knows we're on a deadline, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I mean a literal deadline. As in, you go over the line, you're dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, can you just give him a chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I-- I'm happy to give him anything he needs. It's the clock that's not cooperating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Alert all units, target is in a black van. Repeat, a black van. They left for Times Square ten minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How'd you get them to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>I lied. I told them Radford cut a deal implicating them both.  I want checkpoints and barricades in Times Square!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Get choppers in the air! Find that van!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She just left ten minutes ago, there's a chance we can catch her in before she gets there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Take Broadway or Riverside!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got Broadway!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's the most direct route to Midtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it's not the fastest. We should cut over--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, would you please stop telling me how to drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm not telling you how to drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You are telling me how to drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nazihah's husband was a cabby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Broadway slows down in the 70s through Midtown. She would know that the fastest way is West End to 11th, and then cut cross-town on 48th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, why 48th and not 46th?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because 46th has construction on it. Turn here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>HELICOPTER</speaker><content>All units, this is 23, we're  a black van southbound on Broadway passing 22nd. I repeat, southbound on Broadway, passing 22nd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I, uh,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm turning around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, don't turn around! It's the wrong van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, how do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There! There, there, there, there, there! There!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's her.  Pull over. Nazihah, pull over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>NAZIHAH</speaker><content>Please, no! They have my baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nazihah, no. We've got her. She's okay. She's--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dispatch, this is One Lincoln Forty. We found the bomb on 55th and 11th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>DISPATCH</speaker><content>One Lincoln Forty, copy. Bomb squad is en route. ETA three minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dispatch, that's about two minutes too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>DISPATCH</speaker><content>One Lincoln Forty, stand by.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you should've seen his face. Because he stopped, he looked at me, he grabbed all the wires and then he just yanked them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I figured one of them had to be the right one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You know, the mayor wants to give you guys a medal. I don't have the heart to tell him you had no clue what you were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain's right. You guys don't know how lucky you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Can I talk to you two for a second? I just want you two to know the U.S. Attorney's Office is going to be charging them with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit terror. Thanks to you two, we won't have to add murder of innocent New Yorkers to that allegation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we were just doing our job. Actually, I was doing my job. I don't know what the hell he was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. But that's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Listen, um... what I do is not who I am. It's just how I have to be. I hope you both understand that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don't we just say, "It was a pleasure." And that we hope that we don't have to do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>AGENT MARK FALLON</speaker><content>Fair enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I--if it does happen again, though, maybe you could just text me. Have a code word. Run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hell of a day, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hell of a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I was thinking... I was thinking maybe-- I should go home. Get some rest. Long day. Goodnight.</content></utterance>
