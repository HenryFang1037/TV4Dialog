<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>What are you so excited about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the latest issue of SkyMall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh really, darling, who subscribes to SkyMall? Isn’t perusing all that dreck on the plane enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dreck? Mother, I will have you know this is the gateway to the hottest new inventions in the world. Where else can you find a remote control that has a bottle opener…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I think it’s Alexis’ decision letter from Stanford University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, kiddo. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s just makes it so real. She grew up so fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, what do you expect? Her to live here forever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, her, yes. You …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that the mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. You have one here from a Mr. Stan Ford. Is that anyone you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, darling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I – I didn’t get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh sweetie, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But I picked all my classes. I bought T-shirts. I had it all planned.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could Stanford think she’s not worthy? She’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Last week you didn’t want her to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but I didn’t not want her to get in. I was sure she would get in.  You got in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well … I wouldn’t now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, put your bruised ego aside. I’m sure she’s crushed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well actually, right now she’s in denial. When I left she was on the phone with Admissions explaining to them that they made a mistake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>That is an excellent question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean there’s no body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nope, just lots of blood. Whoever's it is, there’s no way they survived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where’d they go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You’re the one with all the crazy theories, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Walking dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>But there are indications that the body was moved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>I think I know who moved it. I’ve got witnesses that say they saw an unmarked white van fleeing the scene just after 7AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They get an eye on who was behind the wheel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but we’ve got unis canvassing for eyewitnesses and checking every street level security cam in a five block radius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tire tracks. Okay, get a cast of the tire treads. CSU might be able to get make and model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s two different sized footprints. There were at least two of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but there’s no tread on the footprints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Must’ve been wearing booties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Missing body, killers who literally cover their tracks … anyone else getting a quick strike assassin squad vibe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh c’mon Castle, you’re not saying it’s some type of black ops job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not saying it. The evidence is saying it. I’m betting this guy’s buried at sea by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, there’s an imprint in the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, it looks like a box or a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Might have been our victim's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nuclear launch codes, probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Ryan, there’s a pattern. Let’s see if CSU can ID it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, no, sorry. It’s just that word, pattern. Jenny and I, we’re still registering for the wedding. China, silverware, stemware, sheets, not to mention …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU imprint. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, I’m pretty sure I’ve got a cause of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean besides massive blood loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Gunshots. Neighbors heard a pair go off at 6:40 this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>6:40? You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, positive. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because Ryan’s witnesses saw a van racing out of here at 7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who would kill someone, wait for them to bleed out, then take their body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess that rules out “quick strike” assassin squad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN GATES</speaker><content>An imprint in the blood is your best lead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, based on stitching, CSU determined the briefcase was an Underwood, which is pricey, and only two local shops sell them. They’re giving us customer information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Sounds like a long shot at best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re waiting on tire tread analysis and Detective Ryan is overseeing the review of over fifty security cameras looking for that van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What about the victim? Any closer to an ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Based on blood Dr. Parish determined that our victim is a male, so we’re looking for missing persons reports of men in that area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Men. You’ve narrowed the victim pool down to men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, well … in New York City that actually eliminates over 4 million women, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I don’t know what the Mayor sees in you, but I know how you’re alike. He’s term limited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe if I sent her –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So an investigation without a body. That’s kind of new, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah … you know, there’ve been murder investigations where authorities haven’t found the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but in those cases they still know who the victim is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“Father of four disappears on fishing trip, blood found in family garage.” Where do you start when you don’t know who the victim is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You … I - … you know, you could …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We really need to find the body, don’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I may be able to help. Security cam footage near the alley clocked three vans that matched our witnesses' description, two Astros and an EconoLine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s the EconoLine. Tire tread analysis just came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got plates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, the EconoLine is registered to a PW Storage. It’s only six blocks from our crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The plates match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s in these things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Judging from the size of them, you almost expect there to be –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People! Geez. They’re people. They’re people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They look … frozen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell is this place?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who are they all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does anyone else have the sudden urge to run to the streets screaming ‘they’re here’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, this is Detective Beckett. I need every CSU tech –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Movement. Movement 10’o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turn around!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Killing and freezing people is your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cryonics. That explains the room of human popsicles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To be brought back to life in a science fiction future where death has a cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Think they can put me under until the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you know he was dead before we did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That explains the timeline problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Even if that’s true, what were you thinking, moving a shooting victim? Why didn't you call 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His brain isn’t alive, it’s dead. He’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>DR ARI WEISS</speaker><content>That’s a matter of opinion. Dr. Ari Weiss, CEO of Passageway. This is my attorney, Johnny Rosen. I imagine you have many questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. Starting with who’s the murder victim you took from my crime scene?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>His name is Lester Hamilton, a biology professor at Hudson University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Here, can you call it in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>He also happens to be an old friend. Marvin Medical School. It’s ironic he died so young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>He conducted cutting edge research in developing life extension techniques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not that it did him any good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he worked with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>No. Lester focused on how to extend life before death. I created Passageway in order to extend hope for future life. After death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You got any celebrities in here? Ted Williams? Jack Frost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>We don’t discuss our clients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you’re going to have to discuss this one. Lester Hamilton was murdered and my ME will be taking custody of his body as soon as she gets here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>ROSEN</speaker><content>Detective, our client, Professor Hamilton, has an iron clad agreement with Passageway to have his body cryo-preserved upon his death. Short of a court order, he’s not going anywhere. And any attempt to take him would constitute tortes interference and we would sue you and the NYPD into oblivion.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>DA won’t back us up on this one. They say that the case law is murky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll say it’s murky. A life extension researcher is killed, then a shadowy cryonics company absconds with the body? This has all the hallmarks of a vast and insidious conspiracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m still trying to figure out how to explain it to Gates.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>They steal our victim and then threaten to sue us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, it’s a legal chicken and egg problem. Since Hamilton’s body is on private property we can’t get it without a warrant, but it’s going to be tough to get a warrant because without the body we can’t even prove he was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You get that double speak from their counsel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, sir. My mother was a lawyer. Anyway, trust me. This is the argument that they will make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay then, where are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the cryonics technician said Hamilton was shot twice in the chest. They turned over his clothes and based on the holes in the shirt it looks like it was a large caliber bullet. There’s still money in his wallet, suggesting it wasn’t a random mugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, what about the briefcase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Technicians said that there wasn’t a briefcase at the scene. I called up Hamilton’s wife; she was adamant that he left the apartment this morning with a briefcase in hand. She’s on her way in right now with a Dr. Philip Boyd. He’s a colleague of Mr. Hamilton’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hamilton’s office at Hudson University was broken into three days ago and his computer was smashed. Security never found out who did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Check into it. See if you can find something that campus cops missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like something in that office of briefcase was worth killing for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then find out what, Detective. And get the wife to release his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CYNTHIA HAMILTON</speaker><content>I can’t do it. I have to honor Lester’s wishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Hamilton, you do understand that without your husband’s body we might not be able to solve his murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>If preservation is discontinued he’s going to be gone forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well with all due respect, he already is gone forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>PHILIP BOYD</speaker><content>Lester would dispute that. He and I have been colleagues at Hudson for twenty years now and uh, he’s a true believer. For him, the keys to life extension, to reversing death itself, were within reach, so he would never give up his chance at revival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Do you know why he chose to focus on life extension?  We fell madly in love with each other. He told me that one lifetime together wasn’t enough. He wanted more. So do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Hamilton, we think that whoever killed your husband might have stolen his briefcase. Do you know what was in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>His research. For the Ambrosia Project. He always had it with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ambrosia, as in the food Greek gods ate to achieve immortality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was the Ambrosia Project exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Philip, how would you explain it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Ah, it’s a little outside my wheelhouse, but … Lester was developing a pharmaceutical implant that caused the body to produce young cells instead of aging ones. He expected it to extend human lifespan by ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Treatment like that would be worth a fortune to Big Pharma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Billions. But most of the money would have gone to Beau Randolph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beau Randolph? The guy behind College Girls Gone Crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is a ­  – how is a porn mogul connected to all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Us researchers take our funding where we can get it. Randolph made a killing in porn and now he fancies himself a venture capitalist. He’s funding Lester’s research, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>He was. Lester cut all ties with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Lester wanted to take an open source approach – publish his research online and then develop it with his peer to speed up results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that way no one could hold a patent on the results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how did Randolph feel about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Oh, they had awful fights about it. But Lester was adamant. In fact, he was supposed to upload the data today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did your husband and Mr. Randolph have their falling out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Three days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Three days ago. That’s when his office was broken into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Beau Randolph is distasteful, of course, but … do you really think…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think that losing billions of dollars is motive for murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, not only is Beau Randolph the proud owner of a Smith and Wesson .45 automatic –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is a large enough caliber to have created that entry wound in our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He also has a carry permit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Wha-? I couldn’t even get a carry permit. How did he get one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The hard way. Several guys saw their girlfriends in his videos and beat the hell out of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No longer jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The gun still doesn’t tie him to our murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but this might – a charge on our vic’s credit card. At 6:30 this morning he bought breakfast at Medusa Diner. I talked to the waitress, guess who was with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beau Randolph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And there was a whole lot of yelling going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>6:30. That’s 10 minutes before Hamilton was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Ambrosia Project. Sounds like a Robert Ludlum novel where the millionaire playboy kills a researcher to get his hands on a secret formula for eternal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, ten years is not eternal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you do it? Would you get the implants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think I need them. Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I mean the pharmaceutical implants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I could live to 100 instead of 90? No, I think I will pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if you could stay the same way now for the next ten years?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could you not want 10 extra years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, one thing I’ve learned is that you never know how much time you have and if I thought I had more, I might just end up wasting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re going to have to get those implants, otherwise you’ll get older and 10 years from now I’ll still be exactly the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Isn’t that how you’ll be anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. Mr. Randolph will be right out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>PRODUCER</speaker><content>Everyone here for Sorority Pillow Fight #7 c’mon back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone needs to get these girls clothes made of actual fabric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, when did you become so judgmental about practically naked women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since my daughter hit college age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there he is. Defiler of co-eds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. Beau Randolph.  Are you sure you’re not here to audition for my ‘Post-docs Play Doctor’ series?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Then what can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can answer a few questions about Lester Hamilton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like why did you kill him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Yeah, I was with Professor Hamilton at the diner this morning. The only crime was how bad the food was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Witnesses say that you fought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>That’s right. I sunk millions into his research and suddenly he wants to give it all away? There’s one thing internet porn has taught me. You don’t get rich by giving it all away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that why you killed him? So you could secure Ambrosia before he uploaded it for everyone to see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>It’s why I walked home and called my lawyer to issue an injunction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The doorman said you came home at 7:10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Sounds right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lester Hamilton was killed at 6:40 this morning. Plenty of time for you to put two in his chest before walking home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him. But I know who did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you really? Would you care to share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Look, last month the NIH rejected him for human testing. Now, I told him the setback was temporary, but he said he was too close to a breakthrough. He wasn’t going to let a bunch of bureaucratic scientists get in his way. A week later I notice $100,000 missing from the account I set up for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think he went ahead with human testing without approval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Yes. In secret. And then he tells me to take a hike. I think he had that breakthrough. I think the Ambrosia Project worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a very interesting theory, Mr. Randolph, but you still haven’t told us who you think killed Hamilton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>If he was doing illegal testing, where were his test subjects coming from, hmm? I can tell you this – they weren’t clean cut college kids. They’re the kind of folks who don’t like needles and are likely to possess firearms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here’s my view, and unlike yours, mine is based on fact. You sunk millions into Hamilton’s research  and just as you thought that Hamilton was making a breakthrough, he cut you off. That is motive. You have a large caliber gun; Hamilton just happened to have been shot with a large caliber gun. That is means. And you were seen arguing with Hamilton ten minutes before he was killed. That is opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>That’s conjecture, Detective. You have no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, I do. CSU just found that your .45 caliber gun was fired this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ouch. You know what we call that.  The smoking gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Well, that had nothing to do with Hamilton. There was a flock of pigeons on my roof this morning, squawking. I was trying to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pigeons. That’s what you’re going to go with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Given that the only evidence you have is frozen inside Mr. Hamilton, yeah, that’s what I’m going with. In the meantime, I’d like my lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Smug, self satisfied son of a b*itch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, but with no witness to the shooting all we’ve got is a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And since we can’t match ballistics without the bullets, we can’t even prove it’s the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thank you, Mr. Castle. I know how ballistics works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, we need that body otherwise we don’t have a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ll call the DA. I don’t care if case law is murky. We have a suspect now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Here’s the deal, boys. The DA’s office believes that we currently have sufficient grounds to obtain a warrant and take custody of Lester Hamilton’s body as evidence in his murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ROSEN</speaker><content>You know we’ll fight you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do you really want to risk that case law will be established on the basis of these extraordinary circumstances? Case law that will limit the rights of all your clients? Now, I’m hoping that we can find another way, but I need that body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ROSEN</speaker><content>We can’t surrender our client’s chance at a long productive future life because it proves inconvenient for the state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then I’m sure you’ll be hearing from the District Attorney’s office shortly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>There may be another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Our admittance x-rays show that Hamilton’s heart was damaged by the bullets, so maintaining the body is no longer a priority. Cryonics is mostly about preserving the brain. By the time the technology exists to revive Hamilton, we’ll surely be able to regenerate our bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Bottom line, we can keep the courts out of this. And you can have Hamilton’s body immediately,  if you agree to leave his head in storage at Passageway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then we have a deal.  Now all we need to is match ballistics to Randolph’s gun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They’re not a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean, they’re not a match?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I mean, the bullets in Lester Hamilton’s chest were not fired by Beau Randolph’s gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, I just sit down here all day and make stuff up. Of course I’m sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Here’s the ballistics report. Randolph’s gun is a .45. Headless here was shot with a .38.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Getting that body was supposed to sew our case up, not blow it apart. How could those bullets not match?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have a theory, but you’re not going to like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I’m open to anything right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Randolph is innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right. I don’t like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Randolph couldn’t be the only one who wanted Hamilton’s research. Maybe a competing life extension researcher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe. I’m going to call his wife up and see what she knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s spinning out. She’s never not gotten something she’s set her sights on. Do you mind if I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. You should be with her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Castle. I think I can manage without you for a few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Don’t look so happy about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Ryan. What’s up, man? Where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Down at the college, running down that break in in Hamilton’s office.  So, listen to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That, my friend, is Beau Randolph’s alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A dead pigeon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>CSU found it on the roof of his building with a slug in its belly from his .45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Seriously? So Randolph really did commit murder, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m just writing him up for animal cruelty right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe there’s still time to cryonically freeze the little guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hamilton’s office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, so, first off, Hudson’s campus cops, wow. I know what we’ll be doing when we’re fried and don’t care anymore. At least they bagged the evidence. We were able to pull prints off of Hamilton’s smashed computer. They matched one of his students, an Eddie Peck. Straight As, no record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then what was he doing breaking into Hamilton’s office and smashing his computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, tell me If this answers your question. His father is a lead researcher at Smith Briar Pharmaceuticals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Big Pharma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Young Peck stole Hamilton’s research for his dad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Does that look familiar, Peck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It should. It had your prints all over it. We know you broke into Hamilton’s office. What were you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>EDDIE PECK</speaker><content>It wasn’t supposed to turn out this way, I swear. I just – I didn’t want to be a disappointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>To who? Your father? You did this for him, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>You don’t know what he’s like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What did you do with the research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>What research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Professor Hamilton’s. The Ambrosia Project. It was inside his briefcase and that’s why you killed him, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>Killed him? No, no! I asked him to change my grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>I met this girl, Susie, at the beginning of the semester. I’d never been in love before, but I fell hard, man. When I wasn’t with her all I could do was daydream about her, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell are you talking about? What does your love life have to do with any of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>Because of Susie I didn’t study for Professor Hamilton’s midterm. I got an F. We don’t get Fs in my family, especially in bio. My father would kill me. So I broke in to Hamilton’s office and tried to change the grade in his computer. But I didn’t know his password. I got frustrated and threw it against the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t you lie to me, Peck. Hamilton’s grade report said you got an A on his midterm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>That’s because the next day I followed him, tried to work up the courage to beg him to change my grade. But before I could, we were in this scary neighborhood and he went into this seedy hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And what was he doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>I don’t know. But he came out like an hour later and when he saw me he totally wigged. Like, eyes popping out of his head crazy. He offered to change my F to an A in exchange for me never telling anyone he was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This hotel have a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>The 130th Street Inn.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Ah… booked his room solid for the last month. Paid cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What was he doing here for a month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Sweet pea. This is a don’t ask, don’t tell hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you didn’t ask, but could you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Little dude made a big deal about no one ever going into his room for any reason. Not even to clean. I figured he had a blowup doll collection or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is this a boy in the plastic bubble thing or what?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who the hell is Hamilton operating on and why here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His Ambrosia Project. They said he was on the verge of a major breakthrough but got turned down for human testing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like Beau Randolph was right. Hamilton decided not to wait.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, any word on what was going on in Hamilton’s hotel of horrors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s running test results on the bloody instruments, but so far it looks like at least one test subject wasn’t pleased with the results. CSU found that note in the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“You told me this would work. I trusted you.” Looks like Beau Randolph was right. Hamilton was doing human testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like it didn’t go as planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Frankenstein’s monster came back and killed Frankenstein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No luck IDing the note’s author. The only prints CSU found in the room were Hamilton’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Hamilton’s wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We checked with her, his colleagues, and his students. No one even knew he was doing any secret research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, someone knew about it. Canvass around the hotel. There’s a big homeless population in the area. Maybe that’s where he got his subjects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I don’t get Hamilton on a character level. Why would he risk his reputation, his safety, to do illegal testing in some flop house? I mean, he was ready to give away his research, so it wasn’t the money. Why was he in such a big rush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s got the DNA results.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So did the labs tell us who Hamilton’s test subjects were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Preliminary DNA results from the needles and the drill show that the DNA is all from the same person.  Lester Hamilton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … Lester wasn’t doing to procedures on someone else. Someone else was doing them to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he decided to put his money where his mouth was, using himself as a test subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But then who was doing the procedures on him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how did it even get him killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Can I just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe the treatment was a success. Hamilton realized he was on the cusp of a revolutionary life extension breakthrough.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could you believe that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Guys! Hold up! Stop doing that thing you do for one second.  Thank you. Now, all of the theorizing is cute, as usual. But we’ve got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The Ambrosia Project implant is supposed to be in the patient’s arm. I checked his arms, in fact, I checked every inch of Hamilton’s body. There were no intrusions or wounds anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t understand. I thought you said the needles had his DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They do. And his brain matter, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So whatever they were doing they were doing to his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is the only part of Hamilton’s body that you haven’t checked yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Get me his head and I can tell you what this is all about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>We had an agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was before, when Mr. Hamilton’s head wasn’t relevant to this case. Now it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Please –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Weiss, I have a warrant and you’re welcome to read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>I know it’s legal, but think of Lester Hamilton’s wishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His wishes right now come second to this murder investigation. Now open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’ll be as minimally invasive as possible, Dr. Weiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Any invasion at all will destroy memory, personality, vital functions …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>It’s gone. The thermal storage unit should be right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You gotta be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you saying that you lost his head?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CYNTHIA HARRISON</speaker><content>I don’t understand. How does my husband’s head just go missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s what we’re trying to figure out, Mrs. Hamilton. Do you have any idea who could have operated on him at the 130th Street Inn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>I already told Detective Beckett, I don’t know anything about that. Now, I need to find him immediately. I need to make sure that his wishes are being respected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I understand, and I promise you that we are doing everything that we possibly can –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>What about Dr. Weiss? He’s in charge over there. Have you spoken to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Detective Beckett is with him right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>I’m just as concerned about Hamilton’s head as you are, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>There must have been a break in at our storage facility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A break in. Really? Is that what you’re going with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>We’ve never had anything like this happen to one of our clients. It’s the only thing that makes any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I will tell you what makes sense, Dr. Weiss. Either you’re part of a cover up or you’re a murderer. Or both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>What? Why- why would I kill anyone? I have a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, did you take them into consideration when you colluded in moving a body from a murder scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>That was a one in a million circumstance and everyone ended up getting what they needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why is it that at every step of this investigation you have gotten in my way? Hamilton ends up dead and in your custody. The DA’s about to turn over the body to me and you negotiate to keep the head. I get a warrant for the head and suddenly it ends up missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>The only thing I’m guilty of is trying to protect Lester Hamilton’s desire to be cryo-preserved. I don’t know anything about his murder. Please check with my company, there must have been a break in.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out there was a break in at the Passageway storage facility in the middle of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No way. And they took the head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Security video. Just watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Last night, 3:32 AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hamilton’s storage container?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hamilton’s dead friend and colleague.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Boyd.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD! Open up, Boyd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t think he’s opening up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He went out the window to the fire escape!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s got the head. Beckett, he’s got the head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can see that. Dr. Boyd, stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>No…!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Talk about taking a header.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll get the head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Got it! I got Hamilton’s head.  I think it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You are under arrest for the murder of Lester Hamilton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him. I was trying to save his life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>TECH</speaker><content>He’s going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>TECH</speaker><content>Why would anyone steal a head?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Boyd, it seems we caught you red handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, why did you steal his head? Did you miss him?  We know about your operating room at 130th Street Inn. You were doing surgery on Hamilton’s head, but it had nothing to do with life extension. So either you tell me about it or we find out on our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>He came to me a month ago complaining about severe headaches. An MRI showed that he had stage 4 glioblastoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A brain tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Inoperable, untreatable. He only had a few months to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, why did he go to you? Why didn’t he go to a hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BODY</speaker><content>Because as a scientist he knew the limits of current therapies and he was familiar with my work. Nanoparticle genetic theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>English.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Targeted treatment of tumors. I’m years away from human testing but … he was my best friend. How could I say no to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you set up shop at the hotel to keep it secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>If anyone found out I’d lose my tenure, my funding, reputation. We couldn’t even risk using existing operating suites. Lester swore he wouldn’t even tell Cynthia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then you got the money from Beau Randolph’s fund in order to get your supplies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>Yeah.  I did five procedures over the month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was he getting better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BOYD</speaker><content>No. A few days before he was killed I did an MRI that showed that the tumor was still growing. The treatment had failed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A brain tumor. That’s why Hamilton wanted to put his research project online, in hopes that someone would finish his research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve got Esposito running down Boyd’s alibi just in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Everything.  How do you do it, Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, that letter that you have framed in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My first manuscript rejection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. How can you stand having it there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because it drives me. And I got twenty more of those before Black Pawn ever agreed to publish In a Hail of Bullets. That letter … that letter reminds me of what I’ve overcome. Rejection isn’t failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It sure feels like failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, failure is giving up. Everyone gets rejected. It’s how you handle it that determines where you’ll end up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>My whole life has been about making sure I could get into any college I wanted. What’s it about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Give it time. You’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Were any of us at that age?  No, it’ll suck until it doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, speaking of sucking – Boyd alibi’ed out. He was at a department breakfast the morning Hamilton was killed. I mean, we caught the guy with our victim’s head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>99 times out of 100 you catch someone with a guy’s head, he killed the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, Boyd also provided the MRI’s of Hamilton’s head. Lanie confirmed that the tumor would have ravaged his brain in a couple of months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So in an odd way, he got lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Dr. Weiss said that cryonics was about preserving the brain. If Hamilton had lived, his brain would have been destroyed. Cryonic preservation wouldn’t have been an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then our killer inadvertently saved him for the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>One lifetime together wasn’t enough. That’s our motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it wasn’t so inadvertent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Hamilton. I understand that you’ve already spoken to Dr. Boyd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>Yes. It’s a lot to process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we were hoping you could shed some light on some evidence that just came in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your husband’s computer. The one his student smashed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The tech people here managed to recover a list of recent downloads. Included on that list was Passageway’s contract termination form. Any idea why your husband would download that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>No.  It must be a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, the tech assured us that the download list was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re sure he didn’t say anything to you about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because the best I can come up with is that your husband decided that working on his research until his brain gave out was more important to him than cryonically preserving himself. But you disagreed with him, didn’t you, Mrs. Hamilton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>How could I disagree with him when I didn’t even know about the tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you did know, and that’s why you killed him. So he would be preserved for the future before his brain was ravaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After shooting him you took his briefcase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>This is insane. It’s just wild conjecture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, it’s not. You got rid of the gun, of course, but we found your husband’s briefcase hidden in your building’s basement. There were traces of your husband’s blood on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker><content>I gave him that briefcase. When we got engaged.  I couldn’t just leave it behind. I had known for weeks that there was something wrong but Lester said it was just stress. And then a coupld of nights ago he passed out when he was getting ready for bed. Then he told me the truth. But … he wasn’t in his right mind. He was too concerned about his research. I needed to protect our future. Our eternity together. It’s what we always dreamed of.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Detective, would you consider this to be a crime of passion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would consider this a crime of love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice. Though, that would depend on whether Cynthia Hamilton was in love or insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, sometimes there’s a fine line between the two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Dr. Weiss. I have your release forms ready to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>I’m grateful, Detective. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll just need you to sign down there at the bottom and the charges against you and your employees at Passageway will officially be dropped by the department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>I’m happy to put this behind us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>It’s a biowatch signal. A client has just flatlined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Well, that’s strange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>The signal. It’s coming from inside this building.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The ring. On her right hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cyanide pill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>WEISS</speaker><content>Detective Beckett? Permission to have my technicians come and get her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, of course.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wouldn’t it be something if they reunited 100, even 1,000 years from now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, anything’s possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You really believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s what the great love stories are about, right?  Beating the odds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I hope they make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
