<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Almost there, Castle. Just another two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s already been two weeks. Two weeks is an eternity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, maybe next time we go skiing you’re not going to be such a showoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wasn’t showing off!  Okay, I was showing off a little bit, but I swear to you I can do a tail grab with my eyes closed. And without breaking my kneecap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Well, I am off. Now, the retreat is out of cell phone range, so if I don’t call you on your birthday it is not because I have forgotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I won’t think it’s because you’ve forgotten.  I’ll think it’s because you made other plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now wait a minute. You and Katherine were supposed to be celebrating in Bora Bora this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, you’re right. Have a great time on your retreat. On your only son’s birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It is a spa trip, darling, not a guilt trip.  He’s all yours. See you in a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>‘bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, c’mon Castle. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  I’ll get us a reservation and I’ll take you somewhere nice for your birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As nice as Bora Bora?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh! Katherine, your ride is here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. We had a body drop. I asked the boys to pick me up so I’d have enough time to make you breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m missing another case? No! C’mon! Take me with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! Not until you get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Castle. How’s the knee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not the knee so much as the boredom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I thought you writers liked being alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, if I could write. But the painkillers make me a little loopy. Last night I used the word ‘speculate’ three times in the same sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. You must be bored. You’ve actually gone Rear Window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis got me those as a joke to cheer me up. I have not yet resorted to voyeurism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then you are missing out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Give me those!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dude, she was just about to take off her towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, the towel’s off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless the body you’re looking at is dead, I suggest you drop those binoculars.  Okay, Castle –  - I will call you and check on you soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, what if I consult by phone? We could pretend I’m Charlie and you’re my angels.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why are men such babies when they get sick or injured?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s an evolutionary thing. Men who can get women to take care of them, they have a greater chance of survival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really, Espo? Where’d you read that? “You’re Making It Up Magazine”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Lanie. What do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Sorry sweetie. It’s a bad one. Multiple contusions to the head, evidence of fracturing at the base of the skull. From the patterning I’d say she was repeatedly struck by that bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do we know who she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The guard that found her ID’d her as Clara DeWinter, 35, lives in Queens, and married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was she doing in this alleyway in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>She was an IRS agent. Worked in this building here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Apparently she was working late. Employees sometimes cut across the alley to get to the parking garage next door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do we have a witness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but we may have something way better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>No idea, ma’am. Never seen anything like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s an infrared camera, so our attacker could be wearing some sort of high-intensity IR lights, which would be invisible to the eye but blinding to that camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>DESSENS</speaker><content>That’s pretty sophisticated for a street criminal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, this wasn’t a street crime. The person knew that that camera was there and took precautions. This was a premeditated murder.  Wait, go back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right there. That’s our killer’s car. All right, let’s have tech filter that image for make and model and let’s see if they can get us a better look at our attacker’s face.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>GAVIN DEWINTER</speaker><content>With all the cutbacks her workload increased. She’d stay late a couple times a week trying to catch up. On those nights I’d pick up an extra shift at the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>We had dinner around seven, then uh … both went back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how did she seem? Was she nervous? Upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>No. She was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what exactly did you wife do for the IRS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>Uh, she was an investigator. She went after tax evaders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she must have made enemies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content> Yeah. Pretty much everyone she audited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was there anyone in particular she had trouble with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>Uh, actually … yeah. We were out – out at dinner a couple of weeks ago and this guy comes barging into the restaurant, accusing Clara of destroying his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she tell you who he was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>Just another tax cheat she took down. She said it was no big deal, but I could tell. She was rattled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you tell me what he looked like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>Six feet, dark hair. You should check with her work.  She promised to file a complaint, so …</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Looks like we’ve got some beautiful clear skies with us today. A nice tailwind is going to get us there right away, folks. We’ll be there … zero dark thirty, zero dark quarter to.  Nice, Red-5. You’re looking good. Oh no! I felt something wrong!  Ooh, that’s not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Evade! Evade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Nooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> … survivors?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CHARLIE BLUNT</speaker><content>Look, most IRS agents get threats. It’s the nature of our business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did Mrs. DeWinter report any recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BLUNT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BLUNT</speaker><content>You have to understand. Clara was a rare breed. An IRS agent who actually liked her job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What does that have to do with her being threatened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BLUNT</speaker><content> The thing is, each threat requires an investigation, which is a headache for upstairs. It’s an unwritten rule that agents who report threats don’t fare well in performance reviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That unwritten rule may have gotten her killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And since you don’t have a record of the threat, we’re going to have to take a look at her audit files going back at least year.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. Must be writers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that better be for a sick child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, to be young and underemployed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. Slow down. All right. Maybe close the blinds. Mmhmm. All right, you kids, you have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone’s home early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? You’re going to kiss him now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe next time you’ll think twice about being cheating cheaters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh oh. Someone’s got some ‘splaining to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, guys. So tech couldn’t get us a better look at the attacker’s face, but they’re hoping to have an ID on the car by morning. What’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, Clara’s colleagues don’t remember her mentioning any explicit threat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But if we’re looking for people whose lives were ruined there’s no shortage of suspects. We’ve got houses that were repossessed, bank accounts that were seized, businesses that were shut down, and we’re only a couple of months in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so let’s put a list together and pull photos. See if the husband recognizes anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m … at work. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said you were bringing home dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, on my way home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So when are you leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When soon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like in … half an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He is so on to you. Ah ha, ah ha … here it comes. The inevitable huge breakup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don’t – don’t take the knife. Don’t –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m not going to get there any faster –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! Beckett – Beckett, listen. I think I just saw a murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why aren’t they arresting him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I know what I saw. He took a knife and followed her into the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I looked in the bedroom. Everything was fine. No blood, no body. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you look under the bed? In the closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, the guy was relaxed and fully cooperative. He let us poke around without a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he probably hid the body. If he was completely calm he could be a psychopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did he say about the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He admitted they had a fight, they broke up, and she left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not possible. I would have seen her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So … you were watching the whole time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  … well, not the entire time. I had to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So … she could have left and you didn’t see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s possible, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because he called her. Handed me the phone. I spoke to her. She confirmed his story. She was in the car on the way to her mom’s house in Philadelphia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, thanks guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But you do have a vivid imagination.  And you’ve been stuck inside for two weeks. What were you doing looking out the window anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bored? So you saw what you wanted to see?  When did you take your last pain killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was not hallucinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle. You’re here with a broken leg, binoculars, seeing a Rear Window scenario playing across the way. I mean, what are the odds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Astronomical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. I’m going to make us some dinner and then get you to bed.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Please don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, he was pacing back and forth in his apartment and he kept looking towards the bedroom. And then he slept on the couch. Now, why would you sleep on the couch when you have a perfectly good bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I could ask you the same question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll tell you why. Because he had a dead body in there. Ryan and Esposito didn’t find it because he hid it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you realize what you’re doing? You’re obsessing over this because you have nothing else to obsess about.  Why don’t you just come with me to the precinct, focus on a real murder, instead of wasting your time on an imaginary one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well actually, I was thinking about maybe doing some writing today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, as long as by writing you don’t mean staring out the window ogling at your neighbors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No!  That would be immoral and intrusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, like you’ve never done that before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. How’s Jimmy Stewart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You know, up half the night waiting for the neighbor to move the body. So did tech get anything on our killer’s car in the alley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, they identified it as a late model, light colored CLS-550.  I’ve got folks combing over Clara’s audit records to see if anyone lists that vehicle on a return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so I just got off the phone with security at Clara’s office. A few weeks back this guy tried to muscle his way past security. Now, they tried to detain him but he broke free and he tore out of the parking lot in –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A CLS-550.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This looks like the guy Gavin said was after his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, so I compared that photo to Clara’s audit files and I got a hit on this guy. Dan Renner. He’s an anti-government, pro-freedom hot head. Made a fortune on a chain of dry cleaners in Brooklyn that he’s neglected to pay taxes on in nearly a decade and because of Clara’s audit he’s facing criminal charges. His wife just filed for divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sounds like someone has an axe to grind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or a bat to swing. Pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He bought rope and a tarp. Not what would you need a tarp for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s blood. You’re washing away the –  – he’s washing away the blood!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>DAN RENNER</speaker><content>They took my house, my marriage. I was facing a jail sentence. So yeah. I wanted to have a few words with Mrs. DeWinter about the land of the free. That doesn’t mean I killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know what that is?  That’s a silver CLS-500, just like you drive, fleeing her murder scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>Just like the one I drove. Look, my 550 was seized by federal agents two weeks ago. You can check. And give what Mrs. DeWinter was going to do for me, I’m the last person who wanted her dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Going to do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>Yeah.  She came to see me a week ago. Said she needed a favor. And if I helped her, she’d make the criminal charges go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of a favor could she possibly have wanted from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>Because of how I hid my money – fake names, multiple IDs – she asked me to help her disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Disappear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>Yeah. She said if I helped her get a new identity she’d help me get my life back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would she want a new identity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>She didn’t say. But now she’s dead and I’m screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Renner, where were you two nights ago at 1:38AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>RENNER</speaker><content>At my sister’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett? Castle’s calling. He says it’s an emergency.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is not an emergency!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I caught him red handed. Literally, red handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so then it’s gotta be blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Red paint? Tomato juice? Beets? Red velvet cupcakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He bought a tarp and a rope. He brought them into the bedroom where I’m betting right now he’s cutting her into portable pieces. Get a warrant, search that place before there’s no evidence left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito talked to the girl. We know she’s alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you know it’s the same girl? It’s possible he paid someone to be his alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or it’s possible something else entirely is going on here.  Look, I know that you’re lonely and that you miss me. I miss you too. But you don’t have to keep making up things to have me come back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think this is a ploy to get you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I don’t mean to be like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know what you mean. All right? And I know what I saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, you know what? I have to get back to the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. You really don’t believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’ll be back later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? Don’t worry about it.  I’m fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. What was the emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wanted me to get a warrant to search the place across the way. It looks like he’s taking this whole thing pretty seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Should we be worried?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just hope he doesn’t do something stupid. Where are we with Dan Renner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His alibi checks out. And he was telling the truth about his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he’s telling the truth about Clara as well. Let’s dig deeper into her life. See if we can find anything.  Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s getting rid of the body.  Beckett’s going to have to believe me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>If you thought he was getting rid of the body, why didn’t you call Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, because she thinks it’s all in my head. A byproduct of my imagination and pain pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Like that time you were convinced my art teacher was a serial killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon! He looked just like the guy from America’s Most Wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Did you ever stop to think that maybe there’s an innocent explanation for everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, what is the innocent explanation for rolling up a rug and taking it out of your apartment at 3AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Yeah. That is pretty weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right? And then he didn’t come back until 4:30 this morning. Where’d he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don’t know but he’s up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s he doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh … he, uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? What do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> He’s taking off his clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Give me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ooh, he’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You shouldn’t be watching this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, neither should you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That’s creepy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Staring at the phone won’t make it ring. I learned that in junior high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Maybe I should go over there. I mean, his birthday’s tomorrow –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Trust me, he’ll call when he’s ready. And you’re not going to want to miss this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We went through all of Clara’s records. Turns out, she was hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Over half a million dollars in a secret bank account and she used every legal trick to hide it. Nobody, not even her husband knew about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This girl make $75k a year. How did she get her hands on half a mil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, at first we thought she was shaking down her auditees, but then we traced the deposits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All from businesses owned or affiliated with Tommy Valentino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tommy ‘the Shark’ Valentino? Why is an IRS agent taking payoffs from a crime boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know, but wanting to disappear, getting whacked in an alley? It’s all starting to make sense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s been two hours. What’s he doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh! Here he comes, here he comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s in the bags?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He took the body out in a rug. That could be clothing, bedding.  That’s her purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>If they broke up, no way she left without her purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She did not leave that apartment. At least not alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And now he’s obliterating her identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We need to call Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And tell her what? That we saw a man donning gloves and a respirator? For all we know he’s cleaning the bathroom. No. If I’m going to convince Beckett I’m not crazy I need proof. Something solid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, you can’t break in to his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the evidence we need is in that shredder. It’ll tell us who the victim is. We can prove she’s missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And what if he catches you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He won’t. Not if I have your help. Next time he leaves I’ll slip over there. You keep watch.  Make sure he’s not coming back. I go inside, I get whatever’s in the shredder, and I get out. Two minutes, tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>On crutches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The doctor did say I need more exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What if I go? I’m smaller, faster, and younger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. If you get caught you get a B and E on your record and you’ll never become President.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He’s getting away with murder.  You got a better plan?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’ve got a long list of indictments against you, Mr. Valentino. Assault, racketeering, murder 1, and yet no convictions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>TOMMY VALENTINO</speaker><content>I’m lucky that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, your luck’s about to run out. I have evidence connecting you to payments received by my vic, Clara DeWinter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>My client has no comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>VALENTINO</speaker><content> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Someone killed Clara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, looks like he does have a comment.  So you admit to knowing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>VALENTINO</speaker><content>Yeah. But I didn’t kill her. She was my tax consultant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You paid an IRS agent half a million dollars to act as your tax consultant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>VALENTINO</speaker><content>You bet your ass. No one’s going to Al Capone me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if this was a legitimate arrangement then why did Clara DeWinter go to such lengths to keep that money hidden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>VALENTINO</speaker><content>She hid that money from her husband. That’s why she took this job in the first place. She was afraid of him. She needed the money to get away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tommy the Shark’s alibi holds. He was with some associates at a nightclub that he owns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Doesn’t mean he didn’t send one of his boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, if he killed Clara he wouldn’t have talked to me. No, hiding the money, planning to disappear? Something else is going on here.  So</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, not much. He’s a manager at a big name supermarket in Queens. No priors, married seven years. Oh, and he took a million dollar life insurance policy out on his wife only three months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm. That’s no suspicious. You think he did it and set Renner up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After what happened at the restaurant, it would have been easy. All he’d have to do is rent Renner’s same CLS sedan and keep his face hidden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>While making sure the care was seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Pick him up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>All clear. Over.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, no.  Just get the stuff and get out of there. Over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’ll only take a minute. Over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bleach and paint. What are you trying to cover up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Blood stains. This is it! This is where he killed her! This is why Ryan didn’t see any blood! It was all in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad! Dad, he’s coming back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Get out of there! Get out, now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad! Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He’s coming in! Dad, he’s coming in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>No, I have it handled for now but I can’t leave it there forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>No. I was thinking Jimmy’s boat.  While he’s at work.  He’ll never know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>You think I did this? You think I could possibly hurt my wife? I told you we were happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not according to her sister. She claims that Clara was terrified of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content> Her sister. That woman has had it out for me since we started dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why did Clara hide money from you? And why was she planning on disappearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>How should I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You took out a sizable life insurance policy against your wife three months ago. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>GAVIN</speaker><content>I’d like my lawyer. Now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Supermarket confirmed he was there the night of the murder. He came in at 10, left at 3. It can’t be him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, get up to that store and talk to everyone that was there that night.  Tear apart his financial and phone records. If he hired someone we’ve gotta find out who.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, you did what?  And you helped him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, okay. This is not about what we did. This is about what he did. And check this out. I wasn’t able to reassemble the credit cards, but I found this in the bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>An invoice from a storage facility. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not just any storage facility. This one’s open 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And look what time he rented the space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>3:43AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last night at 3AM I watched him pull a rug out of his apartment. You know what fits in a rug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s where he’s storing her until he can figure out what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or the rug belongs to his girlfriend who asked him to keep it in storage until she’s ready to pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, then explain the bleach. The paint. And I overheard him say ‘I can’t keep it there forever’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, look. Someone’s coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s him. That’s the guy she was having an affair with. He’s looking for her. He wants to know where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you leave now, you can catch him. You can ask him where she’s is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If she’s really visiting her mother, wouldn’t the guy she’s having the affair with, who broke them up, be the first to know?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me. NYPD. Do you have a minute?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So his name is Brent Lansky. He and Emily have been taking a class together at Pace and he’s been texting her for the past couple of days but so far there’s been no response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What about her parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan tracked them down but they haven’t heard from her, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I’m not a drug-addled crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I know it sounds suspicious, but without a body or a missing persons report I’ve got nothing to go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, while you’re waiting for something to go on he’s already taken most of the evidence away. But luckily I know what he’s done –  – thank you – with the body. It’s in the storage unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re talking about an illegal search.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When you do it it’s an illegal search. When I do it it’s just illegal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, this is such a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, this is a brilliant idea. I break in, I find the body, then I call downstairs to the front desk, tell them that the lock has been cut. When they come up to see if everything is okay they find the body, they call the police, and you have probable cause. If you stay out here in the hallway you won’t be violating any rights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. I did not think this part through. If you’ll just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine Castle, but I was never here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just unroll it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s the body?  It’s in the bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God it’s her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, it’s a wig. And there are clothes in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can we get out of here before someone …  … sees us?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Illegal search? Breaking and entering?  You’re lucky I don’t have your badge. And you. What in the hell do you think you were doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But all the evidence. The rug, the storage space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Evidence? I just spoke to your alleged killer, Mr. Castle. He got that storage space at his ex-girlfriend’s request. He was moving her belongings there, including her rug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you know he’s telling the truth? No one’s heard from her –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We contacted her. She’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about the paint and the bleach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>He discovered mold and wanted to take care of it. Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sir, Castle is just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Embarrassing me and the department?  Oh, and Mr. Castle. Your neighbor did say that if you bother him in any way he will press charges. And I will be so happy to take you into custody personally.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey Castle. Is it hard to balance on those crutches when you’ve just had your ass chewed out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’ll be in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you two comedians find out anything new on the husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well there was nothing unusual in his phone or financial records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We talked to everyone at the store. They said he was there all night. But they did say that he was acting weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Weird? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well normally on the late shift he holes up in his office, but that night he spent all his time on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wanted to be seen because he needed an alibi. That guy is involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a great theory, but there’s only one problem.  We have no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I don’t say this often but I’m sorry. Sorry I got you into trouble, sorry I lost my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what, Castle? It’s okay. Your overactive imagination has actually brought a lot of people to justice. In fact, it’s one of the things that I love about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. And … wow. Happy birthday to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If that’s my present I can’t wait to unwrap it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Later. Right now let’s just forget about the murder, go to dinner, celebrate your life, come back, and celebrate some more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so the car’s going to be here in fifteen minutes. Would you like a drink from the fridge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He just got a soda from the cabinet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why get it from the cabinet? Why not get it from the fridge? Why not … get ice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s in the fridge. Those plastic trays in the closet? Those weren’t plastic trays, those were refrigerator shelves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know who Gates was talking to on the phone, but that was not Emily. Emily is in that fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s not in that apartment! She’s not in the fridge! There is no body!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes there is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you just apologized to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I rescind the apology. I take it back. She’s in the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Let’s just go downstairs and wait for the driver there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, I made plans for you. I dressed up for you. And I’m not going to let you ruin this night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to go over there and open that bloody fridge. And then you and I are going to dinner and never talking about this again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, don’t do it. It’s too dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not as dangerous as me if you blow up my plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well what if he doesn’t let you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look at me. He’s gonna let me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not if there’s a body in there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mmhmm.  Michael, Brent, Emily. My brilliant acting students.  I, of course, was the director.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. They were great. Except you didn’t have to kick down the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was in the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We wanted to be convincing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-36"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You really blew my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I figured the trickiest part would be fooling you and keep a straight face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well you win the Oscar for best pretend murder. I cannot believe the whole thing was staged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Staged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I just solved my case!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does that mean you’re going to go run off and arrest someone now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.  Right now I’ve got other plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Happy birthday.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry I had to drag you down here. But I think you might actually hold the key to solving this murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>Sure. But I already told you what I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, that you spotted the murder being committed on surveillance and then you called 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>That’s correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See, I’ve looks at this video dozens of times trying to see if I could find a clue as to who the murderer was. And then I realized, I’m looking in the wrong place. Do you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>See what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s actually kind of hard to spot. Um … that dot.  Right there. It’s graffiti that somehow magically appears on that wall.  Here. I’ll plat it for you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only way that it’s possible is if someone tampered with the feed and replaced the live image with footage that was recorded before that tag was made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>That would be impossible. Unless somebody –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Had access to the surveillance system, which you have. And if that is indeed a prerecorded image, then that means that the attack was faked. And that woman that is being beaten and then thrown into the dumpster is not the real Mrs. DeWinter. Now do you notice that she never actually shows her face. It’s almost as if someone is pretending to be her. Someone with the same frame. Someone a lot like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>That is not me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m guessing that the real Mrs. DeWinter was killed somewhere else earlier in the evening and that the killer planted her body in the dumpster so that it would be there when you and your colleagues viewed the faked footage. That video is the perfect alibi for the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>I didn’t even know Mrs. DeWinter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But you do know her husband. According to your personnel file, you worked night security at a supermarket in Queens a year ago. That is the same store as Mr. DeWinter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-17"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content>That’s just a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it also a coincidence that you rented a CLS-550 a week ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-19"><speaker>RIGAS</speaker><content> I didn’t kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know you didn’t. I need you to tell me who did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They met a year ago on the late shift and started an affair. Once they got together Gavin realized that he’d have to get rid of his wife and instead of a messy divorce, they decided to make a killing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Some marriage. No wonder Clara wanted to disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but she didn’t do it fast enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So where did the actual murder take place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In the DeWinter’s garage. After dinner he bludgeoned her to death with the bat that he left in the alleyway and then he changed her into the clothes that Rigas wore on the tape. And just before placing her body into the dumpster Rigas switched to the dummy feed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Perfect crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  Almost.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Glad I could help with the case, even though it was by accident.  How many murders do you think we’ve solved since we’ve met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. Um … maybe a hundred or so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A hundred?  Here’s to a hundred more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, what you did for me … nobody’s ever done that for me before. That was … epic.  But you do know that now I will have to get you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh really? And you think you can top that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, just you wait and see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-7"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
