<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>KOVAKS</speaker><content>Your daughter is out of surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>JIM BECKETT</speaker><content>Will she be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>KOVAKS</speaker><content>Well, during the surgery she experienced cardiac arrest.  Now, we were able to get her heart beating again on its own, but we’ll need to watch her very closely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>JIM BECKETT</speaker><content>When can I see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>KOVAKS</speaker><content>Well, once the nurses get her settled we’ll bring you back to her. The rest of you should go home, get some rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know about you, bro, but home is the last place I’m going. Not until we catch the son of a b*itch who did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right behind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>We’re fine. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is the shooter’s rifle. It’s clean for prints. Lab’s running a trace right now for DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, what about the gun? Can we track the gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to the DOD, the serial number matches a weapon that was issued to one Martin Holst, a Navy Seal what was killed in action 7 years ago. His body was recovered in a subsequent mission but the weapon was not.  Anything from the K-9 unit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dogs picked up a scent, traced it to the west side of the cemetery, but then they lost it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In a sea of cops, how does this guy go unnoticed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He may not have. Half the guys we talked to remembered seeing a groundskeeper taking cover from the shooter behind a tree. But according to the grounds staff, none of them were in the area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He blended in during the chaos and then disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If this guy’s some pro for hire he could be halfway to Cuba by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well then, we’ll go to Cuba and find his ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It just doesn’t make any sense. It was supposed to be over.  Montgomery sacrificed himself, killing Lockwood and all his guys. He said he was ending it. He said he was doing it to keep her safe. So if the plan was to keep her safe, why the hell are they still coming after her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know, bro. God knows who else is involved.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.  Yeah. Are you sure?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>Well, this bracelet looks good on you. It’s not diamonds, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>JOSH</speaker><content>I’ll see you after rounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re staring at me. I must look … really bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I just never thought I’d see you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I heard you were opening a flower store, so I thought I’d pitch in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They were all here when I woke up. I think they’re mostly from the precinct. I don’t think I’m going to live this one down, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I hear that you tried to save me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You heard? You don’t remember me tackling you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I don’t remember much of anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I, um, I remember that I was on the podium and I remember everything just going black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t remember …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>… the gun shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They say that there’s some things that are better not being remembered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I keep seeing his face, Castle. Every time I close my eyes I see Montgomery lying on the hangar floor. You should have let me go in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They would have killed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, you don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m really tired right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.  Of course. We’ll talk tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you mind if we don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just need a little bit of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure. Sure. How much time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll call you, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>PHONE OPERATOR</speaker><content>United States Capital, how may I direct your call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>MYSTERY MAN</speaker><content>Congressional offices, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>PHONE OPERATOR</speaker><content>Hold please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. What are you doing here? Didn’t think you were back until next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, two months of listening to crickets in my dad’s cabin was driving me nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s okay. You don’t have to make excuses. We know you missed us. That’s why you couldn’t stay away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Still nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what about the groundskeeper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The guy’s a ghost. We ran face hits on surveillance, license plates … nothing panned out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We did get DNA off the weapon, but there were no matches in the system. We flagged it, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Didn’t Castle tell you about all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s weird. Why wouldn’t he … why would he hide that from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He isn’t hiding anything, I just haven’t seen him in awhile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How long is awhile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pretty much since the shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing happened. I just needed some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, and he left you alone for three months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, it wasn’t his fault. I told him that I would call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, why didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was here with us, every day, working the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>For months. He’d still be here if the new captain hadn’t kicked him to the curb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She kicked him out? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Apparently her precinct’s got no room for, uh … “dilettante writer playing cop”.  Captain Victoria Gates, aka Iron Gates. She’s as by the book as they come. She cut her teeth as a detective in Internal Affairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. That’s not going to win her any popularity points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s like she brought her distrust of cops along with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, one thing’s for sure. She’s no Montgomery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Hey, if she hasn’t talked to Castle she doesn’t know about the bank yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, well, we didn’t get any traction with the shooter, so Castle suggested we check out Montgomery, McCallister, and Raglan, see who they might have been in business with back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We know those guys were getting fat ransom, and wise guys maybe used that stash to pay off the guy who paid off your mother’s murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and Castle thinks he’s found the bank that they used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So there’s a money trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-34"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The only problem is that the bank closed down. No one knows where those records ended up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-35"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We were working to locate them when Iron Gates shut down the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wha - she shut the case down? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-37"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No new leads on the shooter. And we couldn’t tell her the rest of it without implicating Captain Montgomery.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, back on active, as of today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. Your reputation precedes you. Youngest woman in the NYPD to make detective. You beat me by six weeks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You were on disability for three months. Reg says you don’t get your piece back until you re-qualify.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about my case? What did reg say about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Three months with no leads and every day more homicides coming through that door. How long did you expect me to let those folks tread water? There were good people on this case. There just isn’t anything out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, sir, but with all due respect, those people aren’t me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know what kind of shop Montgomery was running here but it’ll be a cold day in hell when I let a cop, any cop, investigate their own shooting. My precinct is no place for vendettas.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You want to see the files, you’re going to have to talk to him. Whatever you do, don’t get caught.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Worse. It’s not like it was before. We go against her orders on this, we could all lose our badges.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I watched you die in that ambulance. Did you know that? Do you know what that’s like? Watching the life drain out of someone you –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Josh help you with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We broke up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I like the dedication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It seemed right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It must have been hard, writing that ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah.  Given the circumstances, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why did you guys break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I really, really liked him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But that wasn’t enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After my mother was killed, something inside me changed. It’s like I built up this wall inside. And I don’t know, I guess I just didn’t want to hurt like that again. I know I’m not going to be the kind of person that I want to be, I know that I’m not going …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not going to have the kind of relationship that I want until that wall comes down. And it’s not going to happen until I put this thing to rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then I suppose we’re just going to have to find these guys and take them down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It doesn’t mean I’m still not mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The boys told me about what you did, following the money trail, trying to track down who the cops paid off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just wish it led somewhere. I mean, I located the files. When the bank closed they took all the dead account paperwork and stored it in a warehouse in Union City. But a couple years after the move, fire broke out and the files were destroyed. It’s just another dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did it happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An accident. It was old wiring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, there was an investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, did you see the report from the fire investigator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but … really, a warehouse fire? Seems an awful lot of trouble for a couple of files.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s no more trouble than they’ve already gone through. I mean, we have to read that report. It’s just … there’s this one problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How’re you going to help if Gates kicked you out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I only let her kick me out because there was no reason to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’ll take me back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You think you’re clever, Mr. Castle, going around my back like that. Well, let me tell you the score. I don’t care how powerful your friends are. You screw up on my watch and I’ll prosecute you to the full extent of the law. You understand me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes ma’am.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.  Now um, if you don’t mind …  I’d like my gun back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Showing her up with the mayor? You might as well have beaten a beehive with a bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it worked, didn’t it? Besides, it sure was great seeing her face twitch like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Sonya Gilbert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep. Guns, drugs, and love gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’re you with the boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>APB’s out, but he hasn’t been home and none of his band mates know where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was his motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The usual. He and the vic had been fighting. He was in love, she wanted out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Psst! Beckett!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I pulled the report on the fire from records. Check the date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That warehouse burned down three weeks after my mom’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone was destroying evidence. Evidence that could lead to your mom’s killers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But the investigator ruled it an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And there’s nothing in there to suggest arson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe someone altered it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s an easy way to find out. Just ask the man who wrote the report. Rod Halstead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless they got to him, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nope. He’s alive and on the job. Now get your ass over there and find something we can use to reopen the investigation.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we were just … we were getting a drink of water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Saddle up. We just got a hit on the APB. A beat cop ID’ed Sonya Gilbert’s boyfriend heading into the band’s rehearsal garage on the lower East Side. You too, Beckett!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why don’t we start with why you ran? Or why you were pointing a gun at a police officer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, I saw you. When you saw that gun, you froze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your hand was shaking. That’s not nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, it’s my second day back. That’s all. It’s no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if it happens again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>DALE</speaker><content>I told you! It’s not mine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why were you holding it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>ESPOSTO</speaker><content>We have witnesses that have you enter her apartment and then leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>DALE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s right. I was there, okay? And then … look man, I don’t know. I – I crashed and when I woke up and there was all this blood and this was in my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what are you saying, Dale? You sleep shot her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is that your defense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>DALE</speaker><content> No. Look, I’m saying it wasn’t me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you went to bed and you slept through your girlfriend’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Six shots. You must be a heavy sleeper.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Motive, opportunity, possession of the weapon? Looks like a murder one trifecta.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right. Contact the DA’s office, have them file charges and let the family know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Another lead? You caught the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, they were double checking eye witness accounts. Since it’s a high profile case Beckett wanted to make sure that we didn’t make any mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, that’s good to hear. Because we wouldn’t want her making any mistakes, now would we?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything that might indicate suspicious activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>HALSTEAD</speaker><content>Well, if there was anything suspicious, Detective, it would be in the report. Power surge to the junction box. One in a million event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So at no point did anyone pressure you into keeping information out of that report.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He likes to cuddle? I don’t know. It’s not like blowing away your girlfriend is a rational act to begin with. Why?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. There’s nothing in the files. He might have known them socially.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But we’ve been over their lives with a fine tooth comb. He’s never come up once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so he was a target of opportunity. He might have needed the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing in his financial records to indicate any problems and given his record, he’s …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Given his record, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just saying, what if he’s not our guy? What if the fire was an accident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It wasn’t an accident. I know it wasn’t an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can. Because if this was an accident I’ve got nowhere to start. If this was an accident I’ve got nothing. The guy who shot me is gone. Dick Coonan, gone. Hal Lockwood, gone. Montgomery, gone. My mom … everybody is gone, Castle.</content></utterance>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Missed you for dinner tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I’m sorry. I was working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You were with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thought you said you weren’t going back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not.  Look, I’m not. It’s just one case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah well, there’s leftovers in the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>MYSTERY MAN</speaker><content>Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>MYSTERY MAN</speaker><content>I’m a friend of Roy Montgomery’s. I’m calling about Detective Beckett. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who he was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just that he’s a friend of Montgomery’s. Said he owed Montgomery his life. He said Montgomery sent him some files, files that if they ever got out, could hurt some very powerful people. They were using those files as a threat to keep Montgomery’s family from ever being harmed. Beckett’s safety was also part of the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>But they went after her anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He didn’t get the files until after she was shot.  He says she’s safe now, on one condition. She can’t go near the case. If she does, he can’t guarantee her safety. If she digs, they will kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And this man, you believe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Then you have to tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If I tell her that, she’ll put on blinders and run out into the line of fire. I can’t let that happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You are not going to change her, Richard. She’s going to keep going out there and she’s going to keep digging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not if I stop her. She will listen to me. I can steer her away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>For how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not going to lose her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So I guess it’s not just for this case, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How much did you hear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, it’s really important you don’t say anything, all right? Especially to Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You act like this is all about her, but you were standing right next to her. You could have been shot! Hell, I could have been shot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why I have to do this. Make sure they stay away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah? You need to grow up, Dad. You’re a writer, not a cop. Stop pretending.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you remember what you told me the first time I brought up your mother’s case? That if you got started again, you wouldn’t stop. You said it would probably destroy you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I didn’t have any leads then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We don’t have any now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Castle, I got a little emotional last night. I’m … I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No you’re not.  And you know you’re not. You’ve been back here three days and you’re already in a free fall. I’m not telling you to walk away, I’m just saying … give it time. Just until you get your bearings again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How am I supposed to get my bearings when someone out there wants me dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By not letting them rob you of your life. I promise you, we will figure this out. We will find them and we will make them pay. Just not today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if I don’t do this, I don’t know who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re who you always were. You’re the one who honors the victims. You’re the one who can bring Sonya’s family some peace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hey. Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, according to the DA we just turned a slam dunk case into a Hail Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, super cop over here had to keep digging so, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>CSU found trace residue of barbiturates in the vodka glasses, which means Dale and Sonya were both roofied when they got back to the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it still could have been the boyfriend, right? I mean, he could have meant to roofie her but roofied them both instead, not that that makes any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, what other explanation is there? There was no one else in the apartment, and according to the security system no one entered or left the apartment between 10PM and 9AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which means the boyfriend has to be the shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The killer was in the apartment the whole time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When they came home they thought they were alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meanwhile, while they’re out of the room the killer slips out, spikes their drinks, and slips back into his hiding place where he –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or she.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- waits for them to pass out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Literally lying and waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then a couple of hours later he slips out again, grabs a pillow and bam, and he –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or she.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- wipes the gun clean and puts it into Dale’s hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wakes up, he panics, he runs, all the while our killer bides his time, waiting until the body is discovered before he makes his –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- escape. Gentlemen, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The blood stain on the bottom of the mattress dripped down onto the carpet. There’s no drip marks in the middle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Your light?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah. Fingerprints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like they found a killer hiding place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hiding under a bed for hours while the girl you just shot bleeds out? You’ve got to be one sick bastard to do something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s actually pretty clever. You commit a murder and frame an innocent man all at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then you get away with it because the police already think they have their killer and no one’s looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mitch Yancey. That’s Dale’s band mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t even think –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>MITCH</speaker><content>Put the gun down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-6"><speaker>MITCH</speaker><content>I said, put it down! Just … let me walk out of here, okay? That’s all I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t … don’t … don’t move, Mitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-8"><speaker>MITCH</speaker><content>I’ll shoot you, I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take it easy, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-10"><speaker>MITCH</speaker><content>I just need you to let me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take it easy. You’ve got this. You’ve got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-12"><speaker>MITCH</speaker><content>Put it down and stay back. Stay back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t want to do this, Mitch.  Because I will have to put you down. Do you understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put that gun down, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Turn around, put your hands behind your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mitch Yancey, you’re under arrest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Turns out Mitch had been seeing Sonya secretly for a year, all the time she was with Dale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mitch insisted she leave Dale, but instead she broke it off with him. So this was Mitch’s plan to take care of them both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He knew Sonya’s security code, but to frame Dale he knew that the system couldn’t record anyone else entering or exiting the apartment around the time of the murder, so he used a key that he’d stolen to slip in hours earlier in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right, cut the boyfriend loose. I’ll brief the press and let them know that we have a confession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, how does it feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But … it’s enough for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. For having my back in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That’s what partners are for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, and hey?  We’ll figure it out. That wall inside won’t be there forever.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. I do need to grow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that’s why I’m doing what I’m doing. Everything that’s happened happened because of me. And I need to be there for her. I owe her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Does she make you happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Is it enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s enough for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don’t grow up too much, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.  It’s me we’re talking about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="48"><utterance uid="48-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re probably surprised to see me back here. I bet most cops don’t come back after they pass their psych eval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>What’s on your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t even know where to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-5"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well, why don’t we start with the shooting. Is any of it coming back to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I lied. Before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-7"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well, what do you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I remember everything.</content></utterance>
