<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you seriously stay up staring at this Scrabble board all night instead of going to bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With these five remaining tiles I have to craft a word scoring nine points and I turn defeat into victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my gosh. Did you really beat Dad at Scrabble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I concede nothing. Except that I need more coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>That is quite an accomplishment, young lady. Nobody beats him. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. He’s mentioned that. Repeatedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah… how the mighty have fallen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“Richard Castle, one word short.” I cannot allow this to be my epitaph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I saw that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll concede defeat.  Thanks.  Because I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You’re letting me win after I already won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Under the condition that we have a rematch tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh wow, now you’re dictating the terms of surrender.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take it or leave it. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So what happened here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, according to our witness, one Logan Moore, was hauling ass on a skateboard with a guy on a motorcycle chasing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like a scene from an action movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. I know. Especially when the biker started shooting and Logan crashed through that window right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything about our victim that’ll explain what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet, just that he’s 21, has a California driver’s license. It’s about all we got at this point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So this biker, was our witness able to give a description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our witness is royally wasted. All he knows is that sometime between 3 and 4 it was Death Race 2000 out here. The evidence backs him up, too. CSU found fresh tire tracks in that dirt over there. They’re making casts as we speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So either this is the worst case of road rage ever or someone was hell-bent on killing Logan Moore. But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why was he out skateboarding between 3 and 4AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Well, if he needed some fresh air he got some by way of three holes in his back from 9 millimeter hollow points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>So no eyes on the shooter. There’s no security cam footage in this area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our victim’s from out of town, so he had to have been staying somewhere. Did you find a hotel key or a receipt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we did find this key hung around his neck.  And this scrap of paper in his pocket. It’s a West Village address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You and Esposito check that out. Castle and I’ll see what we can find out about our victim.  Can you just hang on for one second?  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Lanie, were you able to schedule the fitting for your dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Absolutely. And the dress that you picked out for me is gorgeous.  It’s the right mix of elegant and saucy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well I had to do right by my maid of honor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I’ve gotta go. I’ll see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So did we hear right? Are you Beckett’s maid of honor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, she asked me the other day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who Castle’s best man is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>First, congratulations Lanie. Oh, thank you! Second, I don’t know if he’s picked anyone yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You … really think it’s one of you?  You two.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The reality of it is is that Castle’s friends with famous people, like James Patterson and Stephen King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon, man. You really think Castle wants one of those guys standing beside him when he ties the knot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, maybe you’re right. Castle has spent practically every day in the precinct for the past few years. Why wouldn’t he ask one of us to be his best man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t he pick me to be his best man, is what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh Javi, I’m the obvious choice. If you can’t see it I can’t explain it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>Me and Logan hung out when I lived in LA. I really liked him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Was he staying with you, Holly?  Is this a key to your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>No. I – I don’t know where he was crashing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, did he stop by? Because your address was in his pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>Yeah. He did. But it was weird. Logan called last week, out of the blue. He was flying into town and he asked if he could have a small box shipped here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well if it was small why didn’t he just take it with him on the plane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>He didn’t want to deal with TSA because he said they always gave him a hard time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What was in the box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>His – his skateboard tools and stuff. At least that’s what he said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But you didn’t believe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>It’s just that when he came to get it he acted kind of strange. He noticed some tape had come loose on the box and he freaked out. He made me swear I didn’t open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>I don’t know. I – I really don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do you know why he flew into town in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>For the games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What games?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>HOLLY</speaker><content>Logan was a pro skateboarder. He was here for the New York Street Sport Festival. Down by Chelsea Piers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so the Street Sports Festival kicked off yesterday. Logan Moore was entered into the street style skateboarding event and favored to win. His star was on the rise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s all the more impressive, given his humble origins.  Logan’s bio says he was born in the Bronx, he bounced around foster care after his mother went to prison, then he ran off to California and made his mark as a skater and never looked back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he was killed by a gun-wielding biker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not in the bio, but obviously there’s more to the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so CSU ID’ed those tracks at the scene. They were made by Michelin S12. It’s a type of off-road tire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would someone ride an off-road bike on the streets? That would just wear the tires down to nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Unless it’s the only type of bike the killer had access to. One of the main events at the games is motocross and those are the tires they use. CSU is checking to see if any of those are a match to the track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So our killer could be connected to the games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep. And I’m laying money it was Manny Castro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who is Manny Castro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A top pro who had beef with Logan. Six months ago Logan showed him up in an event in Los Angeles and then beat him two more times after that. Tension got super high between the two of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. A reigning champion unable to cope with defeat.  That sounds familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but then yesterday things got physical.  A fan posted this on YouTube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>MANNY CASTRO</speaker><content>Hey. I’m talking to you, Logan. You think you can just walk away from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>LOGAN</speaker><content>Don’t touch me, man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>Your skating days are done! You’re done! You hear me, Logan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s Manny Castro now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s at the venue. They street style event just ended and Manny won.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa! Nice tail whip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. So you know the lingo? Any extreme sports in your history I’ve yet to hear about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I mean, I think catching killers is pretty extreme.  And then there’s marrying you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yes. I admit I am extreme.  Extremely handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep. With a high degree of difficulty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s Manny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>Yeah, no problem. A big heart for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>FAN</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Manny Castro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. We need to talk to you about Logan Moore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>The guy’s a loser. What’s there to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about his murder?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>When Logan didn’t show up for the event I – I didn’t know what to think but I sure as hell didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Manny, you repeatedly swore to do just that after he beat you in LA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And in Austin. And Tampa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>I talk a lot of trash. The fans go nuts for it. It’s all part of the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We talked to the front desk at your hotel. They said you left at 10PM last night and you didn’t come back until 5AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>I hooked up with a girl. She’ll tell you I was with her all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sure she will. But that video of you threatening Logan yesterday, that’s going to be a lot harder to explain away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>No, that’s not what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Because it looks like it is what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>Listen, right before that video was taken I caught Logan ransacking the festival mobile office, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ransacking, as in trashing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>It was more like he was looking for something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>I don’t know. And he wouldn’t explain himself, so I got up in his face. That’s what was on the videotape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You report it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>I was going to tell Tom Fulton, the festival CEO, but he begged me not to. So I kept my mouth shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would you do that for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>MANNY</speaker><content>Logan asked me for 24 hours. He swore it was a matter of life and death.  I guess he was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TOM FULTON</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m Detective Beckett.  This is my associate Mr. Castle. Uh … we’re looking for Tommy Fulton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>That’s me. News just broke Logan Moore as killed. I’m sick about it. You here about that or the break in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Both, actually. When was the last time you saw Logan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Two days ago. He was here doing some practice runs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he have any issues with anyone here? Or trouble with anyone on the circuit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>No. They guys play to win, but it stays out in the park, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what was taken from here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Uh … so far the only thing I know missing for sure is my gun. I kept a .45 in my desk. Legally registered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Logan know about the gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Wait, you thin Logan broke in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m assuming that would have been out of character?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Hell yes. He was on his way to becoming the next Tony Hawk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there any reason that Logan would have needed a gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Look, I know Logan, he had a tough go with things growing up. It wouldn’t be the first time a kid like that fell into a bad crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What bad crowd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>When Logan first came here to register, I remember he gets this weird phone call. He answers, and he says, “You got some nerve asking me to do this after all these years. Stay the hell away out of my life. Don’t ever call me again.” Then he hung up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea who he was talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>No. But he was pretty shook up. If he took my gun and someone killed him maybe there’s a connection.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, so Manny Castro’s alibi checks, and I talked to Logan’s competition. None of them remember anything about him hanging out with a bad crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if that bad crowed refers to an evil cabal that pays extreme athletes to duel to the death, all for the benefit of depraved millionaires.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean like the movie Rollerball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It would explain the motorcycle versus skateboard murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or … maybe it had something to do with the Albanian mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. According to his phone records, Logan received a dozen calls from a social club in the Bronx. The place is run by Albanians linked to organized crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t the Albanian mob infamous for being crazy violent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See if you can find out who was calling him from that club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m on it.  Oh, Castle. I – I got something for you. It’s that pen you liked. It’s an heirloom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s no occasion. It’s just ‘cause – ‘cause we’re bros. Best bros.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is fantastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No it’s not. It’s juvenile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So …  … Logan’s financials got us a line on where he was staying. All week he’d been ordering from GrubHub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean the food service?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. They were delivering meals to a loft in SoHo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whose loft was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Some trust fund kid. Likes to party with the athletes. A guy names Ross DeKoning.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content> Like you could do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … Ross DeKoning?  NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ROSS DEKONING</speaker><content>Wow, I’ve just got to say, you can come party here anytime. In fact, swing by tomorrow for my very special 21st birthday bash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Look, as tempting as that sounds, we actually just need to ask you a few questions about Logan Moore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ah, yeah. I was so bummed about what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I understand that he had been staying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, we used to skate together so when he asked to crash, I was like, absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did you see him when he left last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No. I don’t keep tabs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Before he moved to California, did Logan have any connections to the Albanian mob?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> Ah man, you think the Albanian killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What Albanian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That never even entered my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ross, what Albanian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>So maybe five, six years ago Logan’s mom dated this dude, Enver. He was into drugs and all kinds of bad stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was there ever any trouble between Logan and Enver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Major trouble. Logan helped send Enver to prison. And Enver swore he’d get even if it was the last thing he’d do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Enver Kotta. Convictions for armed robbery, assault, and possession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to the case file, Logan’s mom either had the bad sense to let Enver stash his cocaine at her apartment or she was in on the whole operation. Bottom line is Logan got sick of it. Called the cops. Logan’s mom ended up getting seven years while Enver did five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me guess. Enver cut a deal? Threw her under the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep. And guess what else? Enver just got on parole last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So when he realized Logan was in town he went looking for payback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, so it looks like Logan definitely had contact with this guy. Turns out Enver was a regular at that social club where the calls came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Let’s pick him up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ENVER KOTTA</speaker><content>Whatever happened to that kid I didn’t have anything to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You served five years because of Logan. It was no secret that you wanted him to pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that why you called him? To let him know what you were going to do to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>I didn’t kill Logan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then where were you last night between 3 and 4AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me help you out, Enver. Your credit card pouts you at a diner at 1:15AM where a witness saw you with Logan. That same witness said that when Logan left you followed him out. A few hours later Logan was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>Okay, I met with him last night. But I didn’t want revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what did you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>Prison changed me. I found the lord. Working my program means making amends for the things that I’ve done wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you expect us to believe you met up with Logan to apologize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>He didn’t believe me, either. So I kept calling him and calling him. He phone back yesterday, said he meet me. If I gave him $3,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why would he want $3 grand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>He just said he needed it. And if that was the price to sit down with him, well … I was willing to pay it. So I scraped up the cash. He must have still been afraid of me. He showed up at the diner with a piece. I gave him the money. Said how sorry I was for messing up his life. Told him I’d testify on his mama’s behalf, try to get her released early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did the two of you do afterwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>ENVER</speaker><content>He just said he had to take care of something before it was too late. Then he took off. And I went home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle. Oh! I have something for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Recipe for Shepard’s pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is this the one Jenny made that night?  That was outstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You remember you asked how she made it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, this is her grandma’s secret family recipe. Because I think of you as family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, Ryan. I’m touched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Always looking out for you, Castle. Always.  Remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.  So the doorman at Ross’s place where Logan was staying says that Logan came back to the building last night at 1:30AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he returned to the building after the diner and that supports Enver’s story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but Logan wasn’t done for the night. He was picking something up. Doorman says he went inside for second and came back out carrying a black duffle bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A duffle bag?  Could the doorman tell what was inside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, but he said it was heavy so he offered to hail a cab. Logan refused and jumped on his skateboard and rolled away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There was no duffle bag at the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe the killer took it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Canvas the area between Ross’s building and our crime scene. If we can figure out where Logan was taking that bag that should lead us to our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll get into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ready to go home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I am. I’m actually kind of tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not too tired to … you know. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>D for dyad, which means two people talking, as we are now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well actually, it’s been mostly you talking. Well, bragging, to be specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, word score’s a 9, plus the double word score brings it to 18, plus the 5 from the ‘ay’, that’s a total of 23, bringing my score to 312 versus your paltry 175.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, aren’t there more important things than winning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. That’s a notion created to comfort those who lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well I was thinking we could be doing something more interesting with our time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, in that case, let’s hurry up and finish this game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, how about I concede?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And steal my moment of triumph? No. It doesn’t count if it’s not official. Now take your turn and feel the bitter sting of defeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Quixotic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. So that’s a triple word score with the Q and the C, plus a double letter score with the X, and another 50 point bonus for using all my letters. How many points is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> 314.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I need to be alone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, keep me posted. All right. Thanks, Bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey man. I’ve been thinking. You know, Castle likes us both too much to have to make the pick for best man, so we should make the decision for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh …  … it’s his wedding. How do you propose we decide for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well … one of us is going to have to drop out. And by one of us, I mean you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Me? Why should it be me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Because – do you think Richard Castle wants you planning his bachelor party? Come on, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, Esposito. See, being a best man is a lot more than just preparing the bachelor party. I’m a family man, I represent high moral standing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I photograph better than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?  Let me tell you something. You’re going down. And just remember, I gave you an opportunity to bow out gracefully. You hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Castle. Hey buddy. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, as your close friend now I have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did she beat you at Scrabble again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Can we just talk about the case, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So the canvas to narrow down where Logan went with his duffle last night came up empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But do you remember the key we found on him? Well CSU, they traced it back to a 24 hour gym and it turns out that Logan was there between 3 and 4AM the night he was murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the last place he went before he was killed was a gum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And he didn’t stay long. His membership card was swiped in and was swiped right back out two minutes later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just long enough to drop off a duffle bag.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>GYM CLERK</speaker><content>Yeah, I totally remember Logan. He was in here every day on the rock wall, practicing his climbing.  This is his locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see him come in two nights ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>GYM CLERK</speaker><content>I wasn’t on duty, but we have security video. I’m sure I can get you a copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, it’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look at his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Climbing gear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. And a .45.  This must be the one Logan stole from Tommy Fulton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But why would he need a gun and climbing ropes that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Screwdrivers, wrenches …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That would be a glass cutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And tension tools. For picking locks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … Logan Moore wasn’t just a champion skateboarder. He was a thief.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Logan Moore. Child of a broken home who found solace and salvation on a skateboard. But did he use his skills as an extreme athlete to become a master thief? Did our outlaw skater become an actual outlaw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If he was a thief then what did he steal? We didn’t find anything of value in his locker or on his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well maybe the killer took it. Maybe that’s why he targeted Logan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So while CSU was processing that gym bag they found this receipt inside from the day he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From an electronics store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, in Midtown. The owner there said he remembered Logan because he asked for a hi-8 camcorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi-8? That’s an outdated format.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It sure is. The one he sold him was ten years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why would he buy a ten year old camcorder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he wanted to film his crime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Why not use a cell phone or a GoPro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey guys. Come check this out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we ran through security footage of the gym to see if anybody was with Logan when he dropped off the bag or if anyone followed him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Here’s what we found. These photo grabs correspond to the exact times Logan’s card was swiped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. That’s not Logan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But we’ve seen him before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, at Ross De Koning’s penthouse party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And he’s wearing a street sports tee under his hoodie so we checked out that website.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>His name is Carter Wexland. He’s one of the competitors so Logan would have known him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to his file he has a record of B and E’s and grand theft. And he’s also a motocross rider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just like our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CARTER WEXLAND</speaker><content>So I went to the gym? So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>At 3:40AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>I couldn’t sleep. What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The big deal, Mr. Wexland, is that you used Logan Moore’s ID card when he had just been killed nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ain’t hard to figure out where you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>Yeah, he loaned it me the day before. So I could work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was a quick workout, considering you were only there for only two minutes. You went there to drop off this duffle bag. And since Logan was carrying this exact bag earlier that night we know the two of you crossed paths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I wish you could see your face right now. It’s a neon sign flashing “I did it! I did it!”.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They got him on the run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.  I uh … I thought you could use a little pick me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s what friends are for, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, hey. How are the wedding plans going? Everything good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Great. Well, if there’s anything I can do to help, literally, symbolically, just let me know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The two of you did a job together and you had a falling out, then you decided you didn’t want to share the score.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>Dude, I’m telling you, I didn’t kill anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Carter. You had his bag and his ID on you. You were blocks away from where he was killed and you ride a motocross bike. With your criminal record this is going to be a slam dunk for the DA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>No, no, no. I’m telling you. The last time I saw Logan that night he was still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you admit to having seen him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>He heard about my past and hired me for a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so what was the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>A B and E. He told me he’d give me $3 grand to bypass an alarm system and belay in from a rooftop so that he could get into a fifteen floor office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was on the roof. He cut in through a window, went in, and then sent up the gear with the bag. That was the last I saw him. The plan was for me to disappear with the gear and then stash it back in the gym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he had a camcorder with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>Yeah. I – I mean, there was one in the bag. But it wasn’t there when he sent it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did he tell you what he was after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>No.  But when I saw all the trouble we were going to I told Logan I wanted a cut, not just the $3 grand. He got really pissed and said he wasn’t some criminal and this wasn’t about money. It was about making things right for a friend who died. He was really intense. I believed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Logan tell you who this friend was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CARTER</speaker><content>No, he didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shipping his tools ahead, hiring an accomplice, all the while using a skateboard event as a cover. Seems to me the reason Logan came back to New York was to commit this burglary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but what was he stealing and how is it related to this dead friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I’ll circle back around to the people who knew Logan, see if anybody knows of any break ins. Or a dead friend. Oh, and Castle? Do you want to come with me down to the skate park? I thought maybe we could stop by and get some of those bacon brownies that you love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had me at bacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh well, you might want to hold off on that offer.  That building that Carter and Logan broke into? It was only a few blocks from where Logan was killed, yet I checked the police blotter. There were no reported break ins that evening. But based on Carter’s description I was able to identify which fifteenth floor window Logan entered through. It belongs to a law office of Brett Zaretsky, esquire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was Logan doing breaking into a law office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You guys should probably go find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Come on, Castle. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rain check?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have you noticed anything odd about Esposito and Ryan recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re being nice to me. Weird nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well they probably just feel sorry for you after the beat down I gave you at Scrabble last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gloat all you want. I will have my revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Let’s just find Brett Zaretsky right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>New window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Hi.  We’re here about the break in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BRETT ZARETSKY</speaker><content>Well I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A thief didn’t break in through your window, Mr. Zaretsky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well why is the glass being replaced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>Oh. Small mishap with a bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Zaretsky, do you recognize this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>No, I’m sorry. I’m afraid I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you mind if we took a quick look around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, we might be able to help you assess any other damage this bird might have caused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content> Yes, I mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Zaretsky, were you or anyone else here two nights ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>Detective, if you want to question me, get a subpoena. If you want to come into these offices, get a warrant. Until then, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, there’s only one reason that lawyer would stonewall us and not report a break in. He’s covering something up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A shady law firm, a mysterious death, a young man righting wrongs. Maybe Logan Moore is like Erin Brockovich but with a skateboard instead of you know, other assets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Brains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Brains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Ryan, can you look into Brett Zaretsky’s law firm? Uh … press releases, court filings, lawsuits. See if there’s anything there that connects him to Logan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. I circled back around to Tommy, Ross, and Holly. If any of Logan’s friends died they don’t know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well someone must.  Where did you say that his mom was, again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Taconic Correctional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s see if she can shed some light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, I know what you’re trying to do. Why you’re being so nice to me? Beckett clued me in. And honestly, it’s just making it harder. So just … act normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Man. He really can’t decide between is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but I mean, can you blame him? Poor guy is in a no-win situation. But I may have a solution. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Okay, let me – let me get this straight. You guys want me to decide who should be Castle’s best man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s perfect. You’re the maid of honor so you pick. We let Castle know. Everybody wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Javi, this is ridiculous. Of course she’s going to pick you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s because there’s no better best man material than this man right here.  Right, baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javi, do you really think I’d pick you with our history? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well I guess that’s settled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What’s settled is, you two are idiots. I’m not picking either one of you. You want to know why? Because I’m not the groom.  Detectives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s just mean. Well, we can’t force Castle to choose between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s gotta be another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Logan ever talk to you about a friend of his dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe under unusual circumstances?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because we believe that it might be related to Logan’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was Jay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what happened to Jay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Logan ever talk about Jay’s death at the time? Anything out of the ordinary?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Jay Dixon, age 12. He died April 27th, 2008. Coroner ruled the death a homicide. It was never solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>COD was blunt force trauma to the head and his body was found at a construction site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any leads on who did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. There were no witnesses, no suspects. All in all it wasn’t much of an investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A 12 year old gets killed and no one cares enough to find his murderer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Logan did. Finding justice for Jay seems to be the very reason why he came to New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But why now? Why six years later? And why did Logan think he was running out of time? And what’s the connection to Zaretsky or his law firm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> If there is one I haven’t found it. He’s not named in this file and there’s no wrongful death or litigation against the property owners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, get ahold of Jay’s parents. Let’s see if they’ve been in contact with Logan recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, check it out. A search team just found this camcorder down the block from where Logan was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A hi-8 camcorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. CSU gave it a quick look. No prints, no cassette tape, but check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A bullet hole. So Logan must have had this one him when he was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It looks like someone tried to pry open the cassette slot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. The killer must have wanted whatever was inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know why Logan bought the camera. He didn’t intend to record something. He wanted to play an old cassette tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>You think that’s why he broke into the law offices? To get a hi-8 tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jay was killed six years ago. If there was evidence of his death it’s possible it could be on a format like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but we still don’t have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or do we? Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It must have torn when the killer ripped it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … voila.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>So I was able to digitize that tape fragment and recover about six seconds of footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look at the time stamp. April 27th, 2008.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the same date Jay Dixon was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I think I can improve the resolution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s that a construction site?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This could be footage of Jay Dixon’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>If you ever tell anyone what happened to Jay you’ll be dead too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Tommy Fulton, CEO of New York Street Sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like six years later Tommy made good on that promise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Six years ago Logan witnesses his friend’s murder and then Tommy threatened to kill Logan if he ever told what happened to Jay. After all these years Logan couldn’t live with the guilt and came back to expose the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the question is, what was that tape doing in the law office and how is Zaretsky connected to all of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think I figured that one out. Who do you suppose does all the contract work for the Street Sports festival?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brett Zaretsky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And Zaretsky represents Tommy Fulton personally.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>I hope you have a good reason for dragging us down here, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Come on, if this is about Logan I was at a club doing promotions from midnight to 4AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And where were you on April 27th, 2008 when Jay Dixon was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>You tell anyone what happened to Jay you’ll be dead too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When I asked you earlier this morning about Jay Dixon you said you’d never heard of him. And that was a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>That tape proves nothing about Logan or Jay’s deaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I can place you at the scene of a six year old, unsolved murder. I also have circumstantial evidence that you killed Logan in order to cover it up. Now, how much more do you think a jury is going to need in order to connect those dots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>Don’t explain anything, Tommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think you can hide behind attorney/client privilege if you conceal evidence of a child’s murder? I will have you disbarred and then you will stand trial alongside your client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you’d like to call your lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content> Don’t say another word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Brett, what’s the point? I mean, the whole plan’s screwed anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>Just stop digging our graves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>I’m not going down for murders that someone else did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>For god’s sake, shut your mouth, Tommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>No. Not this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you should leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>ZARETSKY</speaker><content>You can’t kick me out of here. This man’s my client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content> You’re fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Either you leave on your own or I’ll have you forcibly removed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tommy, what happened?  How did Jay die six years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>I started out making skateboard videos with Jay and Logan. That day I was taping the two of them and my friend DK doing tray flips. Little Jay, he was a natural. But DK couldn’t do it. He was never that good on a board. Jay, he had a mouth on him and he was rubbing it in DK’s face. DK just snapped. He grabbed Jay and … he slammed him against this beam. Over and over. By the time we could pull him off … Jay was gone. And the whole thing was caught on tape. Logan, he wanted to tell someone, but we were all too scared. DK wanted that video. He had the most to lose. So we cut a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of a deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>Five million for the tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of kid has five million dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content>DK does. With what he’s getting from his family it was a drop in the bucket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why you had to hang on to the tape. That money was in a trust fund. DK wouldn’t have access to it until his 21st birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that’s why Logan had to act right away. You were going to turn over the tape and it was going to get destroyed, along with the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-31"><speaker>FULTON</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Cheers guys. Here you go. Happy birthday to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hey Detective! Stoked to see you.  Like my new company logo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s killer.  In fact, Ross De Koning, you’re under arrest for the murder of Logan Moore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the murder of Jay Dickson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tommy Fulton told us everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry to ruin your birthday, DK. But look on the bright side. You’re 21 now. You have control of your trust fund so you’ll have plenty of money to spend on your defense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I won’t have to, brah. ‘cause you’ve got no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think we will, brah. After we take a look at that motocross bike in your garage and match it to the tire treads at the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We have officers searching your loft right now. What are the odds they find the 9 millimeter you used to kill Logan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where do you think you’re going?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With Tommy’s testimony the DA is confident that he’s going to get Ross De Koning convicted for both murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least Logan succeeded in his quest. He found justice for his friend. And to think all of this happened because Ross couldn’t bear being second best. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You would deny me a chance at redemption?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well keep on this path and there’s a lot you’ll be denied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Castle, you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we need to have a little man chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There are … some reports that I have to file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we’ve been doing a lot of thinking and well … we know what you’ve been going through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. We know how tough it’s been so we decided to make it easy for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. We talked it over and now you don’t have to choose. We’ll both be your best man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Co-best men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And believe me, we’re going to do it up right for you. Best of both worlds, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … guys, I’m, uh – flattered and honored –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, you should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But I already decided.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You made the right choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re talking about me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think we’re going to have a great time. The ideas that I’ve already come up with are pretty amazing. I know this best restaurant –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>… I am on the VIP list -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys.  I asked Alexis to be my best man. Aside from Beckett, she’s the most important person in my life, so I - … you will be my groomsmen though, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, man. I’ll be there. Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. I wouldn’t miss that day for anything. It’s going to be magical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s your day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I did not see that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t believe I gave him my pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t believe I shared our family’s secret recipe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t believe we just got beat by a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s never speak of this again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Speak of what?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So um … where’s your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, she and Alexis went to dinner and midnight sing-along of Grease. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘cause. I’m ready for a rematch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>New game. Poker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want to play poker against me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Strip poker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll deal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I’m going to go all in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too. But all I have left to bet with is this shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll take that bet. What’ve you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is so much better than Scrabble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
