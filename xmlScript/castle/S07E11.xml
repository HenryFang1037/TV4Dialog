<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it is morning, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, it’s just that ever since you were banned from working cases with Katherine you and your pajamas have seen an awful lot of each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you’re exaggerating. I admit, I’ve taken the occasional day off to recharge, but I hardly think it’s fair –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, Castle. You’re dressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes! I’m dressed. I did not think it would be such an event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Morning, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does this mean you have something special planned for today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I do have something special lined up. A surprise, actually. For you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? What kind of a surprise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, now, if I told you that it wouldn’t be a surprise. But trust me, you’re going to love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, now why does that scare me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Because you’re smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm. Come on, Castle. Spill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A master interrogator like yourself and that’s the best you’ve got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe I’m just getting started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Victim is Shana Baker. According to her paystubs she worked at Eastborne Preschool.  Point of entry is a window in her bedroom. Somebody broke the glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She would have heard that. And based on her body position it doesn’t look like she was trying to run away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>SIDNEY PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>No, she wasn’t. No signs of defensive wounds or struggle. Just a single gunshot to the chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means our killer was in here when she came home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>How a woman so astute could choose to marry Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Perlmutter. Admit it. You miss him, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Please. Just knowing he’s not going to be here makes coming to work sheer bliss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>All things considered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Ah, lividity and liver temp suggest between nine and ten-thirty last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The neighbors were out, which is probably why no one heard the shot, but CSU … they did find this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A cigarette butt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. It was on the fire escape outside the bedroom window and the neighbors above and below are not smokers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Neither was the victim. Not with pearly whites like these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if our killer had time to grab a smoke then this wasn’t a B and E. Our killer was lying in wait, which means this was premeditated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s the dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dog’s gone. Might have been scared off by the gunshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or, like Lassie, Sparkles is out there trying to track down our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? Lassie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Someone has to provide us with out of the box thinking now that Castle’s not around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. But I’ll take it from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? What are you doing? You know that you’re not allowed to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I am. Because I’m no longer Richard Castle, ordinary citizen.  I am now Richard Castle, Private Investigator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got your PI’s license? Without telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I took an online course. Finished last night. Are you surprised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can we talk? For a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, a PI’s license doesn’t change anything. The DA’s still not going to let you investigate with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you see, that’s the brilliant part. I’m not going to be investigating with you.  No. Instead, I’m going to conduct my own parallel investigation alongside yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nice try, but you know that’s not going to fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it will fly.  You see, as a licensed PI –  – I’m legally entitled to investigate this case on behalf of my client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah. So who’s your client?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m sorry, that’s confidential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but so is this investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s fine. I’ve already seen everything I need to here, anyway. I’ll conduct my investigation elsewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Elsewhere, where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that’s confidential, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is he serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think he is. And I think I’m getting a headache. Um … Ryan, see if you can get ahold of this building superintendent. Look for any security cams. And try to reach out to her next of kin. Espo, you and I should go to the school she worked for, see if they can tell us anything else about Shana’s life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You really didn’t know anything about this PI thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I mean, I saw him spending hours on the computer, but I just figured he was playing TerraQuest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, there’s not much that I can do. Look, I know that he’s doing this to spend time with me and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I don’t know. Maybe it’ll be harmless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Harmless?  This is Castle we’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, but he knows nothing about the case. Or the victim. So how much trouble can he be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re about to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. How did you get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it turns out the subway really is faster in morning traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I mean, how did you get here? To the school? Where Shana worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Well, the neighbors didn’t know very much. I figured her work would be your next stop.  So, I’ve heard about this place. It’s the feeder school in the city. They only place to be if you’re three years old and connected. Isn’t that Spaulding Elliot over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The state’s top prosecutor. He’s on the short list for Attorney General.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And behind him, James Kahlman, internet billionaire.  Even spotted Diddy in the carpool lane. No, this place is a bastion of the city’s elite. Wonder what our victim did here. What foul schemes she was tangled in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, uh … Castle. You can’t just follow me inside and sit in on my interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well actually, um … I was here first, so really you’re following me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ANGELA MATTHEWS</speaker><content>Shana was our admissions director. Parents, kids … everybody loved her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did she seem to you recently? Any changes in her behavior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If acceptance letters went out, does that mean rejection letters went out as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, maybe this year it did. There’s something you guys have to hear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BRIAN WHITMAN</speaker><content>You think you can ruin my kid’s life, b*tch? I know where you live, and you’ll never see me coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This was left on Shana’s voicemail a few days ago and pretty much describes what happened to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Matthews, do you recognize this voice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, check with the rest of the staff, see if anyone else does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll also need copies of the school’s phone records as well as a list of parents that received rejection letters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could I get a copy of that list, too?  I’m going to take that as a no.  Can’t say that I’m shocked. A group of powerful people not used to hearing the word no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. You think that rejection from preschool qualifies as a motive for murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With a feeder school like this one? A rejection from here could mean not getting into the “right” elementary school, which affects high school, which affects college and oh my god. No, people do insane things for their kids. You’ll see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you off to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Back to the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look Castle, if it was my choice –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, please. Why would I want to go the precinct? No, a PI’s work is done in the field and I’ve got lots of leads to follow up on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll see you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So unfair!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>A private investigator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I swear, sir, I had nothing to do with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Yet he showed up at your crime scene. Let me remind you, the DA was very explicit. Ever since he worked that case with the mob Mr. Castle can no longer take part in our investigations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not. I mean, technically he’s conducting his own investigation and since he’s licensed legally there’s not much I can do to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay, Detective. But let me be perfectly clear. You cannot help him either.  And that goes for you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No sharing of information, no granting access, nothing. Or there will be hell to pay. Understood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> How much trouble can he be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trust me, once he finds out that he has to work this case without me he’s going to get bored and he’s going to move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He found our victim’s school without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, but that was easy. He doesn’t have access to financials, to phone records, to street cam footage. I mean, how far is he going to get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know what would really suck? If Castle solved this case before we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that is not possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but what if he did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we’d never hear the end of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, no. You’d never hear the end of it. You’re the one who has to go home to that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, there is no way that he can solve this case before us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, who are you and what are you doing with a dead woman’s dog?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>You get the drop on me? You don’t know who you’re messing with.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Who are you? Why are you following me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t … answer … can’t … talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. My name’s Richard Castle and I’m – oh, I can show you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pepper spray? Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>I thought you were reaching for a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I was reaching for my PI license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>You’re a PI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Oh man, I’m sorry. Come here.  I was mugged last week. You can’t trail people like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.  I’m looking into the murder of Shana Baker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Whoa. Hey. Shana’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>She was my friend. Hey. Who killed her?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Brian Whitman. Senior partner at Tensor Capital. We traced the threatening call to his office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guy’s a big shot with even bigger anger management problems, including slamming his Tesla into this drive who cut him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyone at the school recognize him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, but I had unis show his picture around Shana’s building. The same day he left that voicemail neighbors saw him banging on her door yelling obscenities. He promised he’d be back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BRIAN WHITMAN</speaker><content>So I was a little aggressive when Ms. Baker didn’t let my son into that school. But that doesn’t mean I killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> “B*tch, I know where you live and you will never see me coming.” That sounds like a death threat to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>I was being dramatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How were you being when you shot her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content> Look, you don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And neither will a jury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>I had no reason to kill her. She changed her mind about my son. She decided to let him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Whitman, we have the school record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>This just happened two days ago. Called down there. You can check. I even have the letter she wrote me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your son had already been rejected. So why would Shana change her mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. She just did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whitman’s alibi checks out. He was on an investment call to Hong Kong at the time of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And the school verifies his claim. Shana did reverse her decision on his son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you think she gave into Whitman’s threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. The headmistress said that Shana would never cut a deal. If she felt threatened she would have notified the school or the police. Unless there’s more to the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s dig into Whitman, see if there’s anything else that connects him to Shana. He’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, it looks like our victim might have been hiding something herself.  According to this bank statement, she withdrew $3,000 in cash from her account the day before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I take it that’s not her normal pattern of withdrawal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. In fact, it nearly cleaned out her savings account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what would Shana Baker be doing that she needed that much cash?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Shana was going out of town. That’s why she wanted me to keep Sparkles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m assuming you’re better with dogs than you are with people. Where’d she go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>No idea. In fact, the whole thing was sort of weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Usually when I take Sparkles she tells me weeks in advance, but this was really sudden. I had to take him right away. She always tells me where she’s going, but she didn’t tell me this time. You think the trip had something to do with why she was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, seeing as how she dropped her dog off with you and the very next day she was murdered, my guess would be yeah, the two are related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>JEREMY</speaker><content>Where do you think she went?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>What are you – you’re looking at my victim’s chart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just making sure you filled it out properly. And may I say, for a man, you have exquisite handwriting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Oh, give it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look.  You could make this a lot easier on me, Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Oh, because that’s what I live for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just believe that your victim travelled somewhere before she died. Is there anything in the autopsy that indicates where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I would rather switch places with her than tell you. Now, give me that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I am warning you, Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here is it.  “Stomach contents: two ounces of peanuts, partially digested pretzels, blood contains trace amounts of over the counter sedative.”  She was on a plane. She flew somewhere.  Thanks for your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>This isn’t over!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Beckett. We’re trying to explain some anomalies in our victim’s financial records. Are there any signs that she travelled recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content> Well, as a matter of fact, I was just discussing that with the writer you married!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle was at the morgue? How the hell did he find out that our victim had left town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but Perlmutter was right about the air travel. According to TSA records, Shana took a 4:30 flight to Boston two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What was she doing in Boston?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She doesn’t have any family or friends there and I spoke to the school. She wasn’t there for work. But she paid for the trip in cash, like she was trying to keep It secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It says here that her return flight from Boston landed yesterday at 6PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just hours before her murder that night. Meaning this mystery trip might have had something to do with her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and look at this.  According to her cell records, right after she landed she made a call to the New York Ledger’s news desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s a preschool admissions officer doing calling the Ledger’s news desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe she uncovered something that she thought was a story. But I checked over there and nobody remembers talking to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve gotta figure out what she was doing during that trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we do. Before your husband does and makes us all look bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can help with that. The last charge that Shana made on her credit card was for lunch at a restaurant two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s right before she left town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She split the bill with this woman.  Nicole Morris. She’s an attorney at Harrison and Reed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s one of the top law firms in the country. Why would Shana be meeting with an attorney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. But a high-powered attorney, a secret trip paid for in cash, and a phone call to a news desk.  This is starting to smell like conspiracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I hate to admit it, but baby-Castle over here might be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Conspiracy or not, if this lawyer met with Shana just before her trip she may know something about it. So where can I find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Her assistant says that she’s out all day with some clients, but you might be able to catch her at her 3 o’clock.  Here’s the address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nicole Morris? Uh, Detective Beckett, NYPD. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I work here. Welcome to Richard Castle Investigations.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When were you going to tell me that you had an office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. We’re married.  Married people tell each other things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but you weren’t exactly thrilled when I got my PI license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because you didn’t tell me!  Now, what is she doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! She had lunch with the victim right before the victim left town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. I mean, how did you find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. I was checking the victim’s credit card for plane ticked charges – to see where she flew – and instead I found a lunch charge –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you checked her credit card records? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, we’re getting into kind of a gray area here, so let’s just say it involved her mother’s maiden name and a serviceable falsetto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Uh, I’m sorry. I have another appointment. Is this going to take much longer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be right there, Ms. Morris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Detective, so long as you’re here, would you care to sit in on my interview?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>I – I had no idea she had been killed until you called. It was quite a shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ms. Morris, how well did you know Shana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Not very. I met her a few months back when I toured Eastborne School for my daughter. We hit it off but I decided not to apply this year, so I was surprised when she called the other day. She said it was urgent. That she needed to meet before she left town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did she say where she was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Boston, I think. Something about Radnor University?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she mention why she was going there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>No. And frankly, after the questions she was asking I didn’t really want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? What did she ask about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Murder. Specifically felony statutes covering murder in the commonwealth of Massachusetts. What qualifies as accessory to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, what’s the difference between murder and manslaughter, that sort of thing. I was hoping her interest was theoretical, but … now that she’s dead maybe it wasn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Again, thank you, Ms. Morris, for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Of course. Please, call me if I can help in any way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you hear that? Felony law about murder? Do you know what this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes! That there’s a hell of a lot more to Shana’s trip than we know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And whatever trouble she got involved in up there, I bet it followed her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if that’s the case, then –  – I’m – I’m sorry, Castle. We shouldn’t be doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This. You. Me. Theorizing. Together. It’s just not right. Especially here, after this whole PI thing. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Shh. Don’t. Don’t think about it. Just think about how it feels when we work together. Besides, we have the place to ourselves. Who’s going to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t answer it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but I have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hey Espo, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you asked me to dig deeper on Brian Whitman, see if there were any other connections to Shana? Well, you’ll never guess what I found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! No, you’re right. That can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s not a coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Bring him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bring who in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, baby. I’ve got to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re not going to tell me anything?  You said married people tell each other things!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>Who the hell do you think you are, Detective? Why am I back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Whitman.  Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you’re a generous man. You support charitable causes, you sit on the board of numerous esteemed organizations, including Radnor University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So just before Shana Baker died she took a Radnor. You know anything about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>Sorry, can’t help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you can. Her trip, your position on the school’s board, and her help in getting your son into that preschool. I think those three are related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you’re going to tell us how. Or we’re just going to find out anyway. Then we’re going to take your ass down for obstruction and maybe accessory to murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not to mention what’s going to happen at that preschool when they find out you refused to cooperate on an investigation of one of their employee’s deaths. I don’t think your kid is going to be enrolled there for much longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay. Look, look, look. She came to me, okay? She wanted me to pull some strings at Radnor and in return she got my kid in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What strings did she want you to pull?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>She wanted me to contact the dean of students, tell him Shana was coming to see him, and that she needed help with something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what exactly did she need help with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>She didn’t tell me. She just asked me to make the phone call to the dean. That’s all I know. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>WHITMAN</speaker><content>So we’re good, right? I mean, my son’s still in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The dean confirmed that Shana was there yesterday requesting access to the Radnor campus police files.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Police files? Which ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He didn’t know. But according to their records room, she looked through incident reports from 1999.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Huh. Why would she be looking through 15 year old incident reports?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I bet Castle knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? There’s no way he’s ahead of us on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, he got to the morgue before us, and that lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, he is resourceful but he is not that resourceful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He got you to marry him, didn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Call him. We’ll see where he’s at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just cut him out of the case. I can’t call him and ask him what he knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then don’t ask him.  You’re a detective. Detect.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for picking up dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Didn’t want you to starve on that PI’s salary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, how’s your first case going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did I tell you I got pepper sprayed today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You say that like it’s a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Only now I’m kind of stuck. I know our victim took a trip to Radnor University, I just have no idea why. I hacked into her social media accounts –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wait, you know how to hack into social media accounts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hacking might be overstating it. Her password for everything is ‘sparkles’, her dog’s name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The point is, without police resources the best I can do is go through her friend’s online posts and look for some connections to Radnor University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are there any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just one thing. But it happened fifteen years ago. I have no idea if it’s even relevant. I just wish I knew what Beckett had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle Investigations.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I have to find out what.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, hey there. You’re home early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. I couldn’t wait to see you. So, I picked up a bottle of wine on the way home. It’s your favorite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- such a big glass. What’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No occasion. I just figured this would be a great way for you to unwind after a long day of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so nice. And where’s your glass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, it’s over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, why don’t we top that off for you, shall we? Once we get all nice and relaxed, unwind –  - there we go, you can tell me all about your day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  Wait a minute. You’re not trying to ply me with wine to find out what I know about this case, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course not. That’s not what you’re trying to do, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Because if you were trying to find out what I know, that would mean you’re stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am not … stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. Because I’m not stuck, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you do know something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you do know something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, this is crazy. If we both have something, why don’t we just trade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I can’t. You know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, can’t. What happened to that rebellious girl with the leather jacket and the motorcycle. Would she say can’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> She enforces the law now and drinks expensive wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then think about our victim. Are you really going to let a couple of silly rules stand in the way of bringing Shana justice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. We’ll do it just this once. For her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ll go at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shana had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was looking into old police records at Radnor University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, she had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University? How long ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fifteen years. His names was Jeff Whelan. He drank too much at a party and fell out of a window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If she was looking into old police records –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- and interested in homicide law –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- she must have thought that his death was more than just an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was investigating a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And somehow that got her killed.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last night was amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, are you talking about the put-together we did on the case, or …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That.  But the put-together, that was pretty amazing, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. It’s been forever since we tried that.  I forgot how creative you can get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, we’re not talking about the case anymore, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Uh uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Ryan.  Great. Okay, how long before the files –  – before it gets there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Before what gets there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were about to say ‘files’, weren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, you texted Ryan last night about Shana’s old boyfriend and told him to get those old police files for you, while you were in bed with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I –  – Ryan, I’ll be right over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you’re going to let me take a look at those files, right. I mean, that’s only fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. I can’t. That would be … crossing the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t seem to care about lines last night. No, last night it was anything goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, Castle.  And it was great.  Come on. We both know it was just a one-time thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I thought we had something special.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that the file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And it looks like your 2AM hunch paid off. What were you doing up so late, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was working on the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh. Well, I don’t know what Shana was looking to find in that report, but it refers to witness statements taken at the party where Shana’s boyfriend, Jeff Whelan, died. But the witness statements, as well as the list of people who gave them, they’re all missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The file’s been tampered with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It looks that way. Called over to Radnor, they said those pages must have been lost when their records were digitized ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the officer who wrote the original report?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Passed away a few years back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if the information is missing then what did Shana learn from this report that got her killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to the guy in the records department, when Shana finished with the archives she asked for directions to the alumni office. I placed a call over there, but they don’t open for another half hour or so. Oh. How’d it go with Castle last night? Is he ahead of us or behind us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, we’re definitely on top of him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I thought you became a PI to work with Beckett. When did it become a competition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When she took something beautiful that we built together and shared it with another man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Investigatively speaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But, I may have found a way to catch up. I have been looking for any mention of Shana’s boyfriend’s death, wading through newspapers, public records, and the like, and check this out. It’s from the Radnor University Daily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you notice anything unusual about this ad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That … people were ever actually afraid of Y2K?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, that, and the ad is above the fold. I worked on my school paper. That’s layout 101. You never place an ad above the fold on the front page. Unless something changed last minute, creating space to fill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Like the lead story was shortened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something was pulled from it just before they published. And I bet it relates to this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You could track down the reporter. See if he could tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except the story is credited to “staff”. But there is someone else who knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The person who ordered the article shortened in the first place. The editor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Frank Jackson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. They guy at the alumni office said that Shana came in requesting all of his contact information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Frank Jackson? Why does that sound so familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because he is now a reporter at –  – The New York Ledger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s who Shana was calling the day she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I can tell you why. Fifteen years ago Frank Jackson was president of the exclusive Tiger Claw Social Club, the organization that hosted the party where Shana’s boyfriend died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Shana called Frank as a part of her investigation. She knew that if he was president of that club he must have been at the party that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And if there was a cover up he would have been in on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then he could be our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me, Mr. Jackson? I wanted to talk to you about an article you edited about fifteen years ago about a student who died at the Tiger Claw Social Club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Sorry, I’m late. Another time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You left something out of that article, didn’t you?  Something about how Jeff Whelan really died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Who’d you say you were again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle. I’m a private investigator working the Shana Baker murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Okay. Not here. I know somewhere nearby. It’s more private.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We still can’t find Jackson. He’s not at his apartment and he’s not answering his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, put out an APB. If he’s Shana’s killer then he may try to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. That was the Ledger. One of Jackson’s coworkers said that he saw him leave the building about an hour ago with some guy who looked like Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Castle found Jackson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he has no idea how dangerous he is.  Damn it, Castle, answer. Why can’t he just stay out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When have I ever stayed out of anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, thank God. Now, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know the rules, but uh … given who I’m with, I thought we might make an exception.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I knew this day would come. When Shana called the other night, I was almost relieved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just tell Detective Beckett what you told me about why she called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It was about her boyfriend. She wanted to know how Jeff Whelan really died that night at Radnor University. Jeff was pretty wasted. He went upstairs to get some air, and the next thing I remember was the scream. Now, I didn’t see what happened, but I know Jeff wasn’t alone in that room when he fell out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think that he was murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>All I know is the next day I was pressured to change the story. I was told to take out any mention of who was in the room with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who pressured you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Someone big. He said he was just trying to protect his son’s reputation. He told me he could ruin my life. Or he could do great things for me. I was a kid and I was scared. And since the cops already said it was an accident, I figured, why ruin two lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only it wasn’t an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>By the time I realized the investigation had been rigged, I had already helped to cover up a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if you had come forward, your career as a journalist would be over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Yes, sir. I can’t hide from it anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who were they protecting, Frank? Who pushed Shana’s boyfriend out the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>The last person I told that … wound up dead.  Are you sure you really want to know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Let me get this straight. You think federal prosecutor Spaulding Elliott killed Shana Baker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The events support it, sir. According to Mr. Jackson, right after Shana spoke to him she went to confront Elliot about his role in her former boyfriend’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he’s a parent at her school, so she knew where to find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, it’s no secret that Elliott is being groomed for bigger things. So maybe he needed to silence Shana to keep her from destroying him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective, if you’re going to go after the top federal prosecutor in New York, you’re going to need more than just the word of a compromised journalist. You’re going to need bullet proof evidence and you don’t have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What if we can place Elliott at the crime scene? We found a cigarette butt with DNA evidence on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Which you’re going to match to his, how? I doubt if he’s going to volunteer his DNA if he’s guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll find a way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Tread lightly, Detective. You’re hunting big game here. And until we have a stronger case we cannot afford to attract any attention. Which means, Mr. Castle, you cannot be involved in this, at all, even in your private investigator capacity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, we never would have gotten this far without –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no. Actually, she’s right. Rules are rules.  In fact, I shouldn’t even be here right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, that was easier than I expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on … there. One sample of damning DNA evidence coming right up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sorry, Sherlock. Not this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The pros’ll take it from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>SPAULDING ELLIOTT</speaker><content>A cigarette butt? Is that supposed to mean something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It was recovered at the scene of Shana Baker’s murder. Preliminary DNA test indicate it’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>That’s not possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is, because you were there. You killed her, Mr. Elliott.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. I didn’t even know her. Why would I kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Because she knew the truth. About what happened that night at the party. About Jeff Whelan’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know that she tracked you down. And when she confronted you, you had her silenced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Okay, listen. Okay. She did track me down. She practically accosted me in front of my office the other night. And I told her the truth. That I – yes, I was in the room the night that Jeff fell, but I did not push him. It was an accident. It’s in the report.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then why did your father cover it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Because he knew that the truth wouldn’t matter. That I would be convicted in the court of public opinion just for being there. And that my political career would be over before it ever started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you swept it under the rug and then when Shana came along –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Shana? Do you think she was the first? Listen, my enemies have been circling around this story for years, and you want to why the media’s never run with it? Because there’s nothing there.  Until now. I’m being set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Elliott –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Shana said somebody contacted her and told her I pushed Jeff. They urged her to look into the truth. And then – then she ends up dead? And you find this at the scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You’re claiming someone is framing you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>I am a criminal prosecutor. Do you honestly think that I would be stupid enough to leave a piece of evidence like this behind? Look, I made my name fighting corporate greed. And my political ambitions are no secret to anyone. This – don’t you see? This – this is the perfect way for my enemies to destroy me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay. There’s only one problem with that theory, Mr. Elliott. In order to frame you, a person would have to know that you were there at that party fifteen years ago and know that Shana Baker had just come from seeing you an hour earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe there’s a simpler explanation. There is no conspiracy against you. You killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>You know, I couldn’t have killed her. Because I was at a fundraiser that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we checked into that. You got there at eleven o’clock. Shana was dead by ten-thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>I swear to you, I am being set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m afraid I have no other choice but to arrest you for the murder of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s telling the truth. Spaulding Elliott is not our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Was I not clear when I told you to stay away from this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I can see you’re upset. But I promise, in a moment you’ll understand. Jeremy?  This is Jeremy. He’s the victim’s friend and dog-sitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh, so Jeremy is some sort of a witness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not … quite. Jeremy, if I may?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh, the dog? The dog is the witness? Mr. Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just … watch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Proving this man’s innocence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Elliott, if I may.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Please – no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I remember reading in a profile of Mr. Elliott that he has a severe allergy to long-haired dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the victim’s apartment was covered in dog hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. And does this seem like the kind of man who could wait in Shana’s apartment, let alone smoke a cigarette while he did so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but, I mean, he could be faking the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>ELLIOTT</speaker><content>Please! Get him out of here before the hives start!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. I think that ship has sailed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, yeah. Definitely not faking that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So here is Spaulding Elliott arriving at the fundraiser the night of Shana’s death. Note the lack of red splotches on his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s no way that he came straight from her apartment looking like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which means Ryan nailed it before. This is a conspiracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan! You played the C card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I mean, you weren’t around. Somebody had to step up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, for this setup to work someone had to activate Shana and tell her about the cover up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. That way her death would create an investigative path that led straight to Elliott.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Setting him up for her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My guess is we’re dealing with some kind of big-money fixer. A shadowy, gun for hire, Michael Clayton type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, whoever planted Elliott’s DNA at the crime scene had to have gotten the cigarette butt from somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means they had to intersect with Elliott at some point. If we can figure out where and when –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? But I – I brought – on a silver platter -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll show myself out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We were all after the same thing - justice. Trouble is, when it came to me, lady justice had different plans. While Beckett and the boys closed in on the killer, I’d been kicked to the gutter like yesterday’s trash. It just didn’t seem fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right. It’s not fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Beckett. I was just listening to some notes that I made for the case – what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, we took another look at the cigarette butt. You know, the one with Elliott’s DNA. It turns out it had traces of barbeque sauce on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought you said you couldn’t share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t. But if you hadn’t shared then we’d still be looking at Elliott as our killer. And besides, we’ve got the place to ourselves, so who’s going to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I assume Elliott has had barbeque recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just last week. At a rib joint uptown. We scrubbed the security footage - and you’ll never guess who we found digging through the ashcan for one of Elliott’s cigarette butts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No way! That’s our Michael Clayton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Likely hired by whoever is behind all of this to befriend Shana, whisper in her ear, and urge her to investigate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who ensured we follow the trail to Radnor. Ooh. I wish I could see the look on their face when you slapped the cuffs on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, maybe you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. I got an urgent call to meet you here regarding Shana Baker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, just one final question, Ms. Morris. Who hired you to kill Shana Baker and frame Spaulding Elliott?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>NICOLE</speaker><content> What – what are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you know. That’s you, retrieving Elliott’s cigarette butt so you could plant it at the crime scene after you killed Shana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nicole Morris, you’re under arrest for the murder of Shana Baker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I always heard Harrison and Reed were a killer law firm. And now I know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Case closed.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think we’ll ever know who Nicole Morris works for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, she’s not going to tell us. But we did find several large payments wired to her account and Elliott is determined to find their source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I would be determined, too. That guy would be spending time in jail if it wasn’t for a dog named Sparkles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And a PI named Castle.  I’m proud of you. I just – I thought that this was another one of your larks, a way to kill time, but … you impressed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I kind of impressed myself. I got all sorts of ideas for my new book. Just one thing didn’t work out as planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know that if this was up to me we would be working together, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes. But since it’s not and we can’t, I was wondering how you’d feel if I … kept with this for a while?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s my answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m so going to wear this to work tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keep going! There’s something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So maybe you can use that to locate an actual client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I see something I like better already.  You care to go into the other room and … share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>On one condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hat stays on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-18"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
