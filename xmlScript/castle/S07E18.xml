<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that was interminable. How are fifteen PowerPoint presentations a unique research opportunity? You guys said crime stat briefings were fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content> Wait a minute, you guys told him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure they’re fascinating to someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my … you lied to me. I just squandered three hours of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So did we. Oh, come on, Castle. No hard feelings. I tell you what. I will buy the first round at the Old Haunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry guys, I can’t tonight. I have another security gig with my brother-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? Again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. The good news is Sarah Grace will have enough money for college. The bad news is she’ll have no idea who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So who’re you guarding this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … truth is, I’m not allowed to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you mean, you’re not allowed to say?  It’s us. Who is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Seriously, man. I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That means this goes beyond the usual pro athlete or reality star. This is someone important. Someone revered. Perhaps … the Pope. The Dalai Lama. Angela Merkel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>My lips are sealed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan! Is it One Direction? You’d tell me, right?  Are they in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, they’re in Hong Kong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, how’s my sister doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>FRANK KELLY</speaker><content>Sleeping easier, now that I’ve retired from the force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You don’t miss the job at all, working vice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Nah. I was dealing with lowlifes every freaking minute. Now I’m my own boss. I’m telling you, Kev, security is a better way of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I have to say, a lot of guys, when they retire, they just drift. But you’re really making this work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>You could make it work for you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Anyhow, there’s a permanent spot for you, with me, the minute you make the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wow, Frank.  That’s a hell of an offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>With your background I’d be lucky to have you. Now tell me, did you memorize the rogues' gallery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every face.  So what’s the threat level here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Low. It’s a charity event for Pure Water Now, it’s not a middle east peace conference. There’s going to be protesters wanting to bother Congressman Lopez. You’ve heard of him, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Who hasn’t? He’s a rising member of the House, super charismatic. Though let’s face it, there’s not a hell of a lot of competition in that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>He’s still a standup guy. Every time he comes to the city he hires me, so treat him right. He’s going places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEX LOPEZ</speaker><content>What’s our ETA, Frank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Just a few more minutes, sir.  Detective Kevin Ryan, Congressman Alex Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Frank speaks very highly of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> As he does of you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Please, call me Alex. Or Mr. Lopez if you want.  My wife, Mia. You’ve met my Chief of Staff, Megan Brooks. Kevin, what do you think your job is tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>To protect you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Mostly it’s my reputation you need to protect. These days a single photo can cause major damage if some idiot approaches, tries to create a scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’ll make sure that doesn’t happen, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Good. Because come campaign season I may need some men I can rely on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>MEGAN BROOKS</speaker><content>Sir, about tonight’s schedule. It’s the red carpet and then mingling over cocktails. Uh, these are the people you’re going to want to connect with. Some of them you know, all of them are major donors with their own super-PACs still looking for a candidate they can believe in. I’ve broken down all their past campaign contributions and net worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>I hope all these rich guys are ready to fork over some money to Carolyn and her Pure Water project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>MIA LOPEZ</speaker><content>Well they are, darling. But the real reason they’re coming is to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Okay, after meet and greets you’re going to take the stage and introduce Carolyn, and here is your speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Excuse me, folks. We’re pulling in now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BREE COLTON</speaker><content>Congressman Lopez, is there any truth to the rumor that you’re launching a presidential campaign?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>No, Bree, tonight is all about my very good friend Carolyn Decker and her Pure Water project. She’s going to be providing clean water for families all over the globe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CAROLYN DECKER</speaker><content>Work that is only possible because of the support and generosity of people like Alex Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What is this, blood? What were you going to do, spray him with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>The drone strikes that he supports kill innocent children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Detain him and get him out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CAROLYN</speaker><content>Nice work. You might find yourself protecting the first Latino president of the United States.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>JIM BOYCE</speaker><content>Ha ha ha … there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Congratulations, Jim. State Party chairman? It’s a great fit for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BOYCE</speaker><content>Well, thank you for all your support, Alex. You know I’ll have your back when you make a run for that White House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Little too soon for that kind of talk, but I appreciate the thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BOYCE</speaker><content>Enjoy your evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Likewise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Mr. Sheldon, it’s a pleasure to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CARL SHELDON</speaker><content>You’re being very coy about your aspirations, Alex. But you obviously have some or you wouldn’t be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Well now, I’m just happy to serve the people of my district.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>SHELDON</speaker><content>Being coy isn’t in my nature. You and your ideas aren’t what this country needs. And I’ll see to it that you never become president.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Nice talking to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Oh, Aryana Jones, this is Alex Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Aryana, my wife and I are huge fans. Can’t wait to see the performance tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>ARYANA JONES</speaker><content>You are too sweet, Alex. Please come say hi after the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Uh, sir? Five minutes until you’re on. You better get backstage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.  Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Give me some room, fellas. I’d like a word with Carolyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Man, Lopez is a rock star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re telling me. All right, I’ll keep eyes on him on stage. You got him back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, copy that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content> God, I think I’ve been hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sir, stay right where you are. Help’s on the way, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Carolyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Carolyn! You’re going to be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Kev? Kev, what the hell happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Call 911! We need a doctor in here right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Who did this? You see who did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. No, no, no, no.  Stop! Grey suit! Stay right where you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD! Stop that man! Police! Move out of the way, move out of the way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>SWAT MEMBER</speaker><content>Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The shooter’s getting away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>SWAT MEMBER</speaker><content>Put the gun down now or I’ll shoot!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, how’s Lopez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Lucky. Round hit his collarbone but missed his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How about Carolyn Decker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Still in surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I took my eyes off him for one second –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No, no, no, Kev. We are going to find this shooter. NYPD sealed off ten square blocks from this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did we get a description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Only the one you gave us. Six feet, medium build, brown hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Come on, no one saw his face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Yeah, they did. But they were too busy panicking to remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Look, why don’t we walk through what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, Frank, I already did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>And what’s the harm in doing it again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay. Shots rang out. Three of them. I – I dove on Lopez, took Carolyn down, too. Saw they were hit, that’s when you came in –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>- and then I spotted the shooter. I only ever saw their back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>All right, think about his hands. Rings on his fingers? A watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, no. Wait. Uh … blue card. Yeah, he had a pale blue ID card hanging from his neck. This guy had a press pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Kev. That’s good. I’m going to brief NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bad news travels fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, not really. Can we talk later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no. Kev, this can’t wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, I have to work this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, it’s a homicide now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m at the hospital. Carolyn Decker just died in surgery.  Kev? Are you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I read your statement. We should talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, no. There’s no point. I never saw the shooter’s face, but hey. Have you talked to Lopez yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The shooter was in his line of sight. If anyone saw him it was Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. I’m on it. I’ll call you as soon as I know something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m sorry sir, this area is off limits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I’m very sorry, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Kev?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.  Any luck on that press pass? Who’d it belong to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean, no one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Event security kept extra passes on hold for last minute attendees. Somehow our shooter got ahold of one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So how’s Ryan doing? He knows it’s not his fault, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it happened on his watch, so for Ryan it means it’s all on him until he finds this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JIM BOYCE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, Jim Boyce.  State party chair. This whole thing is just terrible. Is there any news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just that we’re doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BOYCE</speaker><content>Well, I’m glad that you’re the one handling the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Mr. Boyce, do we know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BOYCE</speaker><content>No, but you have an outstanding reputation and it’s gotten the attention of the people in my world. I won’t hold you, Detective. Pleasure to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Likewise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>Maybe we can set up a foundation in Carolyn’s name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>Yes. Let’s do that. Like a scholarship fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Why don’t I look into that and get back to you with options?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>That’d be great, Megan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Congressman Lopez, I’m Detective Beckett, this is Mr. Castle. We’re investigating the shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>You know, as a politician you know in the back of your mind that harm may come to you. But it should never come to an innocent bystander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Congressman, did you notice anything or anyone suspicious prior to the shooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content> Everything seemed normal.  Until it wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we believe that the shots originated from the north end of the backstage area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the direction you were facing when you were speaking with Carolyn Decker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you notice anyone in the background?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>I saw … stage hands … production crew … there was this one guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was he wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content> A grey suit. Is that him? Is that the man who killed Carolyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see his face? Can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>I can most definitely describe him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is our guy, Eric Chambers. French blogger and political activist with some pretty extreme ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, he looks like the sketch. But can we place him at the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>CSU pulled Chambers' print off the wall, so he was there. It was definitely him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m guessing he’s not a big supporter of Lopez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s an understatement. Two weeks ago Chambers ranted on his blog about how Lopez posed a threat to the American way of life and that he would get what all traitors deserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s Chambers now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His last known address was in the Bowery. Tactical’s gearing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Take Ryan. He should be there when you pick Chambers up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tactical’s about three minutes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How do we know Chambers is at home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tory pinged his cell. He’s in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, bro. We’re going to get this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s on the move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Chambers, freeze! Chambers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Give me a reason!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Eric Chambers, you’re under arrest.  We got him, Ryan. We’re good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Chambers, you are facing charges for murder and the attempted assassination of a congressman. Your best hope for leniency is to confess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ERIC CHAMBERS</speaker><content>I’ll never confess. I won’t give you the satisfaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, why don’t you consider this a chance to tell your side of the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>My side of the story is that I’m innocent. This is all a charade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The evidence would suggest otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found this stolen press pass at your apartment along with a floorplan of the ballroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then there’s the pesky issue of you fleeing after firing the shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>A true patriot, by definition, is an enemy of the state. Our government has a long and sorry history of persecuting people like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you are the victim here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>And you’re the instrument they’re using to try to destroy me. You’re too blind to see that this is a script. You’re just playing your part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ok – okay. Here’s the part that fascinates me. You hated Lopez, you wanted him dead, so you shot him. Not fatally, it turns out, but still, you struck a blow for –  –“true patriots” everywhere. Isn’t this the proudest moment of your life, Eric? I mean, why not own it? Why not take credit for what you’ve accomplished?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want your day in court. So you can have a public forum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content> I’m done here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Chambers isn’t talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, that may not matter. I think we literally just found the smoking gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get this: unis found a .38 caliber pistol in a storm drain about a block away from the hotel. Recently fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Weren’t there metal detectors at the venue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, which means the gun might have been waiting for him, stashed at the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Along with the press pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that suggests he wasn’t acting alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Lopez might still be a target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll call down to the hospital and beef up security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If we can reconstruct Chambers’ movements from the venue we might be able to figure out how he got that gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who he was working with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, when we were trying to ID Chambers we rounded up hundreds of photos from that event. I think I know where to start.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Some were taken by photographers, others by guests on their cell phones. I used facial recognition to try and search for Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>He appears in fourteen pictures, mostly in the background. Since each photo is time stamped, I was able to plot his movement at the venue.  Each dot represents where Chambers was photographed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Does anyone in the photos ever hand him something? Does he ever retrieve an object the size of a gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I’m afraid not. But there is a five minute gap when Chambers is unaccounted for.  This is the last photo before the missing time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That door leads to a storage area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Then maybe that’s where the gun was stashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. No, no. Security protocol would have had that door locked for the evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Well, this room wasn’t locked. Here’s another picture of it taken around the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That guy works for the hotel. That door was supposed to be locked. What was he doing in there?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Julian Bailey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>JULIAN BAILEY</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You mind telling us what you were doing in the storage room last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content>I wasn’t in any storage room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh? Then who’s this? Your evil twin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content>Okay, yeah. I snuck in there for a girl, you know? We were going to meet up, but she never showed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Have you seen this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content>Yeah. He came in the room. I wasn’t supposed to be there, so I hid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What was he doing in the room? Was he looking for something? Did he have a gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content>A gun? No. He was with another dude. They were talking all intense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CARL SHELTON</speaker><content>We have to be smart about where and when we bring Mr. Lopez down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>I’ve got it covered, okay? Lopez is going to get what’s coming to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you didn’t think to mention this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content>I was afraid I’d get fired. Besides, by the time I’d realized he was the one who shot the Congressman you guys had already caught him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, this other dude that he was talking to, did you see his face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>JULIAN</speaker><content> Just for a second as the two of them were walking out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Carl Shelton? As in, billionaire industrialist Carl Shelton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And he’s no fan of Lopez. I saw Shelton tell Lopez to his face that he would never become president.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Shelton wanted to make sure so he colluded with Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s starting to look that way. Especially since Shelton is co-owner of this hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he would have access to a press pass and know how to get a gun past security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s money versus power. Tycoon versus politician. A story as old as America itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let’s try and find out what the connection is between Eric Chambers and Carl Shelton.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>I’m afraid Mr. Shelton does not know anyone named Eric Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we have a witness that saw the two of you talking to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>That witness is mistaken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Shelton, you financed a group called America for Americans. It’s co-founded by Eric Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>My client –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CARL SHELTON</speaker><content>I fund many grassroots organizations who share my concern about the decline of this great nation. But I’m not acquainted with every person in every group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Eric Chambers' views are hard to miss. He advocates armed resistance against what he calls the US police state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>SHELTON</speaker><content>Well, there’s nothing wrong with ordinary Americans defending themselves against government overreach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, this isn’t about overreach. This is about you getting rid of a politician who stood against you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>SHELTON</speaker><content>Well, what is that, Mr. Castle? Your latest work of fiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>I believe that concludes our interview.  If you have more questions get a subpoena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Shelton, you put Chambers up to this and I intend to prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>SHELTON</speaker><content>Good luck with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s up, bro? Everyone’s gone. What’re you still doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on. This is a win. We got the shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What about Shelton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll build a case against him. And I bet that Chambers will help us out and roll on Shelton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why hasn’t he done that already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe Shelton made Chambers some promises in return for him keeping his mouth shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why would a man in Shelton’s situation risk being seen with Chambers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because. He’s like all these other rich sons of b*tches who think they can get away with anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I don’t know. Something about this just isn’t sitting right, Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re spinning. You just need a good night’s sleep. In the morning everything will be clear to you.  All right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Great. How about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That looks good.  Oh, good. You’re here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is this? What are you guys … doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Well, Ryan was working all night and he texted me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You texted Castle and not me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, when you have a crazy theory you don’t call the voice of reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eric Chambers is not our shooter. We got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You’re telling me Eric Chambers is not our shooter? Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Physics, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Congressman Lopez said that when he talked to Carolyn Decker he saw Chambers by the far wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Which is where CSU found his prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seconds later our assassin opens fire. Three shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> The first one strikes Lopez beneath the left clavicle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The second one grazes Carolyn Decker’s shoulder and then the third one strikes her in the upper back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That shot severs her pulmonary artery. She never has a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>How does any of this lead you to think that Chambers is not the assassin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chambers' vantage point. He had a side angle view of Lopez and Carolyn Decker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So how did Chambers manage to shoot Carolyn in the back? The answer is that he couldn’t have. Not unless that bullet took a hard right turn in midair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means the shots were fired from the grassy knoll. Metaphorically speaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, do you actually find any of this plausible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir. Plausible enough that I’m getting ballistics to reevaluate the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Chambers had motive. He stole a press pass. He fled the shooting. How do you explain all that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think Chambers was set up to be the fall guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably by Carl Shelton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then why isn’t he vigorously protesting his innocence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chambers distrusts authority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he believes that we’re part of a plot against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Nonetheless, Eric Chambers remains our prime suspect unless proof comes in that he isn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>In the meantime, sir, I’d like to take another run at him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content> You’re wasting your time. I’m not talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, that’s okay. You don’t have to talk. You can just listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We know that you’re not the shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>Of course you do. You people orchestrated the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, Eric, I got a news flash for you. You’re not the focus of some big governmental conspiracy. No one has the least bit of interest in you. Actually, I take that back. Someone is very interested in you. Whoever set you up. Somebody went to a significant amount of trouble to frame you and now … now you know too much. You’re a loose end. I don’t see a very bright future for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>You honestly expect me to believe a word you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah, it’s up to you. It’s your life.  Just tell me everything about how you got backstage and I’ll keep you safe. If not, I can’t help you. Nobody can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just think about it.  Um, but don’t think too long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CHAMBERS</speaker><content>Wait.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if Chambers isn’t our shooter then what was he doing backstage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He wanted to make a political statement by confronting Lopez during his speech in front of the cameras. That way he knew that it would blow up on the 24 hour news cycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Carl Shelton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, it’s looking like Shelton may not be involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The billionaire industrialist with his grubby hands on the levers of power? Of course he’s involved! They were seen in the storage room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s because Shelton realized that Chambers has crashed the event so he tried to talk him out of making a scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where did Chambers get the press pass from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Left for him. In his mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In his mailbox? By whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>An anonymous sympathizer contacted him through his website, left him the pass and instructions about where to wait backstage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, can I – can I just say, I know I have occasionally theorized that a conspiracy was afoot –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Occasionally?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- but this time a conspiracy really is afoot. Guys, Chambers was clearly being manipulated by a person or persons unknown into being backstage so he’d be the perfect patsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would someone go to all that trouble to set him up as Lopez’s shooter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I may have an answer for that.  Prelim ballistics reports. You were right. The shots did not come from where Chambers was standing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where did the shots come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, based on trajectories the shots were fired from this position right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The shooter was behind the lighting stanchion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why no one saw him. He took his shot and then he slipped out the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s good concealment; no one would be able to spot him. But check out this angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Carolyn Decker’s blocking Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That would explain why the assassin missed Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless he didn’t miss him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Exactly. Carolyn Decker was almost square to the shooter and she’s the one who got hit center mass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, what if we’re looking at this the wrong way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Carolyn Decker’s the real target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, we’ll dig through her life, see if anyone had motive to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>There’s something you should see first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>This is from Eric Chambers' building. I was reviewing it to piece together his timeline when I saw this. He goes straight to Chambers' mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that is definitely not the mailman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He must be leaving the press pass for Chambers. When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Three hours before the shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can we get a look at this guy’s face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Not a good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s my brother-in-law. That’s Frank.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Are you sure that’s Frank Kelly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah. No question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, I know this is hard but … where was Frank during those shots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>All right, I’ll keep eyes on him on stage. You got him back here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He was on the other side of the curtain. He went into the ballroom to cover Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you see him out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So you don’t really know where he was. After the shots, how soon did he arrive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ten seconds, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Long enough for him to get from the light stanchion to where you saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what are you saying here? That Frank killed Carolyn Decker? Why would he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t know. But we need to consider the possibility. At the very least he was involved. So we’re bringing him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good. Because you know what? He’ll tell his side of the story. There’s an explanation for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m sure there is, Ryan. And it would make us happier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guys, this is my brother-in-law. There’s no way he could be mixed up in something like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, bro. I’m sorry to say that unis just tried to pick up Frank. As soon as he saw the patrol car he bolted. They lost him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Issue an APB. See if there’s any connection between Frank Kelly and Carolyn Decker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m going to go find Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thanks, Javi, but this is family here. I’ve got to do this one alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I need to talk to Frank, Gwen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>GWEN KELLY</speaker><content>He’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where is he, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>Kevin, don’t you walk in here and start pointing fingers at your own family!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He ran! Why would he do that, Gwen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s he into?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>Nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know that look. Yeah, that’s the look you used to get when you’d sneak a cigarette and lie to mom about it. Look, Gwen, I’m here for you but I need to know the truth. What’s he into?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>Things were tight last year. You know, both kids are at Saint Margaret’s now, and that costs an arm and a leg. But then some money started coming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>From where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>Frank said that he was picking up extra work, but he never ran it through the company. It was always cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How much cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>Over time … close to fifty grand.  Kevin, you know Frank! You know he would never hurt a soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, then tell me where he is before he’s the one who gets hurt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any word from Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no. Not yet. It’s gotta be tough. Frank is like a brother to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe Frank isn’t in this as deep as we think. Esposito still hasn’t found anything connecting him to Carolyn Decker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, neither have I.  I hate this part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Going through a victim’s effects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Especially a purse. Everything in it is just so intimate. It’s like you get a chance to see who a person really is. Or was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who was Carolyn Decker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, she was um … a workaholic. The daily alarm on her phone is set for 4AM and her calendar shows that she was completely dedicated to Pure Water Now.  She has that handwritten letter from a little boy in Africa in her wallet thanking her. His village was almost completely wiped out by cholera, and then once they set up the water filtration system in the village, nobody died. She was actually making a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You know, you make a difference too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, not like her.  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s got a second phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Motive for murder.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Not what you’re thinking, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s a nice touch, when you acted all surprised when I remembered Chambers was wearing a press pass. I mean, you weren’t surprised, Frank, because all along it was you who gave it to him.  You hired me for this job because you knew that I would never suspect you. You knew you could steer the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No, no. It wasn’t like that. And nobody was ever supposed to get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell does that even mean? Carolyn Decker, she’s dead. I blame myself. All along it was you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Kev, I got myself into something and I can’t get myself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How could you do this? How could you do this to Gwen and the kids? Look me in the eyes and tell me, did you kill Carolyn?  Did you know her? Did you do it for the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I didn’t kill nobody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You had to have done something, Frank. Where’d you get all that cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>The security thing –  – ain’t going as good as I said. Times are tough, you know? I needed money so I made some cash on the side … by selling access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What kind of access?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> Slipping people in backstage at a concert, passes to fringe journalists, you know, who can’t get in the front door. I swear to you, I didn’t know that press pass was going to Chambers. I’m just trying to provide for my family. For your sister. I thought of all people you’d understand that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who paid you for that pass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No, I told you everything I know. And that’s all you’re going to get, because we both know what happens to cops in prison.  I ain’t turning myself in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Frank!</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well. Going to be a lot harder on my sister.  But at least Frank isn’t our shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does he know who is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. He received five thousand dollars in an envelope along with an address of where to leave the press pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who paid him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He was contacted by an outfit called Manhattan Politics. Turns out it’s a front with a dead email address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So whoever’s behind this set up Eric Chambers and used Frank to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can we trace the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No luck so far, though the bills are sequential so it probably came from a bank withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about the envelope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU pulled off a partial print, but it’s not enough to run against the database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, given the texts we found on Carolyn Decker’s phone we may only have to check one name.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>Alex will be discharged later today. And we are so grateful and humbled by the outpouring of support from all over the world. But it’s also a time of mourning for the tragic death of Carolyn Decker. My husband will honor her name by continuing to fight for the people of this country and for those whose voices aren’t always heard. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. What brings you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This. It contained cash used to buy a press pass for Eric Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>A press pass? That’s how the assassin got in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you should know. Your fingerprint is on the envelope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you during the shooting, Mrs. Lopez? Because we can’t account for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>You can’t be suggesting that I tried to kill my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no. No, no, no. We’re suggesting you tried to kill Carolyn Decker. And succeeded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. And despicable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These are texts between your husband and Carolyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Going back three years, when their affair first started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s motive for murder, Mrs. Lopez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, maybe it was purely personal, or maybe you saw her as a liability to your husband’s chances at becoming president. Either way, Carolyn Decker had to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you had to make sure it didn’t lead back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you created a narrative where Mr. Lopez was being targeted by an assassin and Eric Chambers was the patsy. A plan which happened to raise your husband’s profile on the national stage, as we just saw. Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>You don’t think I knew about the affair? I understood the deal I was making when I married Alex. And far from a liability, Carolyn was his behind the scenes advisor. She was conduit to major donors, who backed –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you during the shooting, Mrs. Lopez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>Alex and I have an agreement. I was at the hotel. Room 717. I can give you her name if it’s absolutely necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It will be. But it still doesn’t explain away your fingerprint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>MIA</speaker><content>This envelope is from Alex’s office. I know that because I ordered the stationery. I help out there sometimes. I sent letters to his constituents. I must have touched it at some point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who else has access to those envelopes?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>I’m afraid I don’t understand. So you think that one of my people played a part in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Well, that’s impossible. I personally vetted everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Once we knew where to look, we matched the serial numbers on those bills to a withdrawal from your bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>My bank account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Specifically your campaign travel account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>That can’t be. I’m the only one authorized to access the account. Just me. And Megan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is, oddly enough, the one who showed up on the bank security video making the withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>Alex, this is a mistake. I would never do this. I have no reason to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s not exactly true. We looked into Carolyn’s texts again. She had misgivings about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Carolyn believed that you could make it all the way to the presidency with the right team in place, but she didn’t think that Megan belonged on that team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The thought of being cast aside was more than you could bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you came up with a plan to eliminate your problem and win your boss the sympathy of a nation. Two birds with one stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got a search warrant to look into your apartment, Megan. The coat that you were wearing tested positive for gunshot residue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>LOPEZ</speaker><content>You killed Carolyn. Megan, how – how could you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>MEGAN</speaker><content>How could I? How could you? When you started at city council I was putting signs on people’s lawns. I was passing out pamphlets in the freezing cold. I write your speeches. I craft your bills. I have invested my entire life in you, and doing whatever it is you need me to do. And I’ve done it well. That should count for something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Megan Brooks, you’re under arrest for the murder of Carolyn Decker.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Backstabbing, adultery, and betrayal. That is why I hate politics. Representatives of the people should be honorable. They should be trustworthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure some of them are. But Washington could probably use a few more people that think the way you do.  What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, study materials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For the captain’s exam. So you’re going to go for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it’s the next step. I’m not sure if it’s the right one. Yet. But I figured I’d take the test, see how I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if you do well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Then maybe that’ll make me decision for me. You ready to go home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>What am I going to tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The only thing you can. The truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I messed everything up. Even with a plea deal I’m going to jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, you don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Gwen’s going to hate me. For lying. And for not being the man I said I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She’s strong, Frank. Stronger than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I don’t know if I should knock or just open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Gwennie. I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>GWEN</speaker><content>We’ll get through it, baby. We’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
