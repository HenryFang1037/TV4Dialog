</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>So, breakfast? Divide and conquer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll make the coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll make the omelets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>And I am going to make your day. I have the most exciting news. I just wanted to wait until you were finished doing –  – you know, whatever you were doing in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, what news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>About your wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Um … you’ve come up with options for flower arrangements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I have searched high and low trying to capture the look that is the essence of you.  I give you … the tunnel of love. The bride and groom walk to the altar through the arched passageway festooned with exotic flowers. Then, I found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that … a giant photograph?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Made entirely of flowers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yes, except it would be, of course, the two of you. Painstakingly crafted by skilled artisans. Just …  But wait, there’s more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, as much as I appreciate your passion and obviously diligent research, I just think this is a little too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>In terms of expense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In terms of –  -- everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Richard, why do you just dismiss all of my ideas about your ceremony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean like your ideas of bringing in giant ice sculptures of Nikki Heat or hiring the Vienna Boys Choir, or having the Blue Angels fly overhead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, I am simply trying to bring a little pageantry into your wedding. But it seems that the only role you want me to play is that of guest. Fine. I can do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just asked her to check into flowers and keep it simple. With her track record I should have known better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, she means well, Castle. She just wants to be a part of this. So let’s find something for her to do. Some kind of a wedding project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. You’re right. But something she can’t turn into an over the top disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll keep thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. So this building was set to be demolished. That is, until the salvage crew stripping this place came across this body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Buried under concrete, no less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not until I do a full exam, but he’s probably been here since they poured the concrete back in 1978.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A dead man from the Carter administration entombed in cement. I am intrigued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything else you can tell us about the victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He was maybe early 30s, and a sharp dresser. Check out that powder blue suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, straight from the disco era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And a testament to the truly indestructible nature of polyester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’ll check out the building back in 1978 and who owns it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll also pull permits, see if we can track down who poured this concrete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I know who the victim is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A man in his 30s with a penchant for pinky rings and Panerai watches who mysteriously vanished in 1978? C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vince Bianchi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Of the Bianchi crime family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And one of the most powerful and feared mafia dons of his day. Until he disappeared, Jimmy Hoffa style. And for over 3 decades he was right here. We just found Vince Bianchi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE</speaker><content>Vince Bianchi. Before he turned into the pile of bones you guys found. Back then, we were trying to take him off the streets. Then on July 30th, 1978, somebody did it for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> High profile case like this? Gates sure did pick the wrong week to go to a terrorism seminar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Boyle? Could one of the other crime families have had him killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>It’s definitely possible.  Mickey “The Blade” Carcano, Louie “The Lip” Maneri. Both wanted to muscle in on Bianchi’s territory, so they had motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s like being transported to a bygone era. Mickey the Blade? Louie the Lip? Where are these guys now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably under concrete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>Vince had rivals inside the Bianchi family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were any of these rivals suspects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>Yeah, this guy. Frank Russo, one of his lieutenants. He took over the Bianchi family after Vince vanished and was one of the last people to see him alive. They had dinner together that night at Gino's Restaurant. The owner snapped this picture of Frank and Vince. It’s the last known photo of Vince Bianchi. Frank claimed he drove Vince home and never saw him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you think really happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>I think Frank talked Vince into a night on the town, lured him someplace, and killed him. But we could never prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, look at the suit Vince was wearing at the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s black, it’s not powder blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he did go out after dinner that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then Frank Russo is lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to talk to Frank Russo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>FRANK RUSSO</speaker><content>Vince was a good man, God rest.  Now at least he’ll get a proper burial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Mr. Russo, we’d like to revisit the night that he disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Look, that whole thing was a ages ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, and after it happened you took over the Bianchi crime family, isn’t that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I’m legit now. I own several businesses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>MARIE RUSSO</speaker><content>Oh yeah, crumbs the family threw you when they shoved you out the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Hey, excuse me for making an honest living to keep four thousand square feet over your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s not the penthouse, is it, Frank? It’s not the top floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>What are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Why don’t you just walk us through what happened at Gino’s restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Vince and I broke bread. We shot the breeze. Vince talked about the future, settling down, how important it was for a don to be a family man. After dinner I dropped him home. That was it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you and Vince didn’t go out afterwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Again with this. How many times do I have to say it? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why was he found in a different suit then the one he wore at Gino’s Restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I have no idea. If he went out after, it’s new to me. But if he did go out, Harold would have known about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Harold Leone. Vince didn’t brush his teeth without talking to Harold.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>If you ask me, Frank’s just pointing at something shiny so you quit looking at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, that’s very possible, but who is Harold Leone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>Vince’s advisor. His consigliere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean like Tom Hagen in The Godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but after Vince went missing Harold kind of dropped off the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was he ever a suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>Nah. But word was he knew things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where can we find him now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BOYLE</speaker><content>I might have an address in my files.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me, ma’am? Hi. NYPD. We’re looking for Harold Leone. Is this where he lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>YVONNE</speaker><content>Uh, I’m Yvonne. I look after Harold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we’d like to speak with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>YVONNE</speaker><content>Are you sure about that? I mean, he’s a sweet man deep down, but he’s just a little off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Off … how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>YVONNE</speaker><content>Pathological grieving is what they call it. Harold’s best friend disappeared back in ’78 and he never got over it, never moved on. It’s like he’s frozen in time. That’s why he stays home and still owns this car and makes me wear these dumbass clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, are you saying that Harold thinks it’s the 1970s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>YVONNE</speaker><content>Yeah. And anything that happens that bursts that bubble? Oh, he just gets all confused. So when you go in to talk to him, just turn off your cell phones. Pretend like it’s 40 years ago and you shouldn’t have any problem.  Actually, you will have a problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Look at this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>YVONNE</speaker><content>Harold? You have guests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HAROLD LEONE</speaker><content>Huh?  Whoa. Well, this hot mama can be my guest all night long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sir, I’m Detective Beckett and this is Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Oh, Captain Castle. I bet you’re showing this little lady the ropes, huh? Breaking her in, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, actually, um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I mean, have you ever seen a cop with an ass that fine? If this is women’s lib, I’m all for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To be fair, you do have a very fine …  never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>So, how can I help you, Captain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, well, truth is, we’re here about Vince Bianchi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>You found him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m afraid we did. He was found in a light blue suit. We believe he went somewhere after he left Gino’s Restaurant the night that he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now we were told that he kept you informed about what he did. You have any idea where he went that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Yeah. And I know who killed him, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just to be clear, you’re saying you know who killed Vince Bianchi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>That’s a dangerous question, sweetheart.  I’m going to need protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can assign officers to protect you if necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content> If necessary.  Can you tell cupcake here that I’m risking my life just talking to you guys. The people that killed Vince would do the same to me in a heartbeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think that’s really unlikely. I mean, most of those people aren’t even around after all these years, so I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>What do you mean, years?  Vince has not been gone … for years. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sure what Detective Beckett meant to say –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Is this a trick? You are trying to trick me into saying things. Maybe Vince isn’t even dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. He most definitely is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Well then, show me. If I’m going to tell you who killed him, I’m going to see his face first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Harold, but that’s impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Why? If Vince is dead, show me his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harold –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>No body, no talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Sir, by the power vested in me by the NYPD, I will personally arrange for you to observe the deceased.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>You are a man of honor, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Can we speak outside, Captain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.  Rookies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>“By the power vested in me?” Castle, what the hell were you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was trying to stop the meltdown he had when you stepped out of the 70s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By promising him a body that we don’t have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He can help us solve an infamous gangland slaying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he’s delusional. We already know he’s delusional about what year it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we’re going to find out what he knows, he has to trust us. He has to see a body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s got something at the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what else she’s got? Bodies. Lots of ‘em. Maybe one of them looks enough like Vince Bianchi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t even go there, cupcake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This you checking out who owns that building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m waiting on a call from records, so I figured I’d study up on the period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>By starting with this documentary I found on these two NYPD badasses from back in the day.  Snookie Watts and Ray Price. Check out Snookie’s move right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>NARRATOR</speaker><content>Snookie, you and Ray have made quite a name for yourselves in the anti-crime units.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>SNOOKIE</speaker><content>You better believe it, baby. Stopping crime one skell at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RAY</speaker><content>Right on, right on. See, when the bad guys see the old red rocket here? They know a serious head cracking is on the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So … the good old days of police brutality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Man. You just don’t get it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So it looks like our victim was killed by multiple gunshot wounds. When I pieced his skull back together I found this entry wound from a .38.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One in the noggin. Classic mafia rub out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not exactly. As near as I can figure, Vince was shot in the back first. Maybe as he was walking away. There’s an exit wound in his abdomen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In his abdomen? You got all of that from bones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I got a little help from this.  When the concrete settled on him it formed an almost perfect mold. We were able to make a cast of the body, which showed the exit wound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We have a body. We have a body to show Harold. This is exactly what we need to get him to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! It’s rubber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He doesn’t need to know that.  Couldn’t a skilled mortician apply a little hair and makeup to this, make it look like a reasonable facsimile of Vince Bianchi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’ve seen them do more with a lot less. But I don’t want to be a part of some crazy plan –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have to. Because for this to work, this place has to look like the 70s.  And so do you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, Mr. Maneri, now that Vince Bianchi’s death is officially a homicide, we are re-interviewing all his former enemies, including yourself. Now, is it possible for you to tell me where you were on July 30th, 1978?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>DEANNA MANERI</speaker><content>I speak for my husband, Louie the Lip, here. And I tell you that he had no part in whacking Vince Bianchi. And even if he did, he doesn’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>LOUIE MANERI</speaker><content> What she said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>DEANNA</speaker><content>What did the doctor tell you? What are you trying to do, make me a widow? You promised the doctor not to do that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Would you two excuse us for a minute? Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>DEANNA</speaker><content>You’re going to put yourself in an early grave!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Man, I’m spinning my wheels on this thing. Everyone connected to this case is either dead or looks like Louie the Lip over there. This guy Harold might be our only shot at solving this thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, the kook who thinks it’s the 70s? No way, bro. I just got us a real lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Connected to who owns the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sort of. Turns out that back in the 70s the mob had a piece of all the concrete work in the city. It was divvied up so that different crime families controlled different parts of town. Now, the concrete that Vince was found under was smack dab in the middle of Carcano territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And the Carcanos were Vince’s chief rivals back in the day. Are any of them still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Michael Carcano. He was head of the family then and he still is today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>MICHAEL CARCANO</speaker><content>I’m only here out of respect for Vince Bianchi. And I’ll say now what I said in ’78. It wasn’t me that did him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? Because we found him under your concrete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CARCANO</speaker><content>What, I’m going to bury a body in my own back yard? Plus, if I had someone disappear they’d stay that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, they did. Until a developer decided to tear down that building. We know that you wanted in on Vince’s territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CARCANO</speaker><content>Well, here’s something you don’t know. Me and him were in talks to merge the families.  Yeah. It was a beneficial deal for both sides. Losing that merger was bad for business. So why should I want to get rid of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Maybe because you wanted the whole pie instead of just a bigger slice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CARCANO</speaker><content>If you boys have any more questions you can talk to my attorney.  You know, after this long the truth is hard to find. If I was you I’d quit looking for it. Sometimes what’s in the past should stay there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is that a threat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CARCANO</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I look ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ridiculously hot. Besides, what’s a little humiliation when you can find out who killed Vince Bianchi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>All right, so where is Vince, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Just hope Lanie did her part.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh, she did her part all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Honey, spin around. Show me that caboose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You keep dreaming, mister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What is she wearing? I said 70s, not Pam Grier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only 70s outfit she had was her Foxy Brown Halloween costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Come on baby, once you go white nothing else seems right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’d rather be dead than in end up in your bed, jive turkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, that’s enough. Doctor Parish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>She’s a doctor, too? Well, that means she sure knows her way around …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harold? We kept our end of the bargain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content> Was there anything else on him? Any of his stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>A pinky ring, a watch, and this. It’s one of those pressed pennies from Coney Island.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said that you’d talk to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Vince always carried that coin for luck. Seeing him there, I don’t know. It just hit me that he’s really gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harold, we know this is hard. We need you to help us bring Vince’s killer to justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get down!  Get down!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Did this really just happen? An attempted mob hit in my morgue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, it was pure luck that no one got hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>How’s Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle took him home. We’ve got him under police protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo Beckett. I heard what hap –  – wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Don’t you say another word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Looks like our shooter was a pro. He left by the stairs and he barred the door. He had an exit plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any witnesses see him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. But he was wearing that mask so no one got a good look at his face. But he might have been sent by Michael Carcano. Carcano just warned me and Javi off the case. Right, Javi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Check the security cameras outside the building. If we can ID the shooter maybe we can tie him to Carcano or whoever else was behind this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Nice dress.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Tory, what’ve you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>I was checking traffic cam footage near the morgue and found this. Here’s our shooter. It’s a half a block away. He must have come out the rear exit of the morgue. Now, watch. He takes off his mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Send this image to organized crime. Maybe they can ID him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So nobody in organized crime could tell us who he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but look at him. He’s from the same generation as Vince. Maybe he was even involved in the original hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Either way, organized crime said that our shooter might have been brought from out of town so that he couldn’t be linked to whoever hired him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re circulating the photo and we’ve already got an APB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s run it past FBI, too. If he’s from out of town maybe they’ll recognize him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re already on it. But what we really need is for your boy Harold to tell us what he knows.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I was a sitting duck in there! How could you let this happen? What kind of cop are you, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harold, we’re doing everything we can to bring in the gunman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>This is what I get for being a snitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, technically you’re not a snitch because you haven’t actually told us anything yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Well, they don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. They don’t. They figure you’re singing like a canary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Are you trying to make me feel better? Because this is not helping!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m trying to show you you’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain by coming clean. Tell us who’s behind this. We can go after them and keep you safe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>All right. I’ll tell you everything I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Let’s go down to the precinct and make it official.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Precinct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Yeah. The precinct. I’m going to feel a little safer with all those cops around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … why can’t we do it here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Why can’t we do it there?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will tell you why not. Because the second Harold sets foot in this place it will burst his little 70s bubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It won’t burst his bubble –  – if it looks like the 70s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You cannot be suggesting that we redecorate the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The bare bones of this place will totally work. We just need to take away the computers and put back the typewriters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! No. Absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People tried to kill Harold because he knows who murdered Vince. This is the only way we can get him to talk to us.  He’s the only lead we have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain Gates will never go for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain Gates isn’t here. You’re in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about all the other cops? Their clothes are a dead giveaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not if you, as ranking officer, order them to come to work dressed in 1970s clothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve opened an account at a costume shop – at no small expense. They’re going to help us in our little endeavor by providing 1970s police uniforms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This will be a minor disruption. We redress the squad room just long enough to walk Harold through. Let him dig on that 70s vibe and then he gives us a statement. It worked before, it’ll work again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The morgue was one room. You’re talking about an entire 70s makeover. That is a massive undertaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is why I’ve called a specialist. Of sorts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. My mother is going to come, help us coordinate –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re doing this for your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No! Of course not. A little bit, yes. Well, we did say we’d give her a project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, for our wedding. Not for my precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s face it. We cannot let that woman anywhere near our wedding. But … she will love this. And then we get to solve the greatest mystery of the disco era. Besides the popularity of disco itself. It’s a win-win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I highly doubt that.  But I don’t see a better option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are so doing the right thing. And trust me, you will thank me.  Now, take a good look around and say a fond farewell. Because by tomorrow, it’ll be the 70s.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, what is taking so long down there? Harold is ready to go and I’m running out of excuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a total fiasco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A fiasco named Martha Rodgers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s turned this into a huge production. She’s even brought in actors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She what? Would –  – would you put her on, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  Uh, Martha? Hey.  Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah.  Hi, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actors, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>In light of the abysmal talent pool you have here, yes, I’ve hired a couple of actors. And not only that, I have written these scripts so everybody knows exactly what their play is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We don’t need scripts! And we don’t need actors to play cops. We have actual cops!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That is such an ignorant thing to say and an insult to the craft of acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, all we need is to walk Harold through the precinct and into interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, I am trying to create an authentic experience here so that the two of you can crack this case. Now is that so wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Okay, Captain. Let’s get this show on the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Did you hear that, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Music to my ears.  All right, everyone! Places, please!</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Twelfth Precinct. Let’s boogie.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is more like it.  There’s the little lady. Hey, sweet cheeks. You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Stop talking, start walking.  Castle, if this doesn’t work I’m going to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about? It has to work. Look at this place. It’s amazing. And admit it. You’re having a little bit of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Hey. Most of these guys, I know.  But who are those old farts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Harold, we should –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Is that ‘sito and Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t believe you talked me into this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just play the part, man. I am, you should, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Snookie Watts and Ray Price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ah hah, that’s us, baby. What it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>You guys are legends. I’ve seen your pictures in the papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Harold. Why don’t we go take that statement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I want Snookie and Ray to do it. I love these guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, fine. Snookie, Ray, take Harold to interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>What do you mean, interrogation? I’m just going to talk these people. I’m no criminal.  I can’t believe you let this chick boss you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He can see the entire bullpen from there. The charade was only supposed to last long enough to get him to interrogation. Harold’s going to realize that this is all fake. What do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Richard. Scripts are on your desks.  This is outrageous, Officer. My behavior was entirely consensual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis? What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Gram asked me to come.  I’m playing a teenage runaway who hitchhiked her way to the Big Apple in search of her dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wearing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Halter tops were big in the 70s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So were those peasant blouses. Why – why didn’t you wear one of those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ha … we really do have fake scripts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. But Snookie and Ray don’t.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I’ve gotta tell you, I dig how you guys clean up the streets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that’s super groovy Harold, but how about we talk about Vince? Who killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>First, what is the scoop on the guy you busted? That naked Puerto Rican cat? What really happened there? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The naked Puerto Rican cat? Uh … that, um … we’ve busted so many naked Puerto Rican cats, it um … they all just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, Harold. Here’s the lowdown, brother. Yeah, yeah. Sure, me and Snookie, we book around town in the Red Rocket busting bad guys and hunting stone cold foxes, but you are going to solve the murder of Vince Bianchi. And that is something more righteous than we have ever done. What we want is to hear your story. Can you dig it?</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Have a seat, Reno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>RENO</speaker><content> I’m already seated.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you’re going to talk to this pig –  – this fuzz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RENO</speaker><content>Yeah? Why’s that, jive turkey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I’m about to make you one sweetass deal.  My God, who wrote this.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Okay. Here it is. Everything I know. Me and Vince, we were going to meet up later that night.  When I didn’t hear from him I knew something was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you knew who was behind it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content> But to get the whole picture we’ve got to talk about Glitterati.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s – what’s Glitterati?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>The nightclub. You know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>What’s that sound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh … I don’t know. What is that? What -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, Harold, you – you were telling us about Glitterati.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a nightclub, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We know that, but what does it have to do with who killed Vince?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> What do you mean, Harold? You were just about to tell us. Come on. Lay it on me, brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content> Yeah, I just had it. Glitterati.  Glitterati is the key to this whole thing.  I can’t remember.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He was this close to giving up the deets on Vince’s death, but then somebody’s cell phone rings and he lost his mojo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then help him get it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We tried, but all he can remember is that it had something to do with a club called Glitterati.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I say me and Espo take him there. Maybe it’ll jog his memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was over 30 years ago. That place probably doesn’t even exist anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Actually, it’s been though a lot of different incarnations, but guess what? It’s back to being a 70s club again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This could work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>First, the morgue. Then the precinct. And now you guys want to take him to a club? No. No. This has to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After everything we’ve already done?  We’re too close. We stop now, we walk away with nothing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It was canceled due to a bomb threat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is ironic –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, what on Earth possessed you to turn my precinct into the set of Kojak?  Oh, or should I address you as Captain Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that was so not my idea –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh, but the rest of this was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, in fairness –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And you, Detective Beckett? You know what a high profile case this is. How could you allow this circus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, given his fixation with the 70s we thought this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge about Vincent Bianchi’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And did he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … no. But –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So all this mess, this ridiculous display, and you have nothing to show for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, sir, we do. APB just snagged our suspect from the morgue shooting. He stopped at a tollbooth on the Jersey Turnpike. They’re bringing him in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>A breakthrough achieved by proper police work, not by pretending it’s the 70s! Until I can decide what disciplinary action to take, I want the both of you out of my sight.  Especially you. Now bring in Esposito and Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, they’re not here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I tell you, these clothes? That car? I feel invincible, man. Like Ray Price, kicking ass and taking names 70s style. I get it now, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah? Good for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anything coming back to you, Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, about how Glitterati connects back to Vince?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>No, no. No, not yet. Give me a minute. Give me a minute.  Hey, baby. How’re you doing, hon? That’s a nice dress. Can I talk you out of it?</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ROBERT DECKER</speaker><content>You throwing a costume party out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, here’s you in your costume after you tried to kill Harold Leone at the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>DECKER</speaker><content>That’s a guy walking down the street. That’s all I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, you seem to be walking down a lot of streets where homicides happen. Let’s see … Robert Decker. Assault convictions, manslaughter, a person of interest in six contract killings.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>DECKER</speaker><content>Look, you’ve got no proof. No witnesses can say I was there. Including you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found your gun hidden in the door panel of your car. It’s going to match the bullets fired in the morgue. I’ve got you. Now, why don’t you tell me who hired you? I’ll put in a good word with the DA.  Come on. Who hired you? Was it Michael Carcano?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>DECKER</speaker><content>I’ve got nothing to say.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you, sixty years old? So even another ten years is going to be life in prison for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>DECKER</speaker><content>Well, I’ve got more friends on the inside than the outside at this point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>DECKER</speaker><content>You guys run a real tight ship here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –  – what the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got something.  I was looking at old photos taken at Glitterati in the 70s. I found three of Vince on the dance floor boogying his heart out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so Vince went to the club. How is that news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because these pictures are taken on three different occasions and he’s always wearing the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The powder blue suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a designated disco outfit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vince must have gone to Glitterati the night that he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It might even be where he was killed because look who owns the club.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Excuse me one second.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, he just took off for a second to take a leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find him. Frank Russo owned the club back then and he owns it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>SECURITY GUARD</speaker><content>Hey sorry, buddy. If you want to see Mr. Russo you have to make an appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Oh, no sweat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Who the – Harold? Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Admit you killed Vince. Just admit it to me and you won’t suffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Harold!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Drop the gun, Harold!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Drop it, now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Where is my stuff? The booking officer made me empty my pockets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have bigger problems than your personal effects, Harold. Like assault charges, like lying to the police. Tell me something. What year is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I – don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Drop the act, Harold. Tell me what year it is. I know that you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Please stop. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What year is it, Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>It is the year I need it to be, okay? When Vince was alive and things were good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harold, what makes you think Frank Russo killed Vince?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Vince only ever wore that blue suit to Glitterati. And when you two said that’s what he had on, I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else do you remember about what happened that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Before he went to dinner, Vince told me that he needed to meet up with me later, that he had something important to tell me. And then when he didn’t show up I got worried. I – I was driving all over the place looking for him, I hit all of his old haunts, I even went to Glitterati. But there was a sign on the door that said it was closed for a private event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when you heard Vince had that suit on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I figured the private event was Frank killing him. But I knew I couldn’t go straight at Frank, not after he tried to whack me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were playing us the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>No, not at the beginning. But when I got shot at, that’s when things got real. It was like – like a bubble popped inside me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You asked us to bring you to the precinct hoping you could see what Frank looks like now. Hoping we would lead you right to his doorstep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Frank needed to pay for what he did to Vince.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I didn’t try to whack anybody. Not Vince, not Harold either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then who did, Frank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>How the hell would I know? But if Harold is saying I took out Vince he is way off base.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Vince went to Glitterati that night, yet you had it closed for an event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s your club, Frank. Are you trying to tell us that you don’t know what’s going on inside your own club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What happened that night?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>What I’m about to tell you I never told anybody. It was Vince. Vince booked the club that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Vince had the private event?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>He brought it up over dinner, said he wanted the club to himself that night. I mean, he was the boss. What was I going to do, say no? Vince goes to my club, ends up missing? If people knew that they would have thought I killed him. So I kept my mouth shut about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why would Vince want the club?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>He had been talking about settling down, getting married. I figured he was proposing to some girl. Plus, when I opened up the next morning "Last Dance" was on the turntable. A romantic favorite back then.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>He didn’t talk about her and I didn’t ask. But I knew he had someone special in his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who’s this mystery woman? Did she lure Vince to the club to be assassinated or did some romantic plan of his go horribly awry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That may be exactly what happened. I went through Harold’s personal effects. Look at what I found.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was this the item you were so worried about, Harold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s from Coney Island, just like Vince’s. Even has the same date stamped on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You carried it with you, just like Vince did. Seeing it at the morgue, it brought you to tears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You and Vince were in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content> Yes. We were. We tried not to be, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you were going to lose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-7"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Wait. You can’t be thinking that I killed Vince.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we believe that he went to Glitterati to propose marriage. He was leaving you for a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-9"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Of course he was. I was the one who told him he had to get married. It would ruin him if people found out about us. Being his number two was enough for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harold, if Vince was getting married how come no one else knew about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-11"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>It had to be kept hush hush. You see, this was more than a marriage. It was a merger. Vince was going to marry Michael Carcano’s sister and unite the two families. But he never told me that he was going to propose that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is Michael Carcano’s sister? What’s her name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>Frank’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, actually we’re not looking for Frank, Mrs. Russo. Would you mind if we came in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>Let’s keep this short. My meditation teacher’s on her way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so then why don’t you tell us what happened at Glitterati the night that Vince vanished?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>How would I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because you were there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-7"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vince had "Last Dance" playing. You thought he was going to propose. To cement, as it were, the union between your two families.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But he couldn’t go through with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You couldn’t handle the rejection. So as he left you shot him in the back, then again in the face. You know, because it was personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-11"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>You guys have quite the imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your brother knew that Vince’s murder would trigger a mob war. So he used his access to concrete to make Vince disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After that you hitched your wagon to Frank. But his tenure as head of the Bianchi family was disappointingly brief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-14"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>You can’t prove any of this. All you’ve got is a story. Now get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If it is just a story, then you wouldn’t have hired a hit man. Robert Decker decided that he didn’t want to die in prison so he rolled on you. He told us that you paid him to kill Harold when you found out he was talking to the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And here’s the funny part. Well, maybe not so funny to you. Nobody, including Harold, knew you killed Vince. If you had just left Harold alone it would’ve stayed that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Marie Russo, you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.  Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>I wish Vince had just said yes to her. Maybe then he’d still be alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he had to follow his heart. It’s probably what he wanted to tell you that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Isn’t that something? Knowing he did that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, how does it feel to be in the 2010s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>HAROLD</speaker><content>Ah, it’s okay. I’m ready to say goodbye to the 70s. Say goodbye to Vince.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, let’s do it the right way. Honor the times along with the man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, tell me you don’t mean –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, but I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="48"><utterance uid="48-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had no idea you could disco dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle. I’m a woman of many hidden talents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I look forward to discovering every single one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie! I’m digging those groovy duds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Doesn’t she look stunning in this outfit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just glad it covers more this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, thank you so much for everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was spectacular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now that you guys have connected to my vision here, perhaps we can revisit the flowers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="49"><utterance uid="49-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dig it, man. The 70s is a cool place to visit, but I would not want to live here, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You sure about that, blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, Lord have mercy. Oh, Snookie, Snookie now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="50"><utterance uid="50-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain Gates. Does this mean all is forgiven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It means I like to dance, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle, look. Look at Harold.</content></utterance>
