<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>You have 30 seconds to suit up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A game is afoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. Let me savor this. I haven’t got the drop on you since you were 10.  Oh, this feels like … victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, look. I can’t, okay? I have a big decision to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, have you at least narrowed it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I made a list of all the classes and extra circulars. And the best choices seem to be Oxford and Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Columbia? NYU? Vassar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>They’re all too close. I’d come home all the time.  I want to challenge myself. And I’d get sucked into things like this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But then who’s gonna play with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I think it’s time to holster the laser guns and be adults.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>VEST COMPUTER VOICE</speaker><content>Game over. Please proceed to exit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh, darling. It’s just a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s not. It’s a time honored family tradition that we’ve been honoring since Alexis could wrap her little finger around a trigger. First one to a thousand points wins. And we were so close. We laser tagged our way through her preteen years and now, suddenly, she’s too old to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>She’s growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well she doesn’t have to. Look at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh! Well it seems like Detective Beckett is available for a playdate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett and I have not exactly been … hitting it off lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh huh.  And why do you think that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. Are you saying that it’s my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Cavorting with some awful gang detective, showing up at a crime scene with a stewardess?  If you want to punish Beckett at least let her know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not punishing her.  I’m – Am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, darling. You’re hurt. I understand that. But quite honestly, the two of you cannot go on like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what, Mother? You’re absolutely right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To a crime scene.  Work my last case with Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Thought you didn’t like coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I like vanilla lattes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks for calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, our victim is David Locke, 29. He’s a currency trader at a foreign exchange office upstairs. Looks like he was heading into work when it happened. His body was found by his boss at around 7 o’clock this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Ah, our intrepid heroes have arrived.  And Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Perlmutter. I will treasure these special moments we’ve shared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I take it this is Mr. Locke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It appears he was set upon by an unknown assailant. Time of death was about 4AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Well, probably blunt force trauma to the head where it hit the concrete. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wallet and cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Still intact, so it definitely wasn’t a mugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Savage beating at 4AM, there must be some motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is this a bite mark on his arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It’s not just a bite mark. Look at the skin. You see how it’s torn? The killer latched on and shook like a pitbull trying to tear off the flesh – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks. I think we got it.  Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just this. It was, uh, found in out victim’s hand.  It was probably torn off the killer’s shirt during the struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s a lace cuff. Hand stitched, pearl buttons, I’d say this was circa … 1870.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did a lot of research on the era. I was writing a book. A comedy about the Civil War. Turns out, not so funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>You don’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who would beat a guy to death wearing a hundred and fifty year old shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, the bigger question is, why was he attacked here where he worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Might wanna ask his boss, Mike Matthews.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MIKE MATTHEWS</speaker><content>I can’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We think that David was killed around 4AM. Do you have any idea why he was here so early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>David handled the Asian markets, so he usually got in by 4.  He was a terrific kid. He was hard working, well liked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was that the consensus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean did he have any conflicts with anyone at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Actually, yeah, there was an incident last week. Someone keyed his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>David thought it was Charlie Coleman, one of my other traders. The two of them were vying for a promotion and I went with David. Charlie didn’t take it too well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What time does Charlie usually show up for work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>4AM. Same time as David.  Look, Charlie’s kind of an oddball, but I – I don’t see him mixed up in this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re gonna need to talk to him anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>That’s strange. His car is right there, next to David’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why is that strange?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Because Charlie never came into the office this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s his address?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s a shame. This case had real promise.  Savage bite marks, reconstruction era clothing. It’s a mystery here, a whiff of intrigue. Now we’re just slapping cuffs on some disgruntled employee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just wanted this one to be special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I’m sorry it’s not entertaining enough for you, Castle.  Charlie Coleman! NYPD! Open up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Stay away! It isn’t safe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stand back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>It’s for your own good! Don’t come in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>You can’t come in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s all right, Charlie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Charlie, are you okay? Anyone here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>No, no, no. Stay back. Stay away from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, we just gotta ask you a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>You need to leave! You need to leave right now! It’s not safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Relax, Charlie. Relax. We’re cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content> You’re a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Is that your gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>You need to shoot me. Do it now!  Do it! Do it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Charlie, you feeling better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just gotta ask you a few questions about what happened this morning with you and David. Did you see him in the parking structure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Yeah, he had just pulled in. I said hello, he said hello. The two of us aren’t real friendly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’ve heard. What happened next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>And then he stopped. And he stared right past me with this weird look on his face and he the said ‘what the hell is that?’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What the hell was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>I couldn’t tell at first because that thing was all over us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, you were attacked too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it was mostly after David. I mean, it was just wailing on him. I elbowed it in the head, but it didn’t even slow down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, what do you mean by it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>I called 911, they didn’t believe me. No one believes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just tell us what you saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>As long as you promise you’ll believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, fine. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Promise that you will use your gun on me when I start to turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Turn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean, turn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>The thing that bit me? That killed David?  It was a zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A … zombie?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>It was a zombie! I freaking zombie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>A zombie! The undead! Oh man. With those dead eyes and flaps of rotting skin coming off its face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Yes! I’m having a major emergency here! Don’t you get it? This thing just killed someone and it bit me. I’m gonna turn! I’m next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now Charlie made this 911 call moments after the attack. Does it sound like he’s faking to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It sounds like Charlie’s having an psychotic break. What if his guilt made him snap and he created a fantasy in which zombies killed David and not him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not so sure. I mean, his voice does have that authentic ring of pants-wetting terror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do not believe in Charlie’s story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe that he believes it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well whatever you believe, all the evidence points to the fact that Charlie Coleman is our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe not all the evidence.  CSU analyzed that bite mark on Charlie’s arm. It turns out it matches the bite mark on our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe Charlie bit David and then he bit himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was thinking the same thing, but CSU also says that the bite marks weren’t made by Charlie’s teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, wait … um… sorry. Let me make sure I understand, so I might properly relish this moment. You’re saying the evidence shows that Charlie and the victim both were bitten by an as yet unknown third party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s what I just said –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perhaps even a mindless, shuffling, undead third party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, just stop. There’s no such thing as a zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Guys –  You gotta see this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So I was combing through security cam footage near the parking garage and I found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Time stamp’s 4:06AM, which fits time of death. That’s our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s not Charlie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, what is he wearing? That looks like an old fashioned suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Circa 1870. And his shirt’s missing a cuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa. He almost got his by that taxi, didn’t even flinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well maybe this is why. Look what we get from the other angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My friends.  That is a zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Our killer’s a zombie.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well you’re rather upbeat considering you said this was your last case with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because I am going out with a bang. I have one word for you, Mother.  Zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Too much makeup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look lovely. I’m referring to our victim being killed by one of the walking undead. And I mean that literally. A zombie. A security camera caught him in all his putrefying glory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Whoo. I don’t suppose you downloaded this video by chance? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Absolutely not. That video is police property. It would be very, very wrong of me to … get a screen grab of it and email it to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oooh… it’ll be our little secret, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m actually surprised that you’re interested in this case, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I really do know the difference between a first rate makeup job and actual decay.  You want to see some real zombies check out the red carpet at the Tony awards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm.  I thought I – I thought I put this away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she? Where –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You were fooled by my act yesterday and now you’ve fallen right into my trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You will pay dearly for your treachery.  E tu, Mother? For luring me here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Why, whatever do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. That’s my girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So what’s this about a zombie?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Oh. My God. I told you people. That’s him. Oh, so vile and disgusting. That’s the zombie that I saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well we’re not exactly sure that he’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>What do you mean you’re not sure? What else could he be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Point is, this puts you in the clear.  We’re releasing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>I’m not sure that’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Charlie, if you were going to turn you’d have done it by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>This thing, have you caught it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not yet.  Rest assured, we will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>I’ll just stay here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He won’t leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Charlie’s pretty convinced about this whole zombie thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s just – that’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or is it? Charlie has not been wrong yet. Maybe our killer is patient zero, other there right now on the streets of New York building an army of the undead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what we are looking for is not a zombie but a very smart criminal who murdered David Locke and is now making our only witness look crazy. And he also dressed up in makeup and a costume to hide his identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless that’s not costume or makeup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I mean, he does look like a real zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A real zombie? I’m embarrassed for you, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, then explain this. Why would a zombie go after a currency trader, at 4AM, in a garage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> This one’s easy.  The more intelligent the victim, the more delicious the brains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, returning to the land of facts, what did you find at the crime scene canvass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nada. Only in New York could some guy dress like a friggin’ zombie and walk down the street unnoticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I did find a gap in our timeline before the murder. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, according to the doorman, the victim left his apartment at 2AM and he never came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was killed at 4AM. What was he doing for 2 hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. But he drove there. His credit card showed that he gased up on Houston at 2:44AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let’s figure out where he went. Trouble might have followed him to the garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or a zombie did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll tell you where he went. Booty call. Tech guys pulled a text message off David’s phone. He sent it to a chica the night he died, wanting to hook up with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does she have a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Greta Mastroianni.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>GRETA MASTROIANNI</speaker><content>I – I don’t understand. Who would do something like this to David?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you see him that night? We know that he texted you wanting to come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>No. I called him and told him not to come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>I split up with David about a week ago. He was still trying to hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why’d you two split up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content> I’m engaged. Um… to Tom.  Tom Williams. We’ve been together five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How did David figure in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>I met him when I was 21, visiting a cousin in LA. We had an intense couple of weeks, you know, and three months ago I ran into him at a coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And did you fiancé know about this affair with David?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>Yeah, he found emails on my computer last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And how did he react to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>He was hurt. He threatened to leave me and that’s when I realized what I was about to lose, so I broke it off with David and begged Tom to give me another chance. And he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So where was Tom that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>Home. We went to bed around 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And he was there all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Greta, where was Tom at 4AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know, okay? I woke up around 2:30 and he wasn’t there. I figured he was watching TV in the living room but when I got up in the morning –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He wasn’t in the apartment, so where was he all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>I see what you’re getting at with this, okay? But Tom had nothing to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did David email you from his office account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>Yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because that means that your fiancé knew where David worked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>TOM WILLIAMS</speaker><content>Look, I can’t say I feel bad this guy’s dead. But I had nothing to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Even though he was trying to snake your fiancée?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>He was out of the picture. Greta made her choice and she picked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, except he wouldn’t take no for an answer.  You know, I bet you found out that he was texting her and you decided to make him stop texting her. Permanently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content> Well, you’re wrong. I never touched the dude. I never even met him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but it had to have made you angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I won’t lie to you. This whole thing had been tough. But Greta and I are building a life together and I think we’re going to come out of it stronger –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tom, how tall are you? About 6 foot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>6’2”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So about the same height as this guy, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>What the hell is that?  C’mon, that’s not me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When you left the apartment that night, where were you for the next hour and a half? David was missing for the same amount of time, 2:30 to 4AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I was a the Hudson Law Library, studying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were at the library at that hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>It’s open 24/7 during finals. You can ask the librarian and the 10 other people who were studying there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tom’s alibi checks out. He was at the law library between 3 and 6AM.  I really thought he was our man. It’s not like David Locke has any other enemies. I mean, we confirmed that with his friends and coworkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about recently deceased friends and coworkers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Well, whatever or whoever this is, can we at least agree that he looks like a zombie, he dressed like a zombie, and he acts like a zombie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that helps us how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re looking at standard motives here. But our killer isn’t driven by revenge, greed, or power. Not if he thinks he’s a zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So by that line of thinking, his motive is a primal urge to kill?  Regardless of who the victim is, he kills at random.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Precisely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then how do you propose we find a random killer in a city of 8 million people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe we start with where the victim went during those missing 2 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well the lab ID’d a chemical found recently deposited on the bottom of David Locke’s shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of chemical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh… I won’t even begin to try to pronounce it, but it is used in 3 factories in New York and New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The night that David was killed he went to a gas station on Houston. Which one of those factories is closest to Houston?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The one on the lower East Side, but it’s been closed for over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we know now this is in fact an abandoned factory. A desolate, God forsaken alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Imagination getting the better of you, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, course not. Just wish we had more to show for our efforts, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The thing that I don’t get is why would a currency trader like David Locke come down here? It just doesn’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He had a dark side we knew nothing about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All I know is that normal people don’t come to places like this at 2AM in the morning. In fact, I think I’ve seen enough, haven’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait. Do you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not falling for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. I’m serious. Listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Footsteps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lots of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>They’re after us! They’re after us!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>They’re coming! Don’t just stand there! Run!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s – that’s a – that’s a zombie horde.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> There’s no such thing as zombies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sure I don’t have to tell you to aim for the head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett! Behind us. We’re surrounded. Oh jeez, oh jeez. You don’t have enough bullets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s ground zero for World War Z.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Get behind me. We’ll have to fight our way out. Uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s no way this is real.  NYPD! Stop moving, now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And stop pretending to be zombies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. We’re just zombie walking here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Zombie walking. It’s like an amped up form of tag. We dress up like zombies and we chase the normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>That would be us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, if we tag them we turn them and they become zombies, too. Look, if this is because we didn’t get a permit –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not. You’re all coming with me. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did I now know about this?  This is outstanding. Did you do this yourself?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Being a fan of zombie lore, I get it. But what’s the appeal of being a zombie? Like look at this guy. Who would want to be alive in a decayed, mindless state? Being a vampire, that I understand. That’s the romantic route to immortality. The gentleman’s monster, as it were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Speaking of monsters, none of these zombies match the photo of our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he’s trying out a new look.  How about you? If you could be any supernatural creature, what would it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Van Helsing, no question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Monster slayer. Befitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And imagine, the monster that we are hunting might be in this very room.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know about those shoes with that top.  Just sayin’. I would’ve went open toed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys having more luck than we are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not at all.  Oh, and guess what? None of these knuckleheads are real zombies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think what my colleague means to say is that no one recognizes our zombie from the video or our victim David Locke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If David wasn’t part of the zombie crowd then what was he doing down there?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RHETT</speaker><content>He wasn’t part of our group, I can tell you that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paul, are you high right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. Hey now. Where’s that …  coming from? No. No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Right. Um…  Yeah, yeah. I don’t know this dude. He’s not a – a zombie or a normal.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>RHETT</speaker><content>Uh, teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>RHETT</speaker><content>Assistant professor of anthropology. I believe our fascination with zombies is a cultural phenomenon. A commentary on the inner numbness of modern life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. Do either of you recognize this … uh ..  … zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>RHETT</speaker><content>That’s Kyle. Kyle Jennings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD! Kyle Jennings!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s him.  Kyle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do we have cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I assume by ‘we’ you mean me. I’ll have answers after I cut him open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>We’re all meat, Castle. Get over it.  What I can tell you is his teeth match the bite marks and the blood on his clothes came from the victim. Kyle Jennings is your killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But the question is, who killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Isn’t that always the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>What is it, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I was just … wondering. Before this man died, he was behaving exactly like a zombie. Is there any medical way to determine if he actually was … one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content> Why – why is he in my morgue? There are no zombies, Castle. This is a man. He was a live man, now he’s a dead man. End of story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s undead!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, call for backup!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How – how do I -?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>9. 9.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>9.  Is there a police code for zombie on the loose?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So based on the latest report from the ER, Kyle Jennings was transferred up to ICU. He is stable but under sedation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m telling you, that guy was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Remind me never to choke on a chicken bone in front of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey! You checked that guy. So did the paramedics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa, you guys. I’m sure there is a medical explanation for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh… there’s an explanation, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Besides that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon. You were there. You saw it. He rose from the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He didn’t rise from the dead, Castle. He wasn’t dead in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s not a zombie, Castle. He’s just a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, what was his motive for murder, Detective Esposito?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kyle sold insurance. He had no criminal record, there’s no evidence that he even knew our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s a human killer, with a human motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or he’s a zombie killer. With a zombie motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Tasty brains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, Castle, do you really believe in all this zombie stuff? Because I would swear on my Nana’s grave that Kyle Jennings was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No. You know what I do believe in? Driving Beckett crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I have to say. It’s good to see you guys hitting it off again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well Castle, it looks like we’ll get our motive straight from the source. Mr. Kyle Jennings is officially awake.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kyle, I’m Detective Beckett. This is Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>KYLE JENNINGS</speaker><content>What am I doing here? Why are there cops outside? No one’s telling me anything. What, was I mugged or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to ask you a few questions about David Locke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>I don’t know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two nights ago he went on a zombie walk. Did the two of you meet there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>I’m telling you, I’ve never seen the guy before. What is this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was murdered. Beaten to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened at that zombie walk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>I can’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what’s the last thing you do remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Uh … I got dressed to head over there. The next think I know I woke up in the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you drink or do drugs that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>I don’t do that stuff. Look, I didn’t hurt anyone, okay. I would never do that. I just – I don’t remember anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the victim’s blood was found on your clothes, bite marks match your teeth, the cuff of your shirt was clutched in his hand, and a security camera caught our killer on tape.  Is that you, Kyle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content> Yes.  That’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you’re going to need a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Kyle killed someone he never met for no reason. Is that what we’re supposed to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well isn’t that what you said zombies do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is with a sad heart that I say that man is no zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, even though he rose from the dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s common knowledge that when you turn into a zombie you cannot turn back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you concede to the fact that there’s a medical explanation to all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I concede to nothing, except that Kyle is not telling us the whole story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think he remembers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When a life altering moment occurs, people remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well maybe it’s too big to deal with. Maybe he  … can’t face it just yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well you think he ever will be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hopefully. If he feels safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-33"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I came to tend to one of my patients. Kyle Jennings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … do you think that’s such a good idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-35"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I’ll have you know I’m perfectly capable of treating living patients. I simply prefer not to. I made an exception here because the results of his blood work were quite unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-37"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Kyle Jennings had scopolamine in his system, which in small doses is used to treat motion sickness. In larger doses it acts on the central nervous system to promote compliant and suggestible behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly how suggestible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-39"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>You’ll basically do whatever you’re told.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-40"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It’s like a date rape drug, except the victims remain conscious. And when the drug wears off, they’ll have no recollection of what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it possible somebody slipped Kyle that drug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-42"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I think it’s highly probable that they did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What time do you think he was given the scopolamine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-44"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Between 2:45 and 3:45 the night of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s when he was on that zombie walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone on that zombie walk drugged Kyle and sent him after David. Kyle’s innocent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Far from an act of zombie mayhem, this murder was fiendishly deliberate. It was meticulously planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By someone with a powerful motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With access to those drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was also at our zombie walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But we interviewed those people. There’s no evidence that David knew any of them or had anything to do with the zombie scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well we know he was down there. He had to have gone there for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe our best bet is to work this through the drug angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, I got started on that and I did some research on scopolamine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Quite the list of side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech, death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it available on the street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s uncommon, but it’s out there. And get this, users refer to it as the zombie drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I know just the zombie to tell us all about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>What is this? I answered all your guys’ questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When you were here last time, what were you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content> On? What do – what do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were under the influence, Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Heavily … under the influence. Was it scopolamine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Whoa, what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you use the zombie drug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>I suppose that’s … possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do any of the other zombies use it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Some do. Some say is enhances the zombie experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>A guy I know sells the stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who? What’s his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>I don’t know. I never ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, describe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Dark hair, tall, over 6 feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is this him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks for coming in again, Tom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Sure. Though I’m not sure what I can do. I heard you caught the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, we just needed you to help us tie up a few loose ends.  So, this is our suspect, Kyle Jennings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Yeah, I remember from last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now, you said you’ve never seen him before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content> He’d be hard to miss, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s funny. Because Kyle said he saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he says you were at the zombie walk. You never told us you were part of the zombie subculture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Detective, I’m pre-law. I have no time for regular culture, let alone subculture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh Tom, you’re too modest. A number of zombies sang your praises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Apparently you’re the real go to guy for the real zombie experience with the scopolamine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content> The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a kid from Ridgewood, Tom. You don’t even have a job. And yet you manage to afford a really nice apartment and you’re able to pay your tuition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I took out student loans. Look, I – I’m – I’m not a drug dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re trying to get ahead. You know, make a life with Greta. And then she steps out with some Wall Street douche, who would just not let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>David wanted to see Greta the night that he was killed. She said no. We canvassed the area. He was seen sitting in his car outside of your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When you left that night he followed you to the zombie walk. I’m betting he told you he was going to fight for Greta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was handsome, he had money, the two of them had a history. I mean, you knew you couldn’t compete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, especially when David told Greta you’re nothing but a lowlife drug dealer. You had to take matters into your own hands. Or more specifically, Kyle’s hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you had this brilliant plan. You dosed Kyle with scopolamine, told him to kill David thinking nobody would ever figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, that last part didn’t work out so well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>All you have is the word of a few whacked out zombies. That’s not even close to probable cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, that’s all I need to keep you here for 24 hours.  And by then I will have my proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>No you won’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s right. We’ve got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing is a strong word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only person that can link Tom to the killing is Kyle and he doesn’t remember anything. And on top of all of that, the evidence shows that Kyle alone committed the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, when you put it like that… yes, it sounds a little bleak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe this is it. What every homicide cop fears.  The perfect murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.  This is not the perfect murder. Can’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not to me. Not unless I’ve written it. No, we’re just missing something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like proof.  Without it we did the only thing we could. We went at Tom head on. He didn’t blink. We’re out of moves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ve got one move left.  We went at Tom head on. Now we need to go at him sideways. And I know just what to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greta, I know how you feel. You’re in love with Tom and you want to see the best in him, but you have to look at the facts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>What you’re saying isn’t true. Okay. None of it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then take the money. How is he able to pay for an apartment in Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>Not by being a drug dealer, I’ll tell you that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about that engagement ring?  How can he afford that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content> He said it was his grandmother’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greta, you are my last chance. If you don’t help me, an innocent man is going to go to prison. For life. For David’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>GRETA</speaker><content>No.  Tom’s the innocent one, okay? You got your killer and it’s not my fiancé.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Still waiting on that proof of yours.  No? Nothing? Ah. Thanks for the hospitality. Is there a comment card I can fill out about the level of service I received?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re free to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take advantage while you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>You know, Greta told me about your little conversation. That was you big play? To use my own fiancée against me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s gonna figure out who you are sooner or later, so what are you gonna do about it then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Kyle Jennings made bail. Got released a couple of hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Wait, Kyle is out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His bail was set at a million dollars. Where did he get the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out he’s got an uncle who’s got some serious dough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’d steer clear of him if I were you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>What kind of lies did you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We didn’t tell him anything. But Kyle’s a smart guy. He’s gonna do the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I want police protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought you didn’t do anything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I didn’t. But thanks to you, Kyle thinks that I did and now he’s out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>You’re releasing me with knowledge and forethought that he could attack me. If he does, think about the lawsuit I’ll file against you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Esposito, please process Mr. Williams and then escort him to his apartment and make sure it’s clear. And after that, you are on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I’ll be sure to check excellent service on that comment card.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I want a patrol car outside the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah well, that’s not gonna happen. I’m gonna come in and let you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get down and stay in the car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD! Drop the bat and show me your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ZOMBIE</speaker><content>I know what you did to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I didn’t! I didn’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ZOMBIE</speaker><content>You made me kill a man and now I’m going to do the same to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Oh, no! Please! I … I’m very sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>ZOMBIE</speaker><content>You’re lying! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>No! I swear! He was going to take Greta away from me! I had to do something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I’m sorry I used you. Just – please. Please. Please don’t hurt me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay. Enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Huh?  Good actor, huh? I had you going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tom Williams, you are under arrest for the murder of David Locke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Wait, hang on a second. Just – Kyle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Kyle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry. Kyle couldn’t make it. But he, uh …  sends his regards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turn around.  Turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Gotta tell you, bro. Coming at me like that? You almost make me a believer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Stop it. Don’t do that. You’re creeping me out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You really nailed it, Kyle. Your costume is what sold that bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and by helping us you actually helped yourself. The DA is looking in to dismissing the charges against you now that he has Tom’s confession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Detective, Mr. Castle. I – I don’t know how to thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh.  Let me borrow the zombie outfit for another day, we’ll call it even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>You know what? Keep it. My zombie walking days are over. I just want to put all this behind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How does somebody put something like that behind them? He’s going to need therapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It helps.  First he won’t even be able to deal with it. It’s going to take everything he’s got to just put one foot in front of the other and get through the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn’t know you were seeing a therapist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I didn’t want to make any excuses. I just wanted to put in the time and do the work. But I think I’m almost where I want to be now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And where is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In a place where I can finally accept everything that happened that day.  Everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I think … I understand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And um… that wall I was telling you about? I think it’s coming down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well I’d like to be there when it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d like you to be there, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only without the zombie makeup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. I kinda think that the zombie makeup suits you, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I make it work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tomorrow.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Victory is mine. One… thousand… points. And that is the icing on the cake that has been my day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> That’s it? It’s over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? C’mon, Alexis. It’s just a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A game we started when I was 5. And it’s over. And I’m going to graduate, leave for college and I’ll be there and you’ll be here and we can play at Christmas and during the summer, but it won’t be the same, will it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But you know what?  Things change. And change is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Go that far away. I want to go away, but not that far. And I hate myself for it, because my personal motto is do the thing that you fear the most, but every time I get ready to hit the accept button on my acceptance to Oxford or Stanford I – I get all sick inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well you … follow your heart. Follow your heart and you can’t go wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And my heart is telling me … go to Columbia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But here’s the other thing. If I do this you have to promise not to drop in on me. If I do this, you have to give me my space.  Do you think you can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I can give a sincere and solemn oath … to … try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then …  Best two out of three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This isn’t over!  This isn’t over. </content></utterance>
