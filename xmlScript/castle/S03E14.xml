<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kill me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You got the cell phone bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, uh, books from my publisher for back cover quotes. Wait. What about the cell phone bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, more books to endorse. Couldn't possibly read them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don't have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"A tour de force in terror." - Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Does for hot tubs what Jaws did for the ocean."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram, here's a letter for you. Looks official.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Bachran and Sabasta. Oh, Chet's estate lawyer. They probably resolved the probate--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Just...memory of him caught me by surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Do you think he left you anything in his will?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, he certainly didn't need to, but it--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, my...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Why--</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A million dollars. Your mom must be in shock. Any idea what she's gonna do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If I'm lucky, get a place of her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that would be lucky. Can't find much in Manhattan for a million bucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Foosball, basketball, a motorcycle. The owner of this place clearly had ten times that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Try a hundred. Victim's name is Jay Hixton. He won a cool 117 mil in the Florida lottery last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then he went on a serious shopping spree. Rookie mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like the voice of experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. Writing a bestseller in college is a lot like winning the lottery. I spent every penny of it in six months. Good thing I'm not a one hit wonder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Single gunshot to the chest; from the stippling and bruising, I'd say there was a struggle. The gun went off, vaporized his heart, somewhere between eleven and two last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's a big gun. It's too big for that entry wound. This isn't the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Told you she'd spot it first off. Our victim was shot with a 9mm automatic. The bullet went straight through him. We pulled the slug out of the poker table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so maybe our killer forces Hixton to open this safe. The .357 is hidden inside. Hixton pulls it out, but they struggle and he gets shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's a winning ticket. Hard to believe a little slip of paper's worth over a hundred mil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What would you do if you won that kind of money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Easy. Buy a Ferrari.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have one. Not as great as you would think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but they're hella fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As fast as every other car in rush hour traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea how much money was in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>A hundred thousand dollars, secured in a bank bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, this is Reginald Easley. He's Mr. Hixton's servant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Servant? Young man, I am a traditional English butler. I apprenticed at Buckingham Palace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he always keep that much hard cash in the safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Mr. Hixton came from an impoverished background. He found having hard currency around reassuring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How many people knew that it was there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Dozens, no doubt. He had a habit of buying everything in sight. No thought to how much money he was flashing around or how dangerous it was to tell people that there was plenty more of it at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In New York, that's like inviting someone back to your house to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he keep that gun in the safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>That's the odd thing, Miss. I know every item in this apartment. I have never seen a gun. But I do know he kept a dye pack in the bag that was stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how was it triggered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>It was on a three minute timer that began when the bag left the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. Grab some uniforms, canvass the area. Killer couldn't have gotten very far before that pack exploded. When was the last time you saw Hixton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Yesterday evening. He left about five o'clock. I believe he had made plans with his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>REGINALD EASLEY</speaker><content>Oh, yes. With a teenage daughter. Though they'd been separated for some months before I began to work for him. Apparently, the money caused some kind of a rift.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>We were so happy then. Trips to Paris and trips to Rome and cars with heated seats and...then everyone started looking at us different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>Like we were freaks. You could see them thinking, "Why you? Why not me?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>And nothing we did was good enough. So we moved here. Was supposed to be a fresh start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why were the two of you separated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>That money, it was-- it's like poison. Jay couldn't stop spending it and...and Nicole...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>It's okay, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>Nicole got hooked on drugs. And it was the wakeup call we needed, really. Jay and I went from not talking to getting Nicole clean. And then he started using his money for good. He found this soup kitchen in the Bowery that was in dire straits, and he said that looking at all those people in need just reminded him that if it wasn't for that lottery, we'd be right there ourselves. He started going there almost every day. It just reminded me of how much-- how much I love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where was it the two of you ended up going last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>Last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His butler said that the two of you had a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>No. Jay called to cancel at the last minute. He told me something had happened, something that we had to deal with together. And I tried to get him to tell me what it was, but he wouldn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where did he call from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>The Bowery soup kitchen. I--I think. That's where we were supposed to meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he have problems with anyone there that you know of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>No one in particular. It was a pretty rough crowd.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All my years as a mystery writer point to one unequivocal killer. The butler did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, come on! How many cases have we actually had where there's a-- a butler as a potential suspect? It would be a crime if he didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he shows up the next morning and calls the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pretty clever, right? Speaking of clever, I noticed at the crime scene, you never mentioned what you would do if you won the lottery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that because it's embarrassing? Ooh! Scandalous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I actually haven't really thought about it, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, not embarrassing or scandalous, just secretive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bad news travels fast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Winner's guilt. It's actually quite common with lottery recipients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did anything suspicious happen with Mr. Hixton when he was here last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone you didn't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, our mystery man goes to the soup kitchen, waits for Hixton, and then takes him...where? He wasn't killed for another six hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton, why not just take him home and empty his safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then there's Hixton's gun. Why did he need it, and where did he get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, according to CSU, nowhere legal. The serial numbers were filed off the gun, and Hixton's prints were on the bullets in the chamber, which means he loaded it himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Found our lottery winner's money bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where'd you find it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Alley behind Hixton's building. It was empty, but, as you can see, the dye pack in the bag went off. And it must've gotten on our killer's hands, because we got prints. Belonging to one Todd Shipley, a maintenance worker in Hixton's building. He got off right around the time Hixton was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but if he's a maintenance worker, he could've picked up the bag after the dye pack went off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Either that guy really likes Avatar--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or he's our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>TODD SHIPLEY</speaker><content>I swear, I found the bag on the ground and when I opened it, it went off in my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That bag was on a three minute timer. Are you telling us that you accidentally picked it up at exactly the wrong time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>TODD SHIPLEY</speaker><content>Man, I'm telling the truth! I--I'd just gotten off work, stopped to get a soda, when I saw someone running out of the alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This, uh, someone that ran away, what'd they look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>TODD SHIPLEY</speaker><content>I-- I don't know. It was dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So is your future, Todd, if you don't start telling us the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>TODD SHIPLEY</speaker><content>Man, I am! Yo, ask Mr. Lee at the Korean grocery. He--he-- he's the one who sold me the soda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Timer was set for three minutes. There's no way he could've gotten downstairs from the 20th floor and bought a drink before the dye pack exploded. All right, tell me this. Did you see Hixton in the building at all during your shift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>TODD SHIPLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, I was in the lobby when he came home around eleven. Uh, he was sweating like he'd been walking, and since he left early in his Escalade, I asked him where his car was. He said someone had taken it from him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, Mr. Lee confirmed Shipley's alibi, and Hixton's car is definitely missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it can't be a coincidence that on the same day Hixton's car was taken he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The killer could've gotten Hixton's home key when he took his ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Address was on the registration. He liked the car so much, he drove over to rob the apartment, got caught in the act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but why would Hixton go home? Why wouldn't he call the police, report the theft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.  Tracking company's got a lock on Hixton's Escalade. Looks like it's heading west on Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's the Holland Tunnel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our killer's making a run for it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Name's Shawn York. Jersey police caught him driving Hixton's car down the turnpike. No sign of the stolen money, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No disrespect to our Jersey brethren, but let's check that car again. Make sure that that money's not hidden behind a door panel or inside the wheel well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Ryan, what would you do if you won the lottery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Winery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See? Everyone thinks about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Everyone thinks about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What they would do if they won the lottery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>A big-ass boat, 60 footer, monster spinnaker hanging off the bow, two deep sea rods hanging off the stern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, while you guys are fantasizing about the size of your rods, I'm gonna go and interrogate our suspect.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>Can I get a soda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm not your flight attendant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm a homicide detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>I'mma say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're a bit of a rambler, Shawn. Assault in El Paso, criminal trespass in Memphis, and now first degree murder in New York City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>Wait, time out. Who did I kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jay Hixton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>No. He was alive when I saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was at the soup kitchen where you jacked his car. But then you got greedy and you followed him to his apartment. He ends up dead, you end up a 100 grand richer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>I didn't kill the guy, and I sure as hell didn't steal his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then how did you end up driving his car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>He gave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He gave you a $70,000 car? Why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>I heard on the street Hixton believed in second chances, so I tracked him down. Told him I was down on my luck, and Hixton said he didn't have his checkbook, but did I want his car? I thought he was yanking my chain. Who does that? But, you know, he signed over the title and handed me the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He just signed over the title just like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>Yes, ma'am. Said he wasn't gonna need it any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night at midnight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>I went to the late movie near my apartment. They're having a Tony Jaa marathon. Can I have that soda now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Theater clerk confirms selling York the ticket, and Hixton's signature on the car title is authentic. Who gives away their car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone who can afford to buy a thousand new ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, at six o'clock Hixton gives York his car, and then at eight o'clock he calls his wife and cancels dinner. Told her that there's something they need to talk about, something that they both need to deal with together. Then he gets home at eleven o'clock and about an hour later he's killed. So, what was he doing in the meantime and with whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the guy did like to spend money. If he made any charges on his credit card last night, might get us close to where he was.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if he spent any money the night he was killed, it was cash. There were no charges on any of his 32 credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>32 credit cards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. One for every NFL team, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. He also bought a racehorse, minority stake in a lingerie football team, and a Bentley which is currently at the bottom of the Hudson River because he drove it off of a boat he was renting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, sounds like that money really turned Hixton into a different person for a little while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, money doesn't change who you are. It just magnifies your personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, it wasn't all bad. He also bought a house for the clerk that sold him the winning ticket, a mausoleum for his dead neighbor, and three acres on the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Get outta town. He's right down the crater from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why doesn't it surprise me that you have property on the moon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? Laugh it up. When the earth is a desiccated husk, you will be begging to come live with me in the Nectaris Basin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So, I searched the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Sorry, York is not our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That's okay. Jersey impound lot's nice this time of year. So, no money, as expected. But I did find this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A camera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Lodged under the front seat. Clearly it belongs to Hixton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These are surveillance photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, a dozen of them date stamped last week. Hixton was following this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, contact the family and butler, see if anyone recognizes him. Meanwhile, we've got a hole in our timeline that needs to be plugged. So, we know that Hixton called his wife at 8 p.m. and we know that he wasn't at the soup kitchen. Let's ping the carrier, see if they know where he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you quit your job? If you won the lottery, would you quit being a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what else would I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Supermodel. Brain surgeon. American Gladiator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, you got me there, Castle. I've always wanted to leave the force and become an American Gladiator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don't you want to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so there's nothing really to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on, you must have a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure I do. Solve this case, go home, take a nice long bath. But it doesn't look like that's going to happen tonight. Hixton's phone carrier. Hey, Esposito! That phone call to Hixton's wife came from the 500 block of Lexington. I don't think we can get a more exact address. We're gonna have to canvass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, maybe not. I just saw a Lexington Avenue in his financials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Right here. He wrote two checks last month. $10,000 each to a company called Meech Industries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meech? Logan Meech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, he's listed here as the owner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I must've arrested that guy like half a dozen times. He's a low-rent scam artist with a history of violence. Last time I busted him, he was trying to grill cheese a guy in a dry-cleaning press.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why would Hixton be writing checks to a character like that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Logan Meech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>Detective, I love what you've done with your--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>Hey. Who's the new guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? You want to send him Christmas cards from death row?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>What? Wait. I didn't kill anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, it's just a coincidence that you were with Jay Hixton shortly before he was shot to death in his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>What, Hixton's dead? Ugh. He was, uh, one of my investors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? What is it Mr. Hixton was investing in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>My relief organization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why is it I'm thinking the only relief Mr. Hixton's money provided was to your own bank account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Hixton get onto your scamming him? Did he threaten to go to the cops? Is that why you killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>I told you I didn't kill him. I--I hadn't seen him in weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's funny, because I talked to your landlord and he said that he remembers clearly seeing Hixton at your place last night. So, either you start telling us the truth and playing ball, or I call the D.A. and get them to draw up murder charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>Okay, look, hang on a minute now. Um, maybe I, uh, I misspoke, okay? Um, Hixton did actually pay me a visit last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>He wanted a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>Uh, protection. He was scared. He paid me a grand for a-- a .357 that I was holding for a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what was he scared of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>MEECH</speaker><content>His past. He said it was coming back to get him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that mean? His past was coming back to get him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why go to Meech for a gun? Why not just go to the police or hire a bodyguard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe he didn't think they could protect him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>CSU finished processing Hixton's apartment, came across two sets of finger prints that were in the system. Couple of career criminals from Hixton's hometown in Florida.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greg and Ty Page. Previous busts for bank robbery and currently serving a nickel for grand larceny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that info's a little bit behind. They were released last week due to overcrowding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, get to the part about who they robbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A month after he collected his jackpot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Even though they wore ski masks, he recognized them by their voices because they grew up together. It was his testimony that put them away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hixton must've heard they were being released and worried they were coming after him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to Florida police, the brothers were in town for all of two days before they packed up their car and headed up north. Told a neighbor that they were going hunting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like they bagged themselves a lottery winner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa! Looks like you made a serious dent in your surprise inheritance. Is it safe to say there is not an animal print left in any store in New York City?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Very funny. Probably true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, congratulations. Looks like you have successfully completed the first stage in the five stages of hitting the jackpot: shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What's the next stage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if you are my lottery winning victim, you turn to charity and then get shot to death in your living room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I'll pass. Besides, I've decided to give back the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, I was about to break up with the man. Do you really think he would've left me that money if he'd known that? No. No, I'm going to return all this stuff, I'm going to give back the money. It's the right thing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you've just jumped to stage five. Enlightenment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah. Then again, Chet did adore me. So, I think I should be able to keep one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It's not real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Detective Beckett. Did you call to tell me a bedtime story?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which car is theirs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The maroon one over there, Florida plates. It's registered to a Greg Page. We put an alert on their plate number, which got triggered when a traffic cop ticketed them about an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea where they are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>None. So, we watch the car until someone shows up.  Any sign yet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's a negative.  A winery, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jenny and I visited one on our first vacation together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A hundred mil and you're gonna become a farmer? Your fiancée really has done some damage on you, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Like Lanie hasn't changed you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Come on, dude, we-- we all know about the two of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What--? Castle and Beckett know, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said earlier that money doesn't change us, it just magnifies who we are. What did your windfall magnify in you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My inner child. At first. Kind of like Hixton. The one who likes, you know, private jets, five star everything. But then I realized the only luxury I truly care about is freedom. The freedom to write, spend time with Alexis. Having that money just...allows me to live life on my terms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You grew up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn't go that far. That property on the moon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just bought that last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who's this guy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yo. Dreadlocks, twelve o'clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD, let me see your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The Page brothers, where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>DREADLOCKS</speaker><content>Upstairs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>12 gauge shotgun. Get on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Jump on the counter, let off a round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>You wet yourself as you hit the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Take command with my outside voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>We're robbing this *****. We ain't got no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Don't hit the alarm. Don't beg for your mama.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>Seal up that bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shut it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>Move--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>What the hell, yo? That was slamming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Three armed cops and a writer makes four. You're under arrest. So, get on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Got about 60 grand here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where's the other 40 you took from Hixton's safe when you killed him? You spend it on your rap career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Nah, you've got it all wrong, Shorty. We didn't kill the man. We came up here to help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>Got out the joint for good behavior. Dude called us up, said he needed a savior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stop rapping. I'll buy the album. Savior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Yeah. His daughter got back into drugs. He needed to make things right, so he called us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The two of you robbed Hixton at gunpoint in Florida. Why would he call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>When Hixton realized what kind of trouble Nicole was in, he knew we were the only people he could turn to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what could you possibly do to help his daughter with her addiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Problem wasn't the drugs. It was her dealer. Her cat named Oz. Nicole was under his spell something fierce. When Hixton found out about it, he went to go see Oz, told the man, "Stay away from my daughter." When Oz didn't, he called us. You don't believe me, look in my wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like Nicole lied to me when she told me she didn't recognize him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's the guy Hixton had under surveillance. Is this Oz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Yep. When Hixton called us, we drove right up here, jumped Oz outside this club downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Yo, Ty hit his bodyguard with a pipe, I stuffed Oz in the trunk, drove under the bridge and beat on his ass. Then we came straight here. Been bouncing tunes ever since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that true? Did they come here last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>GREG PAGE</speaker><content>Yeah, we told the man to "stay away from Nicole, or we're gonna put your ass in the river." He told us we should do it, 'cause if we let him live, he was gonna burn us alive. You want to know who killed Hixton, gotta be Oz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Hixton gets a gun to protect himself from Oz. He can't get the cops, 'cause that'll get his daughter in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>TY PAGE</speaker><content>What the hell was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, watch them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stay right where you are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like Oz wasn't kidding when he said he'd burn them alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it true, Nicole? Did you start using again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>After I got clean, Oz found me. He said he wanted me back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>Nicole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>And your father knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>He blamed himself. He said that he was gonna fix it all, but I never thought...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This Oz, you think he's capable of killing your dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>NICOLE HIXTON</speaker><content>This is all my fault. Dad is dead because of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>NOREEN HIXTON</speaker><content>It's okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oz, AKA Marvin Osminkowski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No wonder he changed his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to Vice, he has a lucrative gig peddling high end product to the city's rich and famous, and a car bomb is definitely his M.O. Competing dealer got blown up last year, but didn't have enough evidence to convict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Oz shoots Hixton for ordering the beat down, and then attempts to barbeque the Page brothers to complete his revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let's go pick up Oz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that's gonna be difficult. According to Vice, Oz pretty much operates off grid. The only time he's on is when he's dealing out of word of mouth night clubs. And, even there, he's got a network of bouncers, waiters, and patrons as lookouts. If Oz catches one whiff of bacon, he vanishes into thin air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's gotta be some way to slip under the radar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think we're gonna need your Ferrari.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, my. Look at you. Oh, you look gorgeous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm just gonna grab my keys and change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You two going out on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, no. We're just doing a little undercover work. So, how are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ahhh eh. I've been better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle told me that you decided to give the money back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I tried. Chet's kids refused to take it. They said their father loved me, wanted me to have the money. So, I'm...you know, trying to figure out what to do with it. Everything I come up with seems so selfish and petty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it doesn't have to be that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, someone once told me that money doesn't change you, it just magnifies who you are. You cared about Chet. Maybe you could do something that would honor his memory somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That is a lovely thought. Thank you. Really, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Got the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, great. I'm driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're driving? Beckett, this is-- this is a Ferrari. It is a high-performance vehicle designed to respond instantaneously to your every whim, your every movement, every--</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. Nice car.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Drinks. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, come on, please. You gotta let me go in there and see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, that's because I just came into town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ibiza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, a little birdie told me all about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Said that you know how to keep a party going all night long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of course. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um. I like to feel shiny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's okay. Good things always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! Handcuffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then let's take an even bigger step down. Into a prison jumpsuit. I got you dead to rights on possession with the intent to sell. That's 20 years federal time. But that's nothing compared to time that you're gonna do for first degree murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not to mention felony blowing crap up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You remember this guy? You should. You killed him. And these two you tried to kill with a car bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here's the thing, Marvin, we showed your picture around Hixton's place. Oddly enough, people saw you there right about the time he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Page brothers gave you a serious beating. You vowed revenge, and then Hixton shows up dead with witnesses claiming to see you at the crime scene? That doesn't look good for you, Marvin, and lying to us will only make it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were hot to straighten Hixton out and you changed your mind. Do you really expect us to believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You get a good look at this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The butler really did do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easley, the butler. Loyal, devoted, seemingly distraught over the death of his master. Yet all the while, lurking behind that mask of servile correctness, was a killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or Oz is just trying to kick up some dust. I mean, what's the butler's motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, in fiction it would be one of two things. Firstly, he was carrying on a torrid affair with his master's wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Second, had to be the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think Castle might be on to something. I dug a little deeper into Reginald Easley, and his last few employers all say the same thing. Easley resigned after some of their valuables went missing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I realize I've been thinking about this all wrong. You're not a frivolous person, so you wouldn't do frivolous things with your lottery winnings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. I'm gonna figure this out. If you e--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Packing your things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>These aren't my things. They belong to my employer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Must be hard being around all this wealth and none of it yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>I'm content with my lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? We read up on you. Born in Leeds to a single mother who was a seamstress. With the right training, you lost the lowbrow accent and learned to fit in with the gentry, where you saw people spend more in one day than your mother made in an entire year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then along comes Hixton, a man with an upbringing not unlike your own. But he owned all this. And he owned you. Not because of any special talent or intelligence, just because he guessed six numbers. And you didn't. And taking from Hixton wasn't really stealing, it was just correcting a karmic injustice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You made him open that safe, but what you didn't know was that he had a gun. And when he reached for it, this is where it ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>What on earth makes you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know that you were here the night that he was killed, Mr. Easely. Long after you said that you had left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Early on, he bought 25 first edition Dickens. Charles Dickens. The man didn't even read. He just liked the look of the leather on their spines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Easley--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>I stole two of them. To me it was like levying a tax on him for being an idiot, but then I had a change of heart. I brought them back here that night around eleven o'clock, thinking he was out with his wife. But, for some reason, he was here. I-- I heard the shower running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your excuse for coming back here the night that he was killed was that you had a change of heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Yes. I'd like to say it was because his turn to philanthropy made me see him in a different light, as a good man one shouldn't steal from. But the truth is, I was scared his bad luck would become mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He won over a hundred million in the lottery. One could hardly consider that bad luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>Mmm. His marriage failed, his daughter fell into drugs, and he was just gunned down in his own apartment. That, sir, is the universe - what did you call it? - Yes, correcting a karmic injustice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>The winning lottery ticket. Hixton let it slip one night after a little too much time with the bottle. He always played the same numbers. The dates he and his wife met and were married. 1-3-95 and 10-24-98.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>None of those numbers are on the ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>EASLEY</speaker><content>All the misery that came from the money? Hixton believed it was because he stole the ticket.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So, you think Hixton was murdered because he stole the ticket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on. I mean, it was worth a fortune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Easley had every reason to make up that story. And even if those weren't Hixton's regular numbers, it still doesn't prove that he stole the ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But the theft explains so much about Hixton's behavior. The director of the soup kitchen said that Hixton compulsively gave away his money like he felt he didn't deserve it. I called it "winner's guilt." But what if it was another kind of guilt entirely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Let's say that you're right. Let's say that Hixton stole the ticket. There's still no evidence suggesting that that contributed to his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're the first person to tell me that there are no coincidences in a murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Hold on, Detective. He's got a point. You said Hixton told Meech his past was coming back to get him. Now, we thought he meant the Page brothers, but this ticket represents the biggest thing that ever happened to him. I call that a major motive for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Then, if it's true, how do we prove it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The numbers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>2, 4, 8, 19, 41, and 79. I know it's a long shot, but if we can figure out what these numbers signify, we might be able to find the ticket's real owner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I play my kids' birthdays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I play my firsts. Sex and combat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I play his firsts, too. What? That way we both win and it's not awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sorry. I don't play, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But, if you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, doesn't really matter, Castle. I mean, the fact is, Hixton won the lottery a year ago. If he stole that ticket, why didn't the rightful owner come forward sooner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Maybe the rightful owner is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Hixton killed him. The moon. The weird purchases Hixton made as soon as he won. He bought three acres on the moon and a mausoleum for his neighbor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find out everything we can on this neighbor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'm on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you're right, Castle, I'm betting Hixton's neighbor never imagined that the luckiest day of his life would also be his last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Booyah! Neighbor's name was Hank Walters. He died the day the winning numbers were announced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Walters' birthday: 2/8/41. Three of the numbers in the lottery ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two days later, Hixton came forward to claim his 117 million dollar check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did Walters die of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Natural causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. He was an old man dying of, like, six different things. Lanie went over the autopsy, said everything looked like it was on the up and up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Walters is bedridden. Hixton, like any good neighbor, asks the old man if there's anything he can do for him. Walters says, "Yes. Buy me a lottery ticket." Maybe it was a one time thing, maybe he did it all the time. This time, numbers are announced and Walters won. Hixton rushes back to tell him and finds Walters dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And doesn't know what to do. That's why it took him an extra day to come forward. He was struggling with the moral implications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. But desperate times call for desperate measures. He claimed the ticket as his own. Clearly no one else knew about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about family? Did Walters have any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, according to the county records, he only living relative of Hank Walters is a nephew named Tom. And guess where he lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>New York City.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>TOM WALTERS</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Are you telling me that I might inherit a hundred million dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on, Tom. You already figured that out. You confronted Hixton. You told him you wanted restitution. He said no, things got ugly, and Hixton ended up dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you grabbed what was in the safe, and you took off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>TOM WALTERS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Knock it off, Tom. You're the old man's only living relative. You're the only one with motive for revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>TOM WALTERS</speaker><content>No. I'm not his only relative. He's got a son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he doesn't. We checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>TOM WALTERS</speaker><content>Well, sure, he's not biological. Hank dated his mom for, like, five years while the kid was growing up. The two bonded like crazy. Kept in touch even after the romance broke up. They even spend every holiday together for the last ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This son, is his birthday 4/19/79?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>TOM WALTERS</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because those are the three remaining numbers on the winning lottery ticket.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You lied to us about who you are, Shawn. These are your Dad's numbers. Your birthday and his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>I don't know what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When did you realize that Hixton had stolen the winning ticket? Was it when you were still in prison in Memphis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or was it after you got out, went to go and visit your Dad, found out he was dead? And that his mausoleum was paid for with the stolen winnings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can't imagine how you must have felt. How driven you were to come to New York, make things right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You tracked down Hixton at the soup kitchen, threatened him with all kinds of things if he didn't do right by you. He freaked out. He gave you his car. But that wasn't enough, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>You can't prove any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can prove all of it, Shawn. We found the money from Hixton's safe in your apartment with trace amounts of his blood on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what happened next? I mean, why would you walk away with only a hundred grand? He owed you millions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>SHAWN YORK</speaker><content>Hm. I went to his apartment to collect what was mine. He told me I didn't deserve the money. Said that I was a dirt bag criminal and all I was gonna do, if he gave it to me, was put it up my nose. Instead, he was gonna give it all away to those in need. I told him I was in need. Then he grabbed for my gun. It went off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what's gonna happen with all that money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that's for the lawyers to decide. The good thing is that Nicole is going back into rehab and her mom's gonna be there for her when she gets out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, at least something good will come of all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is it for me. I am beat. I'll see you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, you giving up? No more questions about my innermost jackpot dreams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said you didn't have any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Goodnight, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Goodnight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good evening, ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you buying property?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram decided what to do with her inheritance. I think it's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I'm going to open the Martha Rodgers School of Acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. I-- I thought you were gonna do something to honor Chet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I am. Oh, no, Chet was always encouraging me to use my enormous talent to help people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then wouldn't you call it the Chet Paliburn School of Acting, given the auspices?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, well-- It's customary when you're opening the school, you use a great teacher's name. Like, um, Strasberg, Meisner, Adler, and now Rodgers. Oh, I am, however, going to commission a portrait to be done of Chet that will hang in the lobby so his legacy will last forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Legacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know what Beckett would do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know what you would do if you won the lottery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By all means, please come in. So, what is your big insight into a financial decision that I will never have to make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You would use the money to honor your mother's legacy. On the way over here, I called the dean of your mom's old law school. We talked about starting a scholarship in Johanna Beckett's name. One that would provide a full ride for a student planning on dedicating their career to those in the legal system without a voice, the kind of people your mom championed. And, with your blessing, I would like to host a fundraiser to fund it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You just can't stay out of my personal life, can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. It's really sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We definitely have to invite the mayor, and all of his campaign contributors. Some of them can be boorish. They got this one guy...</content></utterance>
