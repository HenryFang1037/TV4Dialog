<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Set up your profile. Name? Martha Rodgers. Sex? Female. Race?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Color-blind. Why should I categorize myself? Shades of gray, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Age?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ageless. No, better yet, timeless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you don't want to put that. Makes you sound like you belong in a museum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, you have a point. Uh, I know, type in "old enough."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you ladies doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Alexis is assisting me in creating a MyFace account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Save your breath. I've been correcting her all morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, it's my face, isn't it? It's not your face or someone else's face. I don't... Well, anyway. My fellow cast members have been raving about what fun it is, what a great networking tool it is, so here I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And now you just need to select a photo for your profile page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay. Should we go dramatic? Or commercial? Or sassy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don't you have anything from this century?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Why? You think the hair is a bit dated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not exactly what I was getting at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh-huh. I know what you were getting at. You're no spring chicken yourself, you know. Have you looked in the mirror lately? I have two words for you, "hairline" and "receding."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ha! Made you look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She totally got you, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, Beckett. Either there's a dead body or you just want to hear my sultry voice. -- Dead body it is. Where?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got here fast, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My side of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, what do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Be my guest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. Our victim's name is Caleb Shimky...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shimansky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, it's a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he was pulling a Kevin Bacon in Quicksilver when all of...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm sorry, a what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Quicksilver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kevin Bacon is a bike messenger who failed as a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito, take him to school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The victim is Caleb Shimansky, an on-duty bike messenger. A masked suspect in a black four-door plows into him, killing him instantly. Then the suspect steals the messenger bag, jumps in his ride and jets off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See, that wasn't so hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, it's good, if you like the dull, non-best-seller version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I thought I gave it some flair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm assuming we have plenty of witnesses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Several. Three of them got the suspect's license plate number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aw, man. It's like having a cheat code. You've got multiple witnesses and a license plate number. It's gonna take you all of, what, five minutes to solve it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ran the suspect's plates, the car was reported stolen an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A masked man in a stolen car. Our thief planned this and obviously wanted what was ever in that messenger bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Something our vic was delivering. A package or a box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Contact the courier company. I want to know what was in that bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever it was, it was important enough to kill the messenger.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, we got an APB out on the car, but Esposito and Ryan got nothing on the canvass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Do we know what was in the package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The, uh, courier company's looking into it right now. Whatever it was, somebody thought that it was worth killing for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Off the top of my head, I'm gonna go with nuclear launch codes, Dick Cheney's soul on its way to the devil...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>All good theories, Castle. All good theories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, sir, are you okay? You seem a little distracted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>No, I'm focused. Focused on the precinct being up for review and our case closure rate being just under 1PP's new mandated minimum. Which, of course, doesn't take the budget cuts into consideration. Now, how the hell am I supposed to catch more bad guys with fewer detectives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Cap. Courier company said the vic only had one package in his bag. Picked up from 2739 West 2nd, Apartment 3-C. Sent by one S. Nidal Mattar. I ran it through the system. There's a Shakir Nidal Mattar on the terror watch list. Could be the same guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Where was the package going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>614 East 72nd Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>East 72nd. That's the 64th Precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, that could be an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I need a full tactical alert. Have them evacuate the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'll coordinate with Homeland Security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is Detective Beckett. We have a possible terrorist attack against the 64th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah, this is Captain Roy Montgomery. I need to speak to your task force leader...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hell yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>...I need to speak to your command center right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Get ESU over to the pick-up address immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All units on alert. All units on alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah, this is Montgomery of the 12th Precinct...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where's Nidal Mattar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>But...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shakir Nidal Mattar, where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>There's no Shakir Nidal Nattar here! Only Sally Niedermeyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ma'am, did you send a package by bike courier this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Yes, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>S. Nidal Mattar, S. Niedermeyer. Some bozo at the courier company wrote the name wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Our bad. I'm gonna... We can...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, we can fix this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Grab that. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Niedermeyer, somebody stole the courier bag that your package was in. And in the course of the crime, a bike messenger was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Oh, that's terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we're trying to figure out why they stole the bag. You sent it to the 64th Precinct, is that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could you tell us what was in the package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"No," you don't want to? Or "no," you don't remember or know what's in the package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Yes. To the second part. The-- the don't know part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where'd you get the package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>From my favorite nephew. Brady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, where can we find Brady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>In prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Prison" prison? When did he give you the package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Ten years ago, just before they sent him upstate. Brady came over, handed me the package, and then he said, "Mema, take good care of this package. Don't tell anyone about it. And never, ever open it."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why all of a sudden would you messenger it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Brady called about 7:30 this morning and asked me to send it right away to the man it was addressed to. The man who arrested him 10 years ago, Detective Roy Montgomery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's Captain Roy Montgomery now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Oh! You know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he's our boss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The package was coming to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What's his name again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brady Thompson. It was back when you were a detective with the 6-4.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, it's ringing some bells. But why would he send me a 10-year-old package?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito's on the phone with Corrections. He's trying to get an interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you recall anything at all about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He killed a lady. A push-in robbery gone bad. Open and shut case. I think we even got a confession out of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The aunt said that he was pretty insistent about getting the package directly to you. Do you know why that would be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You would have to ask him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not unless you perform a séance. He's dead. Got shanked in prison this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This morning? That's no coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Have Records pull everything from the old case. If memory serves, Brady was married when he went away. See if the wife is still the wife and if she knows anything. Beckett, call the warden. I want to see what they know about Brady's murder. And-- and I need copies of all his phone calls. I want to know exactly what he said to Aunt Sally and anyone else, for that matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. Paisley Shimansky's here to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's the bike messenger's sister. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How does she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Better than anyone I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Her brother died trying to get something to me. No, I'm not okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The prison sent over the last two phone calls Brady made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Can't I just put it in the mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>No, Aunt Sally, you've got to take it down there yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>My hip's been acting up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>Then call a messenger service. I'll pay you back, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>All right, I'll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>I've got to go now, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>SALLY NIEDERMEYER</speaker><content>Take care now, Brady. Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>I love you too, Mema. I-- I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nothing about what was in the package.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At 7:23 he makes this phone call to his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Yes, I'll accept the charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>Val?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Hey, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>Val, listen to me. Remember what we talked about last time you visited?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>It's going down today. You and Jared get out of the house now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Brady...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BRADY THOMPSON</speaker><content>There's no time to talk. Just go. Everything's gonna be all right. Give Jared a kiss from Dad, okay? I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>I love you, too. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brady was killed 45 minutes after those two phone calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah, but we don't have a why or a who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or a how it's related to your mystery package.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Warden have any suspects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A whole prison yard full. He was shanked in the yard. There were no witnesses. Warden's less than optimistic about catching the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Brady have any beefs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Apparently, he was the model prisoner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Then it must've been a hit ordered from the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By the same guys who killed our messenger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Any luck on tracking down Brady's wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Big fat zippo. But they left the apartment in a hurry. I pinged the cell phones, tracked the credit cards. She's off the grid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe not completely. I just got off the phone with the son's school. According to the principal, Brady's kid misses class every Tuesday because he's got some kind of respiratory condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Tomorrow's Tuesday. You get the doctor's name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Let's set up on the office in the morning. We might get lucky.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What you doing, Mother? Working on your play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, I wish. I've been bombarded with friend requests. It's like a part-time job. And these exchanges are just ridiculous. Dot Ellison, who I have absolutely no desire to reconnect with, has just wasted 20 minutes of my life recounting the bravery of her cat passing a kidney stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it could have been worse. She could have sent you a video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Joining up with this fad was a terrible mistake. Nothing good comes from the internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you just got another friend request.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>OMG! Chet Palaburn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who's Chet Palaburn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Star athlete, class president, homecoming king. My high school sweetheart. And my first!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I really didn't need to know that last part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, oh, he sent a message with his request. "I'm living in New York now and would love to see you. Martha, you haven't changed a bit." Oh, Chet Palaburn! Can you believe it? And did you see that message?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do know that Chet's comments are based on a 20-year-old photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. Well, should I accept his friend request? I mean, the last time I laid eyes on him, I was 18. And, and now he sees this photo. And now this, and... What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's your call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>My call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's always Dot and her kitty cat's medical mysteries.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Another dead end in the messenger case. Uniforms located the stolen car that ran him down, but CSU got bupkis. No prints, no hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's sounding more and more like a professional hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about surveillance? Any cameras around where the car was dumped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, our masked man knew what he was doing. Well, at least our tip on the doctor paid off. Prison vic's wife came in with her son first thing this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain and Beckett are interviewing her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I wouldn't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're working on it. Ms. Thompson, do you know anything about a package that your husband asked his Aunt Sally to send out for him yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Yeah. It was his insurance policy. He gave it to her when he went away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Insurance policy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>It was proof he didn't kill the woman he went to jail for murdering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>But he confessed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Well, he might have confessed, but he didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>With all due respect, Mrs. Thompson, half the men in prison will swear up and down they didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>Do those men's wives get a package in the mail every month with $7,000 cash in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, your husband confessed to a murder he didn't commit for money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>I know this will sound crazy, but we didn't know what else to do. Jared was born with a rare respiratory disease, and we didn't have the money or the insurance to get him the therapy he needed. If Brady hadn't done what he did, Jared wouldn't even be alive right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Did Brady ever tell you who actually committed the murder he went away for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>No. I-- I don't even know if he knew who it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Over ten years, you never asked who his contact was, who approached him, who was paying you? You just conveniently never bothered to ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>VALERIE THOMPSON</speaker><content>I asked! But-- but Brady felt that the less I knew, the safer I would be. E-- even the packages didn't have a return address. Look, Captain, my husband was just killed. I'm telling you all I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so what we know so far is that about four months ago the payments to Brady started arriving late, short and then, finally, not at all. And according to the wife, that's when Brady decided to messenger over his insurance policy. That was supposed to prove his innocence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our patsy, Brady, had to be in communication with whoever was making payments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Prison should have a record of everyone Brady talked to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We already checked his phone logs. There's nothing there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How about e-mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We're running it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, whatever Brady said, it worked. Payments started up again. Then, a month ago, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think maybe Brady got fed up with the situation? Figured if whoever he made the deal with wasn't holding up their end of the bargain, why was he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then he calls up his Aunt Sally, asks her to send the evidence that proves his innocence to the arresting officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it possible someone was monitoring his calls? I mean, whoever killed our bike messenger had to have been tipped off the package was in motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The only people that monitor calls are prison staff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>$7,000 a month for ten years is almost a million, total. Whoever we're dealing with obviously has the means to buy somebody off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Get the duty roster from the prison. See who was working when Brady made his calls. Set up a protection detail for the wife and the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's already done, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain, you had the confessions, the evidence. Anyone would have come to the same conclusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I didn't push hard enough. I knew this case was off. Everything just fell into place so perfectly. Now what have we got? An innocent bystander with no connection to the killer. And without physical evidence, there's no way of tracking who was driving that car. And catching a break on a prison murder? That's a long shot. Especially if you're dealing with a corrupt guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, but we still have the original murder from ten years ago. Everything started there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Two fresh bodies, and you want to look at a murder ten years cold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh... When I'm writing a story, the beginning is always the hardest. But if you nail that, the rest of it can just fall into place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Castle, this is not one of your books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but it is a mystery. And all mysteries are the same. Motive, opportunity, cover-up, conscience. These murders today were to cover up one ten years ago. That's where your leads are gonna be. Come on, Captain, what do you say? Let's take a little trip down memory lane.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Olivia Debiasse, 20 years old. Neighbors found her bludgeoned to death in her apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. There were some things missing from her apartment. Whoever killed her tried to make it look like a robbery gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>There should be something in there about a handyman that we looked at for it. You know, he had a criminal record, he worked in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If it was him, I'm in the wrong line of work. $7,000 a month for a handyman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We moved off him once we moved on Brady. An anonymous tip came in. It felt like a break at the time. Brought him in, leaned on him for, what, maybe a half hour before he broke. You know, it's funny. I-- I never actually even looked at some of these reports, because once the canvassing detectives turned them in, we already had Brady in custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it says here that Olivia went to a party earlier the night she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Says here the Pierson Club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pierson Club? That's high society, that's crème de la crème. My money goes in banks, their money buys banks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, listen to this. A waitress gave a statement saying that she saw Olivia having a heated argument with a man at the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The plot thickens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm. There's no name, but according to the description she gave, he was in his mid-20s, medium build, wearing a blue blazer and an orange-striped tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, I don't know about you guys, but I am getting a delicious millionaire playboy vibe here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The waitress was under the impression that he arrived with Olivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Olivia's best friend was a gal that she worked with. Maybe she could tell us who Olivia hung out with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Perlmutter just finished reviewing Olivia's autopsy report from back in the day. He says he found something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You guys take the morgue. I'll follow up on Olivia's friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I've gone through Ms. Debiasse's files and her autopsy was fairly limited. I assume when Brady confessed, the M.E. decided not to be thorough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he miss something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It's hard to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does your gut tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>My gut tells me I'm hungry, but I'm not gonna be able to eat until I'm done with the two of you. So why don't I just tell you what my keen M.E. training tells me? All right, Brady said he hit Olivia with a baseball bat. But look at these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>When I look at these wounds and then skull fracture pattern, I'm just not seeing a baseball bat strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brady lied about killing her, he might have lied about what was used to do it. Can you determine how she was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I'd only be speculating. To do it properly, I'd have to X-ray the skull and examine the remains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want to exhume the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>The only way to do it right. Plus, who knows what else I might find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Olivia was raised by a single mom who's deceased as well, so let me call the next of kin and see what I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure it's sanitary to be eating here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>You know the strength of the disinfectants we use here? This is the cleanest room in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I couldn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Homemade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I couldn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Caught a break. Captain talked to the friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does she remember who Olivia was with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeff Dilahunt, who's had his fair share of run-ins with the law. And he has a trust fund worth millions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Enough to pay $7,000 a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bingo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Boo-yah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Uh, I met Olivia at a nightclub. She hadn't been in town long, but, uh, she seemed like a real party girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were the two of you dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Uh, no, just friends. What? Can't a guy and a girl just be friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Are you two together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Look, it was, uh, no big deal. I happened to mention that a school friend of mine was having a family reunion here at the Pierson Club and asked me to stop by. Olivia really wanted to come, so I took her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who would want to go to someone else's family reunion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Well, I suppose that all depends on the family. In this case, it happened to be the Wellesleys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The W-- "Wellesleys" Wellesleys? The rich and powerful Wellesleys? The conservative New York Wellesleys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wasn't that one of our senators?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he was. Senator Casper Wellesley. He died early '90s. His kid's running for his seat again this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Well, I'll tell you what. Next time I'm invited, I'll take you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Dilahunt, where were you between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. the night that she was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Okay, well, a couple of, uh, Wellesley cousins and I bailed early and went clubbing. I believe there may have been Bolivian Marching Powder involved. We got picked up for public intoxication. My father got the charges dropped, but, uh, there's still a record of our arrest. If you can't find it, I have a framed copy at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you have an argument with Olivia that night? Or see anyone else who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A witness saw Olivia having it out with a man in a blue blazer and an orange-striped tie. Do you remember anyone who fit that description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>Actually, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>JEFF DILAHUNT</speaker><content>All Wellesley family events have a strict dress code. The, uh, blazers are standard, but Lenanne Wellesley, the family matriarch, handpicks the men's ties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep. We got a hell of a lot of suspects.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yes, Chief. No, I know, Chief. As soon as I possibly can, Chief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>They cut our staff 20%, they get upset when our closure rate drops 3%. You ask me, we're working miracles to do what we're doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sir, we can do this later if you have a higher priority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Never let the job get in the way of the job. Where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Brady and his contact communicated through a dummy e-mail account. We tried to trace the address, but it was a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Where are we with reviewing the guards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nowhere. The warden refuses to provide us with a duty roster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Said he was offended we assumed one of his men was dirty. He wanted to handle it in-house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah? Well, that doesn't work for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do any of these men look like the one that you saw arguing with Olivia the night of the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>EDWINA</speaker><content>Look, it was a stupid waitress job ten years ago. Do you remember what you were doing ten years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you recall any details? Was he wearing glasses? Did he have a tattoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>EDWINA</speaker><content>All I know is that the man was yelling at the girl. He got so riled up he spilled his wine, and I ended up cleaning it off the carpet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he spill any on himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>EDWINA</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trent Wellesley? I'm Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I need to have a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Yes. My old friend Jeff said I might be hearing from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Police? Are they the police?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Yes, Grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>My ring was stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Oh, oh. Th-- they're not here for you, Grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>My ring was stolen. It's expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>FRANK DAVIS</speaker><content>Trent, perhaps you should take this conversation elsewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Of course, Frank. She gets a little confused sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Okay, let's get this over with. It was me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was you? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I was the one who had the argument with the girl that Jeff brought to the reunion that night. The girl who was killed. I didn't care for her behavior, so I asked her to leave. Girls like that hang around families like mine for a reason. They want something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeff brought her as his plus-one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>But he had left by then and she stayed. She tried to chat up more than one of my relatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anyone in particular?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You're barking up the wrong tree. No one in my family had anything to do with what happened to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone paid almost a million dollars to cover up her murder. That makes everyone in your family a suspect, including you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Trust me, if I had that kind of money to throw around, I wouldn't be here sucking up to the old lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You think I'm rich because my last name's Wellesley, but my dad died when I was a kid. Mom and me had to pretty much survive off the handouts of relatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I suppose getting a job would be out of the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you protecting? You already admitted to arguing with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It really does not look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You have to understand. He's like the only father I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you talking about, Trent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>My Uncle Winston. He'd just been through a bad breakup and... He's the kind of person that people try to take advantage of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People like who? Olivia? Or poor relations looking for a handout?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>TRENT WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I'd seen her with him before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Yes, it's terrible what happened to that poor girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could you tell us about the kind of relationship you had with her, Mr. Wellesley? Was the reunion the first time that you two met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Actually, I believe I met Olivia at a cocktail party a few weeks before that. Was it MoMA? I don't recall. Anyway, I took a shine to her. Charming. Ambitious. Rough around the edges, but I felt I could mentor her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And by mentor, you mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>What are you suggesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your nephew Trent said that he saw her hitting on you the whole night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Well, that's Trent for you. He's always been very protective of the family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the night she was murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Are you seriously asking me, Winston Wellesley, for an alibi? Oh. Apparently, you are. Fine. I was home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can anyone corroborate that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Yes. God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Mr. Wellesley, your car is ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Mmm. As delightful as this conversation has been, I must take my leave. I have to meet my brother at his campaign headquarters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, yes. Blake Wellesley, running for Senate again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. And we'd appreciate your support. Don't forget to vote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have no doubt he was having an affair with Olivia. But why would he kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you think maybe he was upset that she came with someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. Jealousy. Money. Murder. Does it get any better than this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>You want to exhume my niece's body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe that there was evidence overlooked during the autopsy that could lead to her killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>Well, you told me you caught the man. You told me it was over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I thought it was. But whoever killed Olivia just murdered two more people. Your niece deserves justice, and so do they.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>She was such a special girl. She quit school to take care of her mother when the cancer got bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That says a lot about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>After her mother passed, it was like she had to get away. When she moved to the city I was just so happy for her. But then... You'll bury her back the way she was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>At least she had the funeral she deserved. Thank God for Mr. Wellesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Wellesley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>The man who paid for everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which Mr. Wellesley was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>SARA</speaker><content>Winston Wellesley.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Paid for her funeral? Can anyone say "guilty conscience"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, Esposito, run down Winston Wellesley's alibi. Talk to doormen, chauffeurs, the whole gamut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'll see what I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Prison duty roster. How'd you pull it off, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>They didn't make me captain just because I look good behind a desk. Run all the guards on that roster. Look for anything out of the ordinary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I'm gonna call the cemetery to make arrangements to exhume the body tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You know what I don't get? Whoever is behind this, why'd he stop paying Brady? These Wellesleys have plenty of money. If the money hadn't stopped, Brady never would have set off this triggering domino that started all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me let you in on a little secret. You know how rich people stay rich? They are cheap. Why pay for Brady for the rest of his life, when you can kill him for a fraction of the price?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But then why would he wait ten years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Something changed. Something must have happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Captain Montgomery? Blake Wellesley. Hate to bother you, but do you have a minute to chat?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I speak for the entire Wellesley family when I say you can expect our full cooperation in this investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But? You can tell, there's a "but" coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Not a "but," a "however." Like I said, we'll cooperate; however, we request that these unannounced interviews come to a stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, let's hear him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I apologize if I'm coming off like one of those guys, Detective. It's just that these impromptu visits are a bit awkward. My nephew Trent said you spoke to him when he visited my mother. Mother became very confused, very upset. I'm sure there's a better way to facilitate this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Well, I propose that all further interviews be coordinated by me and conducted at my offices. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Thank you for your offer, Mr. Wellesley. It's very nice of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Not at all. I'll give you my number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Hold on. I, too, have a "however." Thank you for your offer; however, my detectives will conduct their investigation in any manner they see fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Captain, I can get the commissioner on the phone in under a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, tell him I said hi and I really could use a raise. I think we're done here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it. They're circling the wagons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Awesome!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ignore, accept, ignore... Accept, ignore...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, Mother, come on! Accept the man's friend request, already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Using that old photo was a horrible idea. Why didn't you stop me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since when have I had the power to stop you from doing anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What will Chet think if he expects 1980s Martha, and, pfft, present-day Martha shows up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You tell anyone I said this, and I'll deny it. And I'm only gonna say it once. 1980s Martha was pretty great, but present-day Martha is pretty spectacular, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Did you just accept that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, take it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I cannot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, no. Come on...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But since it's done, why don't you take a visit to Chet's page, and see what he looks like nowadays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh, just like this? Press that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, good... Well, that's Chet, but how old is that photo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turnabout is fair play, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Chet Palaburn. What are you thinking, man?</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>City workers brought the coffin in an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Winston didn't spare any pennies with this box of wood. This is the Bentley of caskets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shopping ahead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Research. Derrick Storm, in Storm Warning, finds a murder weapon buried in a coffin a year before the murder occurs. Of course, who am I talking to? You know this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Back in the non-fiction section, we have a real casket that's been sealed for ten years, so there's gonna be some serious decomposition. When I crack this open, expect the foulest of foul stenches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Set?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is the body missing or did you just pull of an awesome magic trick? You are amazing, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Nope. No prints. Whoever removed Olivia's remains was careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do these people manage to stay one step ahead of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Olivia's aunt said it was an open-casket funeral. So her body must have been in here at one point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The mortuary company must have switched out the bodies between the funeral and the burial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but the company's out of business, so there's no way of finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Winston had to have paid to get rid of the body, just in case Brady ever wanted to come clean with the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm. Looks like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This guy's got contingency plans for his contingency plans. Feels like we're battling a super villain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Hey. Excuse me, dynamic duo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>What am I doing with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it depends. What can you get for a secondhand casket these days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll call Olivia's family and find out what they want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously, though, I wonder what you could get for a slightly-used coffin. That thing is top of the line. Did you check the drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>What drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>High-end coffins often have a small drawer hidden somewhere in the lid. That way, families can place mementos in there, or psychotic killers can hide evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing suspicious, it's just a bunch of family photographs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that button say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like a political button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Edna Debiasse. Was Edna Debiasse Olivia's mother? Let me borrow your magnifying glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't have a magnifying glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn't that standard issue for detectives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Not since Sherlock Holmes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>We can use mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course. Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Casper Wellesley, Senate '78."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Olivia's mother worked on the campaign. All roads lead to Wellesley.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you looking at porn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I use Ryan's computer for that. I've been searching a periodical database. Look what I found. In this article, it talks about how during his 1978 Senate run, Casper had his sons, Blake and Winston, heading up his campaign headquarters in Ithaca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where Olivia's mom worked. She and Winston had to have crossed paths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. Now why would Winston keep that from us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We ran all the guards' names off that duty roster you got us from Brady's prison. He's the only one that red-flagged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Name's Patterson. Made a deposit last month for $5,000 cash. Then the day Brady was killed, he makes another deposit in cash. This time for ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>If there's anything I hate, it's a dirtbag in uniform.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So where you guys at with Winston Wellesley's alibi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We have a few leads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Keep pushing on that. I'll push on this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Wellesley, we are going to find out the truth. And the amount of dust that we kick up doing that is entirely up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I do seem to recall making her acquaintance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're telling us half-truths again. We already know that you paid for Olivia's funeral. We know that you knew her mom. Either you start telling me the truth, or you're gonna spend the last few weeks of your brother's campaign issuing denials after I release what I know to the press.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Fine. I knew her mother. After her mother passed, Olivia set about to unravel the mystery of her origins. Olivia was clever. She put together the clues, found out her father was a Wellesley. A Wellesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Actually, truth is, I'm Olivia's father. I know. I had the same look on my face when Olivia told me ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Olivia's mother didn't tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Mm-mmm. Didn't tell Olivia, either. I was just on the verge of telling everyone when she... She was tragically killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is a tragedy when a father kills his daughter, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you know about Olivia's missing body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Nothing! That's obscene! Who would do something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You. So no one would ever find out the truth of who she really was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I didn't kill her and I certainly didn't hide her body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yet, ten years after her death, you're still trying to hide her existence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Well, you have to understand, I have a family to protect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Olivia was family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Winston Wellesley, you did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He might have, but we don't have the evidence to prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's because he didn't. We were able to verify Winston's alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He really was home alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, he was home, but he wasn't alone. Winston had some romantic company that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then if he had an alibi, why didn't he just say so from the start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe because of who his romantic company was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stanley Jenkins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is Stanley a unisex name now, or is Winston...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gay? Uh, yeah, he's gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He lied to us. Who is he protecting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he said it himself. Family.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You have to understand that this young woman, Olivia, I hardly knew her. Maybe I shook her hand at the party, but that's all. And now you're telling me her mother and I worked at the same campaign 30 years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You and your brother were in Ithaca July and August of '78. Olivia was born May '79. That's nine months later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your brother claimed paternity, but I think we all know that's highly unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Winston, what the hell is going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Blake, it's time to get the lawyers involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>What did you know about this, Winston?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>This is not the time or the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I never saw Edna after that summer. She never told me anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you admit to sleeping with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>She must have not wanted to rock the boat, hurt my father's campaign with a scandal involving his son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Blake, you've said enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I just found out I had a daughter I never knew about. A daughter who was murdered and whose killer apparently is still at large. Why did you tell the police you were her father? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, the question is, why did he tell Olivia that ten years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You have to understand, Blake, this was during the first Senate run. Scandal would have killed the campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>I lost the damn election anyway. You had no right to make that decision without me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>We were only looking out for your best interests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We? Winston, who is "we"?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Mother, do you remember Olivia? Olivia Debiasse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Of course I do. I have my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Wellesley, we need to a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Who are you? Blake, that's not Olivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Yes, Mother. This is a police detective investigating...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Oh, yes. My ring was stolen. It was very expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, ma'am. Um, but before we can deal with that, we need to ask you a few questions about Olivia Debiasse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Olivia. Came to me looking for a father, so I gave her Winston. A child would go a long way to butch up his image.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>But she was my daughter, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>You were too special. You're going to be a senator, maybe even President someday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mrs. Wellesley, what happened to Olivia the night of her murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Ooh! So many questions about... I don't care for questions. Olivia questioned me. Ugh! The gall of that girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>FRANK DAVIS</speaker><content>Mr. Wellesley, your mother is ill. She can't handle this...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Oh, shut it, Frank! I can handle anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>FRANK DAVIS</speaker><content>It's dangerous for her to get this riled up. I'm getting her medication from the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>What does any of this have to do with my stolen ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>WINSTON WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Mother, did you go to Olivia's apartment that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Well, she crossed me, had to be stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>BLAKE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>What did you do, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Wellesley, did you kill Olivia Debiasse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>LENANNE WELLESLEY</speaker><content>Kill her? Why would I kill her? No. I said, "Take care of it," and it was taken care of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who did you ask to take care of it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, well, well. If it isn't Frank Davis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>FRANK DAVIS</speaker><content>Sorry, pal. Got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I don't think so, pal. I just spent the better part of the day sweating a guard named Patterson who works in the prison where Brady Thompson was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>FRANK DAVIS</speaker><content>I don't know any Brady Thompson and I don't know any Patterson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That's funny, 'cause he knows you. Said that you paid him to monitor Brady Thompson's calls about a package.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. No, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Said that you paid him to have a lifer put a shiv in Brady Thompson's back. Now you tell me how I got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Cuffs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Frank was the family hitman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>More like the family fixer. He cleaned up all types of dirt for Senator Wellesley back in the day. He knows where all the bodies are buried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And which ones need to be dug up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And then after he got rid of Olivia on Mrs. Wellesley's orders, he called around to all his low-life connections until he found someone desperate enough to cut a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why, after ten years, would he suddenly stop paying Brady to do his jail time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>When Mrs. Wellesley lost her faculties, Blake was granted power of attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Frank couldn't get the money to make the payments anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he stopped, figuring Brady would just disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And when he found out Brady had evidence to prove his innocence, Frank panicked. He stole Mrs. Wellesley's ring and hocked it to finance his plan to shut Brady up permanently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By the way, I took a look at the precinct's numbers. Three closed cases puts us just over the mandated case closure rate. Right in time for the review tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You know what's even better than that? After ten years, I can call Olivia's aunt and tell her that we really got the guy. Finally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you get to give the messenger's sister some closure, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Though I don't suppose having answers makes it any easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It does. In time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I can't believe how many lives were ruined over one woman's need to protect her family's reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You will never have this problem. Between Grams and myself, our family reputation's already in ruins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm. Lucky me.</content></utterance>
