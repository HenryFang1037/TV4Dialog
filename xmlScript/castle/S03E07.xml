</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had a dream. I was floating on a lily pad and the Swedish bikini team was reciting positive reviews of Naked Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, well, that must have been lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Why are you telling us this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, because of you, my Swedish paradise turned into a wailing cat shelter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We were doing voice exercises to strengthen abdominal breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At 5 a.m.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Preparation is the foundation of an inspired audition, ah-ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I mentioned to Gram last night that I was thinking about trying out for Grease at my school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, the old Gram-goes-overboard-because-acting-is-in-your-bones routine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Apparently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Rookie move, telling her about the audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I wasn't sure I'd have time with all my other clubs, but I thought it might be fun. I didn't know she'd wake me up when it was still dark outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>An actor learns to make sacrifices for his craft. Besides, we'll all have plenty of time to sleep when we're dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Speaking of dead. Castle. No! No, no, don't be silly, of course I was up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Geez, what's the big hurry? Victim's not going anywhere, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This one's different. Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Heard we got an officer down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep, that's the word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't know, but a cab driver called 9-1-1 after he parked and stopped for a smoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Let's see. Single gunshot wound to the chest, and our guy isn't wearing his kevlar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mind if I step in there for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's from the 116 in Queens. This is an old style badge, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe he's old school? Didn't want to give up the badge he built his career on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Castle, he's mid-20s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You ever heard of a brilliant doctor named Doogie Howser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's fake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's tequila.  It's cheap tequila. And he needed a refill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, a squirt gun and an old badge. Clearly he's not a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he was impersonating one to prey on vulnerable women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Armed with a tequila pistol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Actually, I think women were preying on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tear-away pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's a stripper? Not finding any ID. He does have a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of all the cases in the city, and it's a big city, you catch a male stripper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, luck of the draw, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I-- I'm just saying. Just...stand... Shotgun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you're the only one here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. This place reminds me of my first dorm room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Victim's name is Derek Brookner. He's 27.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wrote an address on the back of this deposit slip. 423 West 59th, 4B. That's right around the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His body was found halfway between that location and this car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you want to bet that's where he was coming from?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, open up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Still sleeping, go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Wow. Wow. That, hey, whoa. They make cakes in that shape? Tha--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>SARAH LIEBERMAN</speaker><content>Another stripper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>JAMIE RUIZ</speaker><content>Whoo! Take it off! Whoo! Take it off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BLONDE BACHELORETTE</speaker><content>Mm-hmm!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>JAMIE RUIZ</speaker><content>Take it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ladies, I am not a stripper. Though, I can understand how you'd make that mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. The ones with the real guns. We're here to investigate the murder of Derek Brookner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We believe he was your entertainment for last night's soir√©e.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Officer McNaughty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to know the exact time that he arrived and left yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>It was dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>SARAH LIEBERMAN</speaker><content>And his dance was long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>JAMIE RUIZ</speaker><content>That's not all that was long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let's pack it up. I think a trip down to the station will jog everyone's memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Can we stop and get brunch on the way?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Miss Lieberman, do you remember anything about last night?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Derek was still wearing his costume when he was killed last night and he never made it to his car, which makes your party the last place that he was seen alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>JAMIE RUIZ</speaker><content>Well, he seemed fine when he left, right? I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>JAMIE RUIZ</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were there any problems at the party? Any jealous husbands or boyfriends that showed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>No, it was-- it was just the girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who arranged the gig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>I did. Ja- Jamie's always had a thing for cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Might interest you to know I'm an assistant volunteer homicide detective myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How'd you set it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>The same way you'd order a pizza. I called this place that I found online, Mucho Men, and gave my credit card. Three hundred bucks an hour to send my best friend off in style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he mention where he was going after that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>We were all wasted by the time he showed up. I mean, he could have told me his life story and I wouldn't remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A bachelorette party, male stripper, loads of alcohol? One of you had to be taking pictures.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, here is the last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>I figured Jamie could refer back to these when she's old and bored of her marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Ugh, tequila shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Treating him like a piece of meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>It's what he's paid for. He had fun, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. Stop on that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it's a good thing you took 30 pictures of that one pose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you enhance the background? Over there behind the group. Who is that woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>Oh, that's Camille. She's a friend of Jamie's from high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It looks as though she and Derek know each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>She never mentioned anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you enhance her face? She wasn't at the apartment this morning. Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>KATHLEEN PARK</speaker><content>She left. Right after Officer McNaughty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out Camille Roberts has a record. Five years ago, an ex-boyfriend filed a restraining order against her after she threw all his stuff out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As a man who's dated several rapid boilers, I can safely say "been there."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but a restraining order doesn't mean that she's our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, except that her ex-boyfriend happens to be our vic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Picked up Camille Roberts at a caf√© where she waitresses. She's in interrogation room one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, what did we find from Derek's apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mostly just old movie posters and a bunch of Donald Trump books about finance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Derek dreams about being an entrepreneur, or maybe he's just a fan of Celebrity Apprentice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There was a day planner with nothing in it but a business card for a guy named Jesse Mandalay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, run it. I'll talk to Camille.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>This is like a bad dream. I can't believe he's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you leave the party right after Derek did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>I needed to get out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where did you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>Home. I just wanted to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn't see him afterwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>I turned the corner, but he was gone. Wait, you don't think I had something to do with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Camille, he had a restraining order against you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>That was years ago. It was just a big misunderstanding. Look, Derek broke my heart, but then I got over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This doesn't look like the face of a person who got over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>When he walked into the party and started ripping his clothes off, it upset me, but I didn't kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, why don't we just go over the facts. You had a volatile relationship with him. You left the party the same time that Derek left, and then he turned up dead. So, why don't you just tell me what was really going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>Nothing. I just couldn't believe he was stripping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why was that a shock to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>We met in acting class. He was the one everyone thought was gonna hit it big. When I confronted him about giving up on his dream, he said he was stripping because he was so desperate for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did he tell you why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CAMILLE ROBERTS</speaker><content>He had some other recurring gig, but he said he had to quit 'cause it was gonna kill him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My instinct says it's not her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Mine too, but have CSU check the clothes she was wearing for gunshot residue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Any luck tracking down the gig that he was telling Camille about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Derek has a low rent theatrical agent who says he hasn't booked anything in over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He just e-mailed Derek's acting reel. Here's a taste of his illustrious career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ACTRESS</speaker><content>Hey there, I'm just stopping a few couples to see if they've ever heard of a product called Prolong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>DEREK BROOKNER</speaker><content> Are you kidding? We just started using Prolong. Now, things are really looking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He also did serious work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>DEREK BROOKNER</speaker><content>Give me all your money, and whatever parts you got out there in that garage, and I'll consider not puttin' one in your noggin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Damn, I can see why the guy had to strip to pay his bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I guess it's safe to say that the gig that he was telling Camille about had nothing to do with his acting pursuits. So, you guys head off to Mucho Men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mucho Men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's the place that booked him for the bachelorette party. See if he had any regular stripping gigs or troubles there.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's not that handsome. You want my opinion? Three hundred bucks an hour, little steep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>As a person in this room that's seen everything under the sheet? Bargain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else did you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Take a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Your vic has hair that's been recently dyed gray. Looks like temporary hair dye that hasn't completely washed out yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, most men color their hair to cover the gray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, some women want Officer McNaughty, and some want an older guy who knows mutual funds. You know, daddy issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's more likely he was coloring it for an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Speaking of hair, this is the more important hair that I found on your vic's clothing. That could belong to our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Long blond hair. Well, this could have come from one of the women at the bachelorette party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That's what I thought until I had it tested. It came back positive for testosterone and anabolic steroids. Your blondie is a man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Listen. Stu, you want my guys oiled up in euro booty shorts for the montage pool deck launch, you're gonna need to meet me halfway here, buddy. Hey, be my guest. Shop around. It's a fair rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Listen, I gotta go. I got guys here.  My apologies. Promoters are always a pain in my ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lloyd Saunders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>I'm already up to my ears in A-Rods. But, uh, your friend here...I got women requesting that skinny Twilight dude like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>They're one-size-fits-all. We can pad if need be. Bathroom's down the hall if you're shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. NYPD. We have some questions about Derek Brookner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>My mistake. We're doing open auditions today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can assure you, this would fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>That's what they all say. What about Derek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Wow. Derek was one of my best guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We think he took a job that might have got him into trouble. What kind of work did you book for him in the last month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>He did the occasional, uh, handsome guest at rich people parties. Other than that, it was all, uh, bachelorette or rowdy birthday party stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about any male parties?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Nah. Derek was a women only guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He had contact with a blond haired man who was on steroids the night he was killed. Any idea who that might be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Well, it could have been someone at his other job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What other job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>In addition to the private gigs, he also danced at a club called The Package Store couple nights a week. Most of those guys are juicing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anyone he didn't get along with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>People think woman are catty, but, uh, from what Derek said, those guys would make Showgirls look like an Afterschool Special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thanks for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>LLOYD SAUNDERS</speaker><content>Hey, if, uh, you change your mind, I'll provide fangs and some hair gel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Eh...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>MUCHO MAN</speaker><content>You like my sexy abs? Come see me at The Package Store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All of them are buff enough to be juicing, but none of them have long hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Certainly not long blond hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe these are old photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It's possible they change their style based on the latest trend. The booking agent mentioned the Twilight look is big right now. Maybe the Fabio look's making a comeback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, there's one surefire way to find out. Oh, Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can't believe you got dressed up for this. Tell me again why Ryan and Esposito couldn't come with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We all agreed, as Volunteer Assistant Homicide Detective, you could really sink your teeth into this avenue of investigation. And they called "not it."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, ever since I've been following you, I've been dreaming of the day that you'd say, "Let's go to the strip club and get this dirt bag." I just never imagined it would feel like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me know if you need any singles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It's sad, really. A guy comes to town looking for his big break, dreams of making it in the Apple. What does he get for his trouble? The city chews him up and spits him out. Doesn't seem right, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn right, it doesn't seem right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, all I think he wanted was a little respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's all about respect, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just trying to make ends meet, he ends up face down in a stairwell...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>...wearing a G-string. All right, here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Up to his ears in A-Rods? I got an A-Rod for that son of a *****. Three years varsity ball, two years Special Forces triathlon, and NYPD police calendar 2007. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It was a group photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I got letters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, three. Two of them from your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>One of them was from my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Twilight, my ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, honey! Oh, you found me. I was just telling Denise here about you. This is, uh, my girlfriend, whose idea it was to come here tonight. She's very adventurous. You have no idea. There's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God you found me. Oh, my God, these women are like piranha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, listen, I just talked to one of the bartenders who confirms the booking agent's story that Derek was having troubles with one of the other dancers. Apparently, some guy named Hans was upset that Derek was getting the headliner shift. That gives us evidence and motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let's go backstage, grab us some Hans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No need to, honey. He's in the next act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Firemen? Really? It's not a little clich√©? Oh, God. Haven't these guys got that memo about the correlation between sun tanning and skin cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you just relax, Castle? We got to figure out which one is Hans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, please come off the stage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. No, not you. Just Hans. Guys, knock it off, okay? I'm a cop. I'm a real cop. Look, it's not funny. Now cool it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Too much?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Derek was a little *****. Do you know how many hours he spent rehearsing our Pirates of the Caribbean routine? Hmm? Zero. He was all artsy-fartsy with his acting auditions this and play rehearsals that. Hans Von Mannschaft is the one doing the real work out there every night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hans Von Mannschaft? That's a hell of a stage name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>I'll have you know, I come from a long line of proud Von Mannschafts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And have any of them served time for murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Careful, Hans, your New Jersey is starting to show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>This place is about fantasy. Women come here to escape. It's just part of the act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does that include getting rid of the competition? Derek was found shot and killed last night, and we found one of your hairs on his clothes. You just admitted the two of you were rivals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Rival? Lady, I spend days with women shoving bills down my shorts. Do you really think I killed somebody over that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That doesn't change the fact that we can place you at the scene of the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Because of my hair? All that proves is that we keep our costumes in the same big closet backstage. Hell, I'm using Minoxidil twice a day just to keep it on my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>I was onstage doing shows from eight till one. There are over 100 women who witnessed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His alibi's as hard as his abs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Did you talk to his girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>Some rich cougar who was obsessed with him. It was obvious Derek was using her for the money. But I guess he got fed up with her and kicked her to the curb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>HANS</speaker><content>She always sent expensive bouquets to his dressing room.  Und then last week, for ze first time in months, no flowers. *pout face*</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, what's up? You run out of singles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Hans was right. Found a flower shop that confirmed weekly deliveries for the past four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I knew if we beat on Mannschaft something would pop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who were they sent to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They were charged to an AmEx belonging to Rebecca Dalton, 48. She lives at 63rd and Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Check this out. Fortune 500 lists Rebecca Dalton's husband as having a publishing empire in 2005. Says here that Rebecca used to be a runway model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's married. Juicy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mm-mm. Not anymore. Her husband died a couple of years ago, left his entire fortune to his grieving wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even more juicy. Rebecca marries young, spends her 20s and 30s under the thumb of a rich, yet domineering husband. Well, he dies, leaving our aging beauty finally free from the shackles of a loveless marriage. One night she's out with her ex-model posse. She meets a very charming, very handsome, Derek. Well, for the first time in years, she feels alive again. The relationship reaches its inevitable conclusion when Derek meets someone closer to his own age. Well, the-- the heartache has Rebecca so distraught that she kills Derek in a jealous rage. If she couldn't have him, well then, no one could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you go home and watch Sunset Boulevard before your little trip to The Package Store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for your always entertaining stories, but I think we will get a lot closer to the truth if we just ask Rebecca a few questions tomorrow morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's good though, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I liked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mm? Yeah.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Are you guys celebrating with root beer floats and nobody told me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I wish. They narrowed the part of Sandy down to Kelly Burton and yours truly. We're taking a little break, but I'm really nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That's why we're running lines in costume. Tomorrow it'll be second nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I see you dug up your time capsule to resurrect those pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I will have you know, I had some of my best memories happen in these pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aaaand ew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I'm off to bed. Big day tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay, darling. Sleep well. Oh. Whatever happens, I am so proud of her. She is fearless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, mother, I think you're a really good influence on Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What's with you, kiddo? Fever? Delirium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, I'm serious. You have always been...dedicated. And that-- that can't have been easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, it hasn't always been days of wine and roses. I had to take a lot of less than prestigious jobs to ply my craft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Such as?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ugh, lord. I played an elf, Santa's Village. Uh, Lady Liberty. Lady Liberty outside some low rent tax service. And then-- oh, no. The worst job. The worst job I ever had. I was terrible at it. They hated me. It just-- I-- I was-- it was absolutely the-- just completely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Secretary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You'd be terrible at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Awful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sure many a pretty boy has walked this hall. Doesn't take them long to realize they're trapped in a strangling embrace of an aging spinster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we should talk with her before you start writing the Lifetime movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. Quick casting idea. Ashton and Demi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, we're here to speak with Rebecca Dalton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>Please, come in. I'm Miss Dalton's attorney, Michael Grant. I'll be sitting in on the interview.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>I bumped into Derek at a fundraiser. He later admitted that he had been hired by the host to mingle and encourage people to bid on the silent auction, but it was too late, I already liked him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when you found out he was a stripper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>I never found out. He told me. He never hid any of that from me. It gave him the freedom to pursue his acting career, audition during the day, and I respected his tenacity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What caused the breakup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>The relationship had run its course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That sounds like something you would say when you're lying either to yourself or to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>You don't really think I had anything to do with his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just find it curious that, right after you've split up, he's found dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who broke it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>My client did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>Last week, he asked my client to borrow $25,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>I've learned it's never a good idea to mix relationships with money. Intentions get foggy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why did he need the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>He wouldn't say. And, to make matters worse, he seemed distant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You thought he was cheating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>It occurred to me. And I'm not proud of it, but I had Michael hire a private investigator. I had to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>When my client saw the photographs, she realized that Derek was mixed up with some disreputable people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what made you think it was a bad element?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>Because Derek didn't hang out with people like that. He was a good kid from Michigan. If they had something to do with his murder, I'd have taken my decision back and given him the money in a heartbeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna need to see those photos.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The PI took a picture of Derek talking to this woman, and then he followed her to the next location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Derek is outside his apartment talking to Bombshell McGee, what's so dangerous about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Ryan, can you pull up Derek's acting reel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Man, once was bad enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>DEREK BROOKNER</speaker><content>Give me all your money, and whatever parts you got out there in that garage, and I'll consider not puttin' one in your noggin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's the same guy as the mug shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Billy Grimm, leader of the Visigoths' motorcycle gang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Billy Grimm's rap sheet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Extortion, assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Derek's episode of America's Most Dangerous Criminals aired, Grimm had an attempted murder warrant out. Apparently some guy owed him money, so he chained him to the back of his bike and dragged him down the LIE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Why isn't this psycho in jail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was. As a matter of fact, he was caught because of Derek's re-enactment on the show. But the guy he chained to his bike had a change of heart, refused to testify. So, Grimm was recently released from jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if this guy was such a whack job, what was Derek doing talking to one of the members of his gang?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think I can answer that. When Grimm was arrested, a reporter asked him how he felt about being brought to justice by a TV show. He swore vengeance against those who put him in jail. Especially, and Grimm says, "That actor that made me look like a clown."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can tell you this about Visigoths from my gang task force days, they're serious about their colors. These patches they wear on their vests, they're not varsity letters. They got to spill blood to get them. And some guy wearing them on national TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, she was setting him up...for murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Relax, Castle, he's on a chain. NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>VISIGOTH</speaker><content>This your old lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>This is a private establishment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then, we'll try to keep this private, Billy Grimm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Bobby! Yo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need to ask you a few questions about your association with Derek Brookner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>I've never heard of the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I make one phone call and auto theft detail's down here checking VIN numbers. They find so much as a stolen tail light, you're violated. You remember him now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Now I do. Seemed like a good kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's dead. And I'm willing to bet that you had something to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Derek wore the colors and you got popped because of the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's why you put a contract out on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Well, I might have been a little pissed off. But the kid came with respect. He brought a donation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A donation? What are you, the Salvation Army?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Well, I was surprised too, but I guess Derek felt 25Gs might help bring down my old red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you really expect me to believe that a struggling actor had enough money to give you 25 grand out of nowhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>That's what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where did he get the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>I didn't ask to see his friggin' tax return. Ain't my business how he got the money. He brought the cash, and that was good enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Aren't you forgetting the part about the extortion? The part where you asked your girlfriend to deliver a message that Derek had to pay you 25 grand? You gave him a week to do it, he couldn't scrape together the money, and so... you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Babe, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>MANDY CARSON</speaker><content>I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>What the hell were you doing talking to that b****?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>MANDY CARSON</speaker><content>Listen, when you got out of jail, I got nervous you were gonna do something stupid. So, I went to talk to the kid. Told him, if he didn't want any trouble, he'd bring you a preemptive donation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>So, you warned him? That's why he showed up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>MANDY CARSON</speaker><content>I couldn't stand the thought of losing you again. The only way you're going back to jail is over my dead body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>BILLY GRIMM</speaker><content>Pookiebear, that is the most romantic thing I've ever heard, baby.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Billy's alibi checked out. Bartender confirmed that he was shooting pool till close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and we talked to our CI, and there's no word of our victim hitting up any of the usual loan sharks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what I want to know? Is how a stripper comes up with that kind of cash in such a hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cash in gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you watch way too many infomercials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I also checked his account at JLP Bank Corp. He never carried an account balance of more than a couple thousand dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. If Derek had an account with JLP Bank Corp, why was there a deposit slip for Rampart Federal in his car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's run down withdrawals for 25 grand from Rampart Federal branches for the day that Derek paid Billy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don't know how you missed that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Rampart Federal on 93rd posted a transaction that size, made by Jesse Mandalay at 11:53 AM that day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Derek had a card for Jesse Mandalay tucked inside one of his books. I called the number. It was disconnected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It's possible that Mandalay was the one that loaned Derek the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Derek thought he was on a flexible payment plan, needed more time, and Mandalay killed him for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the bank is sending over the surveillance footage of Mandalay right now. Here we go. There's Mandalay taking the cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And by the looks of that suit, the loan business must be pretty lucrative. Okay, let's see this guy's face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. That's not Jesse Mandalay. That's Derek with gray hair. Jesse Mandalay is Derek.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The branch manager said that Derek withdrew money from an account called Sunfire Limited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And his alter ego, Jesse Mandalay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was the signatory, but the rest is a mystery. Sunfire is linked to an offshore account, and the only person that they can trace it to is Mandalay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The money trail leads back to a man who doesn't exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Derek was dying his hair gray, wearing fancy suits to look more distinguished, and he was reading books on finance and investment so that he could play the role of Jesse Mandalay for someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But why hire a struggling actor to play a business man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did some research on Chinese companies that would, uh, sometimes hire a-- a white man to pose as an executive at uh, ribbon cutting ceremonies, uh, shareholder meetings, just to instill confidence in investors. Likewise, uh, college students seeking venture capital will sometimes hire an older looking shill. You know, someone who looks more, uh, distinguished to help them secure money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, if Derek was hired to be the face of the company, then whoever hired him was the person behind the bank account. Let's see if we can track down any checks that were deposited into Sunfire Limited recently. If we can trace the money, maybe we can figure out if Jesse Mandalay was a role to die for.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>Yeah, that's Mandalay. 100%. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Lombardo, we need to know about the $10,000 check that you wrote him a couple of days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>Sure, best money I ever spent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was the money for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>An exciting investment opportunity. My girlfriend Sammy heard from a boyfriend Ronny, who heard from his cousin Pauly about Mr. Mandalay's presentation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was the sales pitch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>The beautiful Braverman Lofts in idyllic riverfront Hoboken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Mandalay was there himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>He gave us the awesome news that, if we put down the $10,000 that day, we could purchase the loft for $400,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A riverfront loft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>I know. Amazing, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, amazing is-- is one word for it, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>Yeah, you have to be, like, a frickin' bonehead to pass up on a deal like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did anyone else at the presentation hand over a check to Mandalay that day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BELLA LOMBARDO</speaker><content>Uh, everyone. My dad was pretty butt sore that I took the money out of my college fund, but when I explained that it would fold into the purchase price, he recognized that business smarts runs in our family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess, the, uh, contract is in the mail, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, this is it. The Braverman Lofts. And that must be the showroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ho. $400,000 for one of these? I'll take two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, let's go. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. Who's in charge here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>I am. I'm the developer, Bert Kramer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're here about Jesse Mandalay. Do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Unfortunately. If I ever see that guy again, I'm gonna bust him in the jaw for all the crap he put me through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess, he took advantage of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Damn right. Tried to sell my friggin' property like it was his. Showed up here claiming to be a real estate agent. He had this rap about all these properties he's sold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you gave him access to the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Well, he wanted to bring a caravan of clients through, and he insisted it be on a Sunday. So, I gave him the lockbox codes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you find out he wasn't legit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Ever since that day, I got people showing up saying they got the Mandalay deal and threatening to sue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we have reason to believe that Mandalay was working with a partner. Did anyone else contact you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>BERT KRAMER</speaker><content>Uh, no. And when the tents folded up, it was radio silence. But I did call some of the other developers and, sure enough, this Mandalay guy brought caravans to their properties. Now they're dealing with the same mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any brochures? I'm looking for a place. Mine blew up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ten grand a pop all over Jersey? That adds up quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't understand why Derek was still working as a stripper the night that he was killed if he was involved in a scam that was raking in that much money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because he wasn't the one raking in all the dough. He was just the actor hired for his looks and his personality that charmed the investors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, all along, Derek sees his partner taking the money to the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when he gets in trouble with the bikers, and suddenly he needs cash...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He raids the bank account for the 25 grand that he needs, and his partner figures it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which leads to a heated confrontation where he admits to borrowing the money, but he says he's pulling out of the scam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. Got it, thanks.  Ryan and Esposito did a little digging and they found the real owner of the Sunfire account that Derek used to withdraw the money. The articles of incorporation were signed by our very own orchid-loving widow, Rebecca Dalton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shut the front door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, you sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, it's all right here in black and white. We tracked the money from the real estate scam to this offshore account in the Cayman Islands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So, Derek decides he's done playing the Mandalay role and, because he knows too much, the only option is to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You were right. I was able to confirm Rebecca Dalton's whereabouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get a warrant to search for the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As someone who's written just about every ending in the book, can I just say...? Amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can say that after we get the confession.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Miss Dalton, we did a thorough search of your finances. You've lost quite a lot of money since your husband passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>My client doesn't need to defend her spending habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She does if it's relevant to my case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>What does my money have to do with Derek's death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Everything, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's see, there is a clothing line that never took off. A failed jewelry business. I mean, should I go on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>That doesn't make me a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it was only a matter of time until all the money was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Derek was handsome. He was charming. You knew he was a decent actor. It made him the perfect guy to present investors with an opportunity they couldn't refuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>This is wildly speculative, and your allegations are baseless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Derek took 25 grand from an account that initially led us in circles. The Sunfire account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>Well, this isn't possible. I didn't even sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>Rebecca, I'm advising you, don't say another word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>Wait a minute. September 29th. I wasn't even in the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The date it was signed, smack dab in the middle of Paris fashion week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I knew that any former model worth her salt would have been there. And, of course, after checking flight records, you were in Paris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. And, while you were drinking champagne, your lawyer was using his access to your information to create a scam in your name. Oh, he was also stealing from you, funneling the money into his offshore account. That's why your businesses failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He offered Derek a job behind your back to play Jesse Mandalay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The money was decent, but when the bikers came after Derek, he needed more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>REBECCA DALTON</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Michael. What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When you found out that Derek made an unauthorized withdrawal, you confronted him. But he knew that you couldn't go to the cops. So, he told you that he wanted out. You couldn't afford him exposing your fraud. So, you followed him from his apartment, and then killed him that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>MICHAEL GRANT</speaker><content>I'm not saying another word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you want a lawyer? Or do you want to hire an actor to play one for you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So, what happened with your struggling actor case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, they found the murder weapon at the lawyer's office. He confessed in an effort to cut a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, God, it's so sad. Poor kid was just trying to catch a break, and he kept stepping in the dog poop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You should stitch that onto a pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, hey, sweetie! Do we have a Sandra Dee in our midst?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I didn't get the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ohhh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, honey! This is the best thing that has ever happened to you. Rejection is the bedrock of a great acting career. Until an actor has suffered, he hasn't really lived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks, Gram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You're welcome. And besides, auditions are like men. There's another one right around the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, we need ice cream to ease the pain, stat. I'm going to the corner store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can I admit something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Going up against Kelly made me realize I didn't really want the part. I could see how hungry she was, and I didn't want to disappoint Gram, but I don't love it the way she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe it's not in your bones, as Gram would say. I am proud of you for trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks, Dad. And there's a silver lining. After the announcement, the drama teacher offered me stage manager. It's way more my style, and I get to keep all my after school clubs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My little overachiever. Well, congratulations on not getting the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm, smells good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come help me. Wash up. So, you need to chop these up...</content></utterance>
