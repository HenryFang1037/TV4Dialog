<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh my lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Somewhere in one of these bags is the perfect baby show gift for Jen and Ryan. I just need your help picking which one. Ready?  Ta da!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is that a bullet proof baby - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That is completely inappropriate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That – oh my.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Well then you’re going to hate the onesies that say “I’m with Officer Stupid”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard! I honestly – why can’t you just buy a simple, traditional – why is this so difficult for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not! This next one is perfect. Trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Is it a baby sized lightsaber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Please tell me that’s not the creepy robot nanny that sings Leonard Cohen lullabies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What’s wrong with Leonard Cohen lullabies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s more like Silence of the Lambs than “Mary had a little lamb”.  Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. Fortunately Alexis has purchased the perfect baby shower gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>All you have to do is sign the card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you have any idea how hard it is to find machine washable Kevlar? Why didn’t you tell me this before I went shopping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Because we would have so missed torturing you. You are our favorite reality show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m so happy I could entertain you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, Alexis. I will drop this off at the precinct a little later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Too bad you can’t go to the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, well, Beckett got baby showers in the breakup, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know, that’s funny. Because you recently – you just, uh, don’t be so tortured by all that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Well, you know, Beckett asked for some time, so I’m just giving it to her. Every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sometimes twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I said, this is nice. Thank you so much for doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So our vic is a Russian national by the name of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Grigory Mishkin. I spoke to the police commissioner. He’s the son of a consulate officer, which means this might get political.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh. Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Lanie. So, what’ve we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Throat was slashed. Live temp puts the time of death between 2 and 4AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea what our victim was doing in an abandoned building in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. His pockets were turned out but his wallet and his cell phone were found nearby. So the killer searched him but there’s no way to know if anything was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what do you make of these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like ink that was transferred from whatever was in his shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See if the lab can reconstruct the characters. He might have been killed because of whatever was inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Howdy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Howdy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Um, yo’s getting played out, so I thought I’d try something new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well you might want to keep trying, because howdy is just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Well, I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, by the way, there’s a homeless guy that was camped out down the block. He heard a car roar to life and burn rubber about 2AM so I’m pulling street cam footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, keep me posted. I’m going to head off to Russia and talk to next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Russia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, legally a consulate is considered foreign territory, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. See you later.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>PAVEL OBORIN</speaker><content>I’m Counsel General Pavel Oborin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain Kate Beckett, NYPD. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Oborin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Yes, Captain. I will take you to Grigory’s father, Sergei. He hopes for a quick resolution and to see justice served.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>As do we. Now, is it possible that Grigory’s father’s consulate work put his son at risk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Oh, Mr. Mishkin writes economic forecasts for commodities. It’s hardly a thing worth killing for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did you know Grigory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Oh yes. I watched him grow up. You see, for us this is very personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Then you will be amenable to my request to have a Russian diplomatic security officer assigned to the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Oborin, I appreciate the offer but my detectives are the best in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Oh, I do not doubt that. But, still, I must insist. A spirit of cooperation is in everyone’s best interest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> My condolences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>SERGEI MISHKIN</speaker><content> Thank you.  Oh, please. Can you tell me what happened with Grigory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, we’re not exactly sure just yet. Do you have any idea what he was doing in an abandoned building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>No. I wish I did. Grigory hasn’t been himself since we lost in mother, Anya, in a car accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>The last months have been a downward spiral of drinking, drugs –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he could have been meeting with a dealer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>I wouldn’t know. But the new crowd he was spending time with would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what crowd is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>Diplo-brats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>Spoiled children of foreign officers who flaunt the law with diplomatic immunity. They do what they like and nobody can stop them. Grigory got lost in their world.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Meet the notorious diplo-brats of New York City. We arrest them but immunity means no prosecution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sounds like catch and release but without the cooler full of beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m searching through all their files to see if there’s a connection back to our vic, but so far nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, did you hear that the Russians are sending one of their own to ride along with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Vasiliy Zhirov.  He’s part of the Russian diplomatic security service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Red Heat is coming here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, Castle!  Bearing gifts, I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is your starter kit for little Kevin. Except for the Macallan 25 and the ear plugs. Those are for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re a dear and thoughtful man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.  So a Russian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Ivan Drago’s in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I hear those guys are like automatons. Strictly business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if Boris is coming could Natasha be far behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s going to be trouble for the big moose and little squirrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s so –  He’s right behind me, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>VASILIY ZHIROV</speaker><content>I know you. You’re Richard Castle, no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Such an honor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The honor is mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I love your books. Many a flights to Moscow have been kept company by Derrick Storm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>And Nikki Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Also known as Captain Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It is also an honor to meet the muse, the inspiration –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, welcome to the Twelfth, Mr. Zhirov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Such a famous crime solving duo. It will be a privilege to watch you work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh well, sadly we don’t work together any longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>But it cannot be. Beckett without Castle is like uh … Boris without Natasha. It’s like Starsky without The Hutch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s just Hutch. Not The Hutch.  It’s not – you said The Hutch.  Uh, street cams weren’t able to get our getaway car but shot spotter was tripped by the engine noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>What is a spot shotter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shot spotter. An audio surveillance system designed to detect gunshots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And noises over one hundred and twenty decibels can also activate the system so we’ve got a recording.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know what? I’ll just have to get experts to tell me what kind of make and model –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No need. That is a Lamborghini Huracan. Yeah, the V10s are notorious for crackling and popping like a breakfast cereal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jurgen Kass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The son of the Finnish ambassador has that very same car.  He also has a history of drug and assault charges. Though, of course, all those charges were dropped due to his diplomatic immunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, murder doesn’t get a pass so pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, you have already broken open the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. You know, I’d be glad to stick around –  – but I actually have some business to attend to, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should go.  So …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>JURGEN KASS</speaker><content>What’s up, 5-O?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, Jurgen. I don’t think you understand the trouble you’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>Oh, please. I ain’t in trouble. I am trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh yeah, you’re a regular Scarface.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sit down.  Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>You think you scare me, 5-O? Please. I could put my little man on this table and there’s not one thing you could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If I see your little man then we’re going to have a little problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>This guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>You’re worried I’m here to make troubles for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … no. No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Captain, do you really want to start off this friendship with a lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. The truth? A young man was murdered. And I don’t’ want politics to get in the way of catching the bastard who did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I admire your passion. Very Russian. Rest assured, I do not wish to interfere in your case. I’m as far from the political animal as one could get. Frankly, I am excited to learn from Katherine the Great. May I share a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I have never been to New York and I was hoping there will be some down time to see the sights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Uh, yes. Of course. In fact, I can bring you in for the big, important moments, otherwise the city is yours to explore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You went for a little ride in the warehouse district.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We know you were at that abandoned building last night, Jurgen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You met Grigory there to sell him drugs. And then when he stiffed you, you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content> All right. I confess. I confess that uh … I’m rich, b*tches.  Say cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What is wrong with you? What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re the prime suspect in a murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>You know I have diplomatic immunity. To charge me your state department has to ask my government permission, which they have not. But um … this has been awesome.  Peace out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>The suspect is leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, cases don’t always get solved as quickly as they do in Castle’s books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>What will you do next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just keep digging until we find some hard evidence on Jurgen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Means that now might be a good time to go do that thing that we talked about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where’s he going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sightseeing. Looks like he won’t be a problem after all.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle Investigations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>This is Vasiliy. I have most important news to discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … listen, if it’s about the case –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You see, I’m a writer, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I have an idea for a Nikki Heat novel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Of course you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Let’s meet for coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me – let me – I’m – I’m going to check my schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vasiliy Zhirov wants me to meet him for coffee. What should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keep him happy. The more time he spends with you the less he’s going to be hanging over my shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if I keep him happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Then I will keep you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Done.  Vasiliy!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>The title of the book will be Heat and Ice. And Ice is the code name for the new Russian superspy who’s Nikki Heat’s new nemesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Enemy from the East and new a Cold War?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Cold war, yes! But though Heat and Ice are rivals their sexual attraction is like nuclear fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vasiliy, I have to admit you are not at all what I expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>You thought I would be like Red Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>That is old Russia. I am new Russia!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t that our suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>What a coincidence. Your detective friends didn’t have much luck questioning him. I wonder if we can do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, maybe we should leave it alone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we shouldn’t interfere –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Hey. Pick up book, young man. This here is Richard Castle, one of the great mystery writers of our time. And he has a few questions for you about the murder of Grigory Mishkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>Ugh, get lost, Ivan. If the cops can’t touch me what are you guys going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Ah, diplomatic immunity. It is like a soft fur coat that keeps you warm and cozy. In America.  But, my friend, Russian justice plays by different rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>What is –  Russian justice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Oh, how should I describe this? Oh, yes. When you’re in Ibiza next month you might wake up on the beach. Without your feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>Okay. I didn’t tell this to the cops because my father gets furious when I hang with Russians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>Our countries have bad history, you know. Look, I dropped Grigory off at that building after we took care of a little business, but I never went in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of business? Drug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>No. He owed me a ticket to a reception at the Russian consulate.  It will be wall to wall Russian models.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes. Russian women are devastatingly beautiful. Tell me, what did you give Grigory in return for the tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>A manual. On how to hack the computer of a Cherokee automobile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>VASILY</speaker><content>This is a strange request.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did he want with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>He didn’t say. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was he meeting in this building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Have a nice day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>JURGEN</speaker><content>So uh … we’re cool, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How the hell did you get Jurgen to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vasiliy helped him see the value of honesty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>What can I say? I’m a people’s person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And why would Grigory want to hack a Cherokee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, this might explain that. The lab deciphered those characters from the ink stain they found on Grigory’s shirt. It is a case number from a state trooper incident report for the car accident that killed Grigory’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess, she was driving a Cherokee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>So Grigory doesn’t think her death was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That might be what got him killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to the state trooper’s report, Anya Mishkin, and our victim’s mother, died in a single vehicle crash on Highway 9 upstate near Cold Springs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Her car hit a tree and burned sometime after 1AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, a fire would cover up any evidence of a software hack causing that crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but Castle, there’s no indication in these files that it was murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But clearly Grigory thought someone sabotaged his mother’s car in order to kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>And investigating that theory got Grigory killed by the saboteur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I couldn’t have said it better myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to financial records, four days ago Grigory stayed in a bed and breakfast near the crash site. The same one that his mom was staying in when she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Reach out to that bed and breakfast. See if they know what Grigory was up to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>So it’s left to us to talk to Grigory’s father. See if he harbored suspicions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vasiliy, uh … Castle and I don’t work together any longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes, the news of which is more than I can bear. I may have expressed my disappointment to people you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bill! What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Commissioner. No, we’re doing everything we can to assist Mr. Zhirov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve met him. He’s a – a character.  I would love to work with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would love to have Castle work with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Fantastic!  We can stop for pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>JOYCE</speaker><content>Yeah, that Russian kid stayed here last week. Poor guy was asking about his mom. She loved staying here at my bed and breakfast. What a shame about the accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you remember about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>JOYCE</speaker><content>Nice lady. Stayed here a few nights with a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you get his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>JOYCE</speaker><content>Nope. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>JOYCE</speaker><content>I can do you one better. The kid was asking the same question, so I pulled security video and got –  – this.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Mishkin, was there anything in your son or late wife’s behavior that would merit suspicion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>If there was I would have told security agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was your wife doing upstate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>Um… I believe she was having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>I don’t know. We have grown apart. But we both wanted to serve at this post so we led separate lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> We have to go someplace.  Excuse us, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll need her contact list. Along with anything else that could identify who she might have been seeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>Yes, of course. I’ll have it ready for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Communication office. Top secret. Alpha clearance only.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes. But not so cool if they catch you here.  You’ll be shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It’s no joke. We must hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It is possibly that Grigory, even though he did not work here, kept a dedicated email account on our private servers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This’ll tell us a little bit more about his investigation into his mother’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes. And there is it. I see urgent emails from emily2929 pleading for him to call her. She’s scared, states that they’re both in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The last one was sent the day he died. But who’s emily2929?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Emily Hopper. You know why you’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>This is about Grigory Mishkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was your relationship with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Ah. You’re about to lie. Don’t do it. It would not be good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>I … saw him a couple of days ago. I’d always had a thing for him, so we hooked up. But that’s it. Whatever this is about, whatever he did, I – I had nothing to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what do you think this is about, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>I don’t know. Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Emily, Grigory is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened the last time you saw him? Why did you send him emails demanding he call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>I feel asleep after he … you know. When I woke up I thought I saw him on my laptop. He denied it, but after he left I realized that he used my work login to access a client’s data.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what kind of work do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>I work with a data storage company. We archive files for business. … And some government agencies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, you need to tell me what kind of files Grigory was looking at. Whatever he saw might have gotten him killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo.  Come here.  Close the door.  Emily Hopper’s cloud storage archives old FBI files. That’s what Grigory was after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What kind of FBI files?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A 1980s Cold War operation to identify and flip Soviet sleeper agents in the US.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sleepers? I thought the Directive S was a myth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it was very real.  And the FBI’S biggest catch was KGB agent Anatoly Arkady. In ’87 he defected and went into Witness Protection as Frank Thomas.  And that’s Frank, present day, still living in the US.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is our guy from the bed and breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the woman here is Grigory’s mother, Anya Mishkin. Also a Soviet agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s a spy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is bigger than an illicit affair gone wrong. And I’m beginning to think our friendly Russian knows more than he’s telling.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Hello Vasiliy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, can I borrow Castle and Ryan for a few minutes? It’s about Ryan’s baby shower, emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>How many American men does it take to plan a baby shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um .. three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do you know if Vasiliy recognizes this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because Frank’s real name is Anatoly Arkady. He’s a defector from Russia back in the Cold War and …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>… Grigory’s mom, Anya, is a spy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. That is so coo –  – bad. That is so bad. Their relationship wasn’t romantic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not sure what their relationship was. Either way, we now know that Vasiliy’s motives cannot be trusted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A defector resurfaces, a spy dies, and her son is killed in the middle of the night. This novel writes itself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have no idea. That’s what makes it so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Frank, aka Anatoly, is the key to figuring out what’s behind these murders. So you guys dig into his life and see what you can find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you want us to do about Vasiliy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We gotta keep him as far away from this case as possible. Which mean, we need to launch Operation Nickel Tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re going to take him sightseeing. See what he knows. In the meantime, I’m going to talk to the Feds, see if they’ve got any intel on Anatoly returning to active status.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello. I need my curtains cleaned.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Is the baby shower emergency resolved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. And uh, good news. The boys have hours and hours of research to do, phone calls for the case, so I thought, why not take this chance to show you around this little island we call home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It is not a critical juncture? I don’t want to be a shirker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, come on. A little shirking never hurt anyone. We’ll have a late lunch at Tavern on the Green and a … carriage ride around the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s – it’s a tradition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> This is why you have cell phones, huh?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I want to hear more about you. Diplomatic security sounds fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Ah, it’s like theater. Everyone pretends to be one thing when really, they’re another. And nobody cares about anything but the results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, bosses, right? What do they know? Uh … who do you report to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I’m sorry. My mamochka needs attention. It’s okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, listen, I know a thing or two about having a needy mamochka. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>VASILY</speaker><content>She is most excited I have met you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, well, I’m sure an autographed copy of my latest book could be arranged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Oh, amazing. She also requested a few souvenirs. We can go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anywhere you like.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rita, thank you for meeting with me so quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I like it. Although when I ran ops in strip clubs we were open for business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so, I’ve got two murders and all roads lead toward a Russian defector from the ‘80s, Anatoly Arkady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Doesn’t ring a bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, the FBI put him in WitPro under the name Frank Thomas and I was hoping you could put out a few quiet feelers, see if he’s working a new operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>You really did it.  You blew up your marriage and went down the LokSat rabbit hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I – um –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, yeah, nothing. It’s just that, um … well, you’ve been watching us, and you think that we’re broken up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>But you’re not.  Oh, I love a little sexual subterfuge. Oh, it makes things so much hotter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Castle is playing tour guide to a Russian diplomatic security officer. His name’s Vasiliy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Vasiliy Zhirov?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>He’s a clean North Russian Foreign Intelligence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So diplomatic security’s just a cover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what’s his real mission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Who knows. But if your husband gets in Vasiliy’s way he’s going to be collateral damage.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … unless your mamochka is a fan of rat droppings and dirty needles there’s really not much around here by way of souvenirs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Her tastes can be unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Actually, I lied about earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow – ow. Vasiliy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>You remember Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Red Heat, yes?  Compared to me his character is like weak, nonviolent child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Hey, little sunshine. Come on. Russian intelligence picked up chatter about an attack on Russian citizens in the United States. If that happens –  – dead Russians on American soil, it would be very bad for both our countries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we take that to Homeland Security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I cannot. Because believe the attackers are Russian. Do you understand now? I believe Anya Mishkin and this traitor are part of the conspiracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Poor Grigory got murdered because he stumbled into it.  I must break him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ANATOLY ARKADY</speaker><content>I’m not telling you squat, –  – comrade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Do you hear that, Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>ANATOLY</speaker><content>You couldn’t get me to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Even though he lived as an American all these decades, still he’s a Russian in his heart. But I will soften him up.  Like ice cream on a hot summer day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can’t let you do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Rick. You’re a nice guy. I like you. So please, don’t make me hurt you, too. Please.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>No there’s not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There is always another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Look, I wish I had more time to humor you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sixty seconds. Just give me sixty seconds. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Sixty seconds.  Fine. Show me what you got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Obviously this would –  – go a lot easier if you would tell him what he needs to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>ANATOLY</speaker><content>Okay. What he needs to know … is that you can both go screw yourselves!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Rick, I hate to be rude but so far I’m not impressed.  Fifty five seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay! Okay, okay. If – if Frank is the center of this conspiracy then he may have some clues on him as to where the attack is going to take place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Forty two seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a receipt. There’s a receipt for a … lamination kit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Which means what, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Very good. Forty two seconds. Forty one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, okay. All right. His map history has a search for uniform stores. Okay, call history – he called the same number three times last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Twenty nine seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>This is fun, no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a caterer. Why a catering company? What am I missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>For time. Only twenty four seconds left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on, seriously?  You’re right. Okay, lamination kit is – it’s uh … you’re making fake IDs. You’re making fake IDs to get someone into a catering company. Why? To slip into an event, but what event? You’re –  – the party at the Russian consulate. You’re making a fake ID to sneak someone into the party at the Russian consulate dressed as catering staff. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Brilliant! And with time to spare!  Actually, no. The party’s about to begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m gonna call Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Let’s hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have unis pick Frank up and have her meet us at the consulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Bye Frank.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They’re denying us entry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because this is considered Russian soil we can’t force our way in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Why hasn’t the Counsel General cancelled the party yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>How do you say, it is not good for business. If Oborin cancelled without clearable proof it looks weak in the eyes of his adversaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Politics wins over death threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>In Russia it is better to be killed than lose face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You need to get us in. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> It is invite only.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So invite us. We’ll be your plus four.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what’s the plan? We don’t even know who the target is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look for anyone out of place or acting unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we know that our attacker is dressed as one of the catering staff, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, not necessarily. They may have used the catering outfit to gain entry but now that they’re inside a ruthless traitor may try to blend in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes, yes, very true. But guys, most important I vouched for you. I have street cred to protect so please, stay cool, yeah?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>More champagne?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I’ll go get you some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sniper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>I – I think so.  I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somebody call an ambulance!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Sergei? Sergei!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bullet went through and through. Sergei’s in surgery right now, he’s expected to make a full recovery. Anything on the shooter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we found the sniper’s nest in the building across the street from the consulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Any luck with security video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Disabled, but we found a janitor’s uniform and the sniper’s weapon. It’s a Russian made Dragunov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did CSU pull prints or DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They’re trying, but I don’t think they’re going to find anything. Whoever pulled this off is a pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Which means IDing our shooter, who most likely killed Grigory when he found out about this whole assassination plot, is going to be damn near impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it only gets worse. The Russians are claiming that we created a distraction for their security team which allowed for the assassination attempt on their Counsel General.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait, hold up. You save the counsel’s ass and this is the thanks we get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Plus they are refusing any further cooperation with us on Grigory’s murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why would they do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Because we’re scared. It is easier to blame America for our troubles when the truth is, we’re fighting ourselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be an apology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It didn’t sound like one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>The attempt on Oborin’s life has shaken everyone in the Russian diplomatic community. No one knows who to trust and what little faith Oborin has in me he has now lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So now that you’re all out of friends you’ve come to us for help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Please, Captain. You told you only wanted to get the son of a b*tch behind this. Help me get justice. To Grigory, Anya, and Sergei.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Fine. But I have to bring someone else in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Get out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Long time no see.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Since that thing at the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>You mean the place with the guy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Nyet, not that guy. The other guy. The guy with the big, massive head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Oh, that guy. I remember. Things didn’t end well for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>They may not end well for you, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Like I don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>So right here, right now. Lay all your cards on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>The Russian consulate in New York has a leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>How bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Critical. Sensitive intelligence being sold at anonymously at auction. Two months ago I activated Anya Mishkin to identify the traitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I’m guessing the traitor got to her first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Anya’s last communique said she was close to unmaking him. But then she was killed in a car crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Your traitor silenced her. We need names. Who’s on your list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content> Sharing? And then there’s sharing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she’s from the State Department?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually that’s just a cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Cover for what? Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rita is many things, one of which is … your step-mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s been helping me take down LokSat. I’m – I wanted to tell you sooner, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess. You couldn’t because you needed to protect me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is getting really old, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know. Believe me. It is … old.  It’s very old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you’re absolutely right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. We –  – what about –  – what was I right about?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The report on the Dragunov sniper rifle said that the barrel twist rate was 320 millimeters but the newer version is 240, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes, it was changed in the ‘90s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then why would our sniper use an older model when the newer one is so much more powerful and accurate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>It – it must have been the only thing the assassin had access to. Only, who the hell leaves around a Russian sniper rifle from the 1980s lying around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>молния.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lightning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It’s an old KGB code name for weapons caches planted in NATO countries to support the agents in the field. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union many we abandoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>But someone in the field would know where they were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like Frank?  Except he’s all lawyered up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes, but I too know where these old caches are. We search these caches, we could find our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>You remind me of Jackson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I find that very hard to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>You have his eyes and that mischievous grin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Hmm. Yep, there it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How – is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Alive. In our business that’s all you can hope for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Has he ever, um … mentioned me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ouch. You couldn’t have lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>That doesn’t mean he’s not thinking of you. It’s just how he deals with having to stay away. He does it for your own safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am so sick of people pushing me away for my safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Specifically Beckett, I’m assuming?  Still a wee bit upset, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The anger flares up from time to time, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>She did it out of love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I know. And –  – at the end of the day, she’s worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I’m glad I met you, Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m glad I met you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content> But you didn’t. Remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, your secret is safe.  Am I going to see you or my dad again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>He’s so very proud of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, you’re going to want to see this. I was scrubbing traffic cam footage at the addresses of all the old Cold War caches in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, you have to see it to believe it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is from yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll show you. Wait for it …  Remember our Cold War spies, Anatoly and Anya?  This is her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>This is Anya Mishkin. Grigory’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But she died in the car crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nope. She’s alive and well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She must have taken the Dragunov from the gun cache. Now we know our assassin is.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you expect me to believe that you had no idea Anya was alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I swear that for all I know Anya was the leak in the Russian consulate all along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anya faked her own death to throw you off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Captain? That BOLO that I put on the stolen car that Anya got into paid off. Unis pulled her over on the LIE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do they have her in custody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bringing her in right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll question her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what was the end game, Anya? Money for selling secrets in a Cayman account so that you and Frank could sit on a beach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>ANYA MISHKIN</speaker><content>You have no idea what you are talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But the price for this fantasy getaway was steep: your son’s life. So who killed him? Was it Frank? Or did you do it yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>Everything I’ve done was in order to save him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Grigory found out the truth, didn’t he? And he threatened to expose you. That’s why you killed him. The thing I don’t understand is, why did you stick around for the assassination attempt at the consulate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>All I had left was vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did Oborin do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>I wasn’t aiming for Oborin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sergei?  You were aiming for your husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>And if you hadn’t interfered he would be dead now, as he should be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>I must say, Rick, your novels don’t do Beckett justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s just getting started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Whew.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>I am not the devil you think I am. I am not a traitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But your husband is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>Yes. Sergei is the one who’s been selling our trade secrets to economic competitors. I have proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why didn’t you tell Vasiliy? Was it love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>Not love. I held my tongue because my husband is very well connected.  Much more so than Vasiliy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Sadly Rick, this is all true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>If I had turned Sergei in he would have used his political muscle to bury me. I would have been the one on trial, not him. Laws mean nothing in Russia. All that matters is power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you fakes your death to protect yourself.  But Grigory became suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-3"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>He got onto the truth of what Sergei was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anya, are you saying that Sergei killed Grigory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>They’re not blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>Grigory’s biological father died before his birth and Sergei never truly bonded with Grigory. I followed Grigory to that apartment building. But I was too late. I saw Sergei running away and then I … found my poor boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why did you try to get revenge with a sniper rifle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>Because Sergei never left the consulate after the murder. That night was my best chance. My last chance! Soon he will go back to Russia and be out of my reach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I promise you I will do everything in my power to make sure that he is brought to justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>ANYA</speaker><content>My husband has full diplomatic immunity. You are powerless, just like I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t be too sure about that.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>You have no business here, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Oborin, are you aware that Sergei has been selling Russian trade secrets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Captain, this is a Russian matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he killed Grigory, just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>And it is a Russian matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>If you’ll excuse me, I have a plane to catch. I’ve been recalled to Moscow where I shall pay a small fine and begin my retirement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A fine? That’s his punishment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-8"><speaker>SERGEI</speaker><content>Would you do me a favor? Could you please tell my wife I said. “Алты́нного во́ра ве́шают, а полти́нного че́ствуют.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Small thieves get hanged, great ones go free. An old Russian proverb. Mr. Oborin, please. Revoke Sergei’s immunity. Have him stand trial for Grigory’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-11"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>It would set a very dangerous example. You see, Captain, Russian justice is very, very, complicated.  Oh, there is somebody who would like to say goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-12"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>You two look so unhappy. This breaks my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re, uh … leaving town? Same plane as Sergei?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-14"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>Yes. Nine hours to Moscow.  But plenty of time to work on our Heat and Ice collaboration, yes? In fact –  –I have an idea for the ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vasiliy, I don’t know if it’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-16"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It goes like this: Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook think the evil Russian has gotten away. What they don’t know is that Vladimir Ice has set in motion a plan to send the murderer to live out the rest of his miserable life at the lonely Russian outpost in Oymyakon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve heard of that town. That’s the coldest place on Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-18"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>It takes four days to warm the ground with burning fire before they can bury their dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that where Sergei is headed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-20"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>In Russia there are far worse places than prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-21"><speaker>OBORIN</speaker><content>Like I said, Russian justice is very complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-24"><speaker>VASILIY</speaker><content>This was fun, no?</content></utterance>
