<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>How many times do I have to say I’m sorry for shooting you in the ass? It was an accident! When are you going to let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>When I can sit on my ass without using a pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>THERAPIST</speaker><content>So, I take it there’s been little progress since our last session.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> No, not with his trust issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t have trust issues. He has jealousy issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, so for the last time, I am not jealous that you passed the sergeant’s exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tell that to the hole in my ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The one that he put there. Not the – I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>THERAPIST</speaker><content>Detectives, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>THERAPIST</speaker><content>You two depend on each other for your lives out there. But from what I am seeing, I’m sorry, but I am going to recommend that the two of you split up as partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, don’t do that, doc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s gotta be something else that we can try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>THERAPIST</speaker><content>Well –  – maybe you could use some sort of a buffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A buffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A buffer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey boys! How is it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Castle. Man, you can’t work this case with us, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh? Yeah, I’m not here about the case. Tomorrow is the first wedding anniversary for Beckett and me. And I was just hoping that you could distract her while I set up a surprise in her office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. Beckett doesn’t want you hanging around the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s just a little surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, Castle, nothing you do is little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, you’ll probably come in riding on an elephant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And then he takes her and the elephant up in a hot air balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, first anniversary’s paper, but otherwise that’s not a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute.  We’re not arguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s our buffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s our buffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh … let me guess. A little trouble in therapy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, we need … someone to follow us around and keep us from fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I would love to, guys, but my schedule is just so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll help you with your little surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Congratulations! Got yourself a buffer. Let’s go solve a case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello, Lanie. You’re looking lovely today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>I look lovely every day, Castle. And no, you cannot see the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why does everyone assume I’m here about the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s okay, Lanie. He’s with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what do we know about our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Name’s Scott McCoy. According to neighbors he’s an unemployed actor. Sure had the looks for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least the killer spared his face. His body, though … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nine separate entry wounds. Lividity puts the stabbing between midnight and 2AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nine entry wounds? That sounds like a crime of passion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Either that, or someone wanted to be really, really sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And we may have an ID of who that someone is. The weapon was wiped clean but CSU found prints on the knife block where the killer got it.  Waiting to hear if they’re in the system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right, I’ll follow up with CSU. Ryan, why don’t you grab a couple of unis and start a canvass –  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. I didn’t say pretty please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I didn’t say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You didn’t have to say anything. You just mope around like your dog died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, you’re supposed to be our buffer. Buff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Um … okay, guys. Role playing. Each of you take the other’s point of view. This is a time-tested method of conflict resolution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think that’s a dumbass idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You haven’t even tried it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, no. I was being Espo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. That’s good.  Even you have to admit, that was good Espo. Only you didn’t say yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yo. I just got a hit on those prints. Guy’s name is Anton Ford. In the system for felony assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Assault? Jeepers. Hope he’s not mean to me. I’m very sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. He’s being me.  Yeah, that’s pretty funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He did nail the walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah, his physicality’s pretty good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Cap. We got an update on the suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anton Ford.  Not only are his prints all over the crime scene, but he had history with our vic, Scott McCoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Scott’s credit card makes him a regular at a bar in Midtown. Now, we checked. The bounder said two nights ago Scott and Anton got into a full-on brawl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And that wasn’t the first time these two went at it. Last month, same bar, and in each instance it was over a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>So Anton was a lover and a fighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but apparently not very good at either. Both times our victim kicked his ass and went home with the girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means Anton could have been out for revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, unis are bringing him in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HAYLEY SHIPTON</speaker><content>Hey, how are my favorite crime solvers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! What brings you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, you said that I could come back and retrieve that stolen painting, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Uh, you know, you just have to go to the admin clerk on the second floor and fill out some paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thanks. Oh, and it’s so nice to see that Rick’s back working cases again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … yeah. Uh, what makes you say that he’s working cases?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Admin clerk, second floor. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He … is our buffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s your buffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Get the hell off me! Come on, get these cuffs off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And he’s our suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Get the hell off me! Get off!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Come on, take these cuffs off! See how tough you are. You think that badge makes you special? I ain’t do nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s our suspect? How does that mountain of a man get beaten up by our human sized Scott?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi. Hey, oh! I’m not here about the case. I’m just, uh – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A buffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They told me. Sort of.  So what is this? For therapy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Well, good luck on your interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, hey! Um, Beckett? Uh … about the interview. Would you mind doing it with me? Three’s a crowd in an interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure. Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We are go for Operation Booyah. Repeat, we are go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wow. Little surprise my wounded ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’ve got quite the record, Anton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>When provoked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is that what happened the other night at the bar? You were provoked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Wait, I’m – I’m in here for a bar fight? Come on, man! If you’re dragging people in here for that you’re going to have to arrest half the guys in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except half the guys in New York didn’t kill Scott McCoy.  And given all the witnesses who saw him beat you up –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- you have motive. Plus, your fingerprints are all over his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>My fingerprints are there because …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Because we were friends. Oh, Scott.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Castle. You done yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Almost!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>The fight was staged. Both of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why were they staged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>To help Scott pick up women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>You never heard of a wingman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A wingman who gets beat up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>It was just one of our tactics. See, if the target seemed like she was into macho guys, I’d hit on her first, real aggressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Scott would come to her rescue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>Yeah, by kicking my ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was a pickup artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>You could call it that. Scott was into rich, married women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would he target married women? What was his game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ANTON</speaker><content>I don’t know. He paid me not to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think you can describe any of these women?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I need more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. How’d it go with Anton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan will fill you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’d rather hear it from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, it’s that bad between the two of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, uh … we’re going to look into Anton’s alibi, but we don’t think he was our doer. Turns out he was actually helping our vic pick up rich married women in bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you think one of these ladies got ahold of a knife and went Psycho on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or one of their jealous husbands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, Anton remembers some of these women’s faces. So I – I think it would be a good idea if we got him with a sketch artist, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and we will do just that just as soon as you let me get into my office so I can make that call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now, may I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One more thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nice shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. What’d I miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s mine.  It’s uh … Australian money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, this is very sweet. This is …very you. But I don’t think that it would be a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I know that we’re on a time out right now. And … but tomorrow is our anniversary and I can’t bear the thought of spending it without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would love to. I really would. You have no idea how much, but I, um … I’m worried that it would be unfair.  Because no matter how great dinner would be, I would still need our time out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, I know. I’m not trying to put an end to the time out. I’m just saying, what if we could -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have a time out from our time out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. So what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would love to have dinner with you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>VIKRAM SINGH</speaker><content>Got a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I found something odd in our victim’s financials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Direct deposits from a shell corp. There’s a bunch of them. Five grand each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The last deposit was made three days ago. That’s the same day that Anton said he and Scott worked their bit on that woman in the bar.  You know what? Most of these payments line up with when Anton said Scott hired him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like Scott wasn’t picking up on married women for fun. It sounds like he was getting paid for it. But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Don’t know. I haven’t found much on the shell corp. But they do list an address. A pricey apartment in uptown. And when I called the business manager he said Scott rented it a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so our victim is an out of work actor getting mystery money from a mystery corporation and now there’s a mystery apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a lot of mysteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What the hell was this guy into?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whatever it was, it might have gotten him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Surprise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, this place is so much nicer than Scott’s other apartment. I bet he would have rather died here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but why did he need it? And what did it have to do with the shell corp that was paying him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>These drawers are all empty. Strange. It’s like he only wanted to make it look like he lived here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe this is where he was knocking boots with the married ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Sherlock Homeboy’s got a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what did you just say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I said, this place is really eerie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That is not what you just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, time out. Guys, in my official capacity as a buffer I’d like to recommend that we try something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No more role play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. This is something my second wife Gina and I used to do to avoid arguments. Instead of blurting out whatever was on our minds we would write it down to revisit it later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So nothing said in the heat of the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. See, we found with a little perspective what seemed so important to us at first was often quite trivial.  Sort of like our marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. I’m game if you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, I’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, well, well. Looks like this shell corporation was paying Scott to seduce rich, married women to get proof of their tryst. Most likely to blackmail them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s quite a racket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe a deadly one. Looks like someone did not enjoy getting screwed. Out of their money, that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s no SD card in here. It’s WiFi enabled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So’s this printer. And the last job’s still in the memory. Let’s see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s Scott in bed with a woman but you can’t see her face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But look what you can see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think that’s her elbow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not that. The tattoo in the small of her back. It’s a dragonfly. We can use that to ID her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How? Are we going to do a butt line up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As fun as that does sound, we might not need to. Anton’s sketches just came in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where are you with matching Vulcan Simmons’s heroin to current dealers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Nowhere. It’s going to take a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Which is why I think you going out to dinner with Castle is a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know. But I miss him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content> I know. But if you let him in and he figures out what we’re doing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know the risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, we’ve got something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Using a sketch that Anton provided, we were able to ID one of Scott’s recent targets.  Annika Smythe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, the socialite wife of that hedge fund guy? Isn’t she in the tabloids all the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which is how we recognized her. And how we know she’s going through a messy divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know Annika. Now meet Nancy Underwood and Claire Stevens. Both loaded and going through divorces. There’s a picture of all three of them at a fundraiser last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So they know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, more than that. They hang out together. Matter of fact, according to Annika’s Instagram they’re going to a spa later. And you know what this means, Beckett. It’s a murderous First Wives’ Club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think they did this together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not? Scott blackmails the ladies. When they refuse to pay, he shows the photos to their husbands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who promptly divorce them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So all three women band together and kill Scott for ruining their marriages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is the perfect theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except it’s completely unsubstantiated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is … true. But we could just have them in for questioning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Based on what? The plot of The First Wives’ Club movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No. Of course not. There was no murder in that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, whatever we do we’ve got to do it fast. Before they all scatter. Annika’s been posting about how she’s going to be flying to Paris tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’ve got to get some hard evidence tying our vic to one of these women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. You said that they were going to spend the day at the spa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Where all body art will be on full display. If one of them has that tattoo –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we can bring them in. I just need a partner to go with me into the women’s locker room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A female partner, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So I got the paperwork for the painting all figured out. I just need your signature and then I’ll be on my …  – what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You look a little stressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about a day at the spa courtesy of the NYPD?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>Did you see how it made the news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CLAIRE</speaker><content>Yeah, I bet we’re not the only ones celebrating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>Come on, guys. We’re here to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>The eagles have landed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So which one do you think is our tattooed lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh … there’s only one way to be sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> I think that you and your husband are just in a rut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s just, we’ve gotten comfortable. And I don’t want comfortable. I want edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ooh, then you’ve got to spice things up a little, sweetie. Get yourself a tattoo. Men love ink. Makes them think you’re naughty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh, come on. That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>Wrong. Tattoos are hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>We should introduce you to Ivan. He’s a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A genius? I mean, that sounds like a little bit of a stretch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>Judge for yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CLAIRE</speaker><content>Wait. Don’t I know you from somewhere?  Yeah, you’re married to that writer, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I’m sure you’re confusing me with somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CLAIRE</speaker><content>No. She’s a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>What’s going on? And don’t pretend you’re just here for a steam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Fine. We’re here to ask you a few questions about your relationships with Scott McCoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>Call our lawyers, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will. Right after I drag you down to the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You could post a photo on Instagram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>ANNIKA</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CLAIRE</speaker><content>If you had anything on us you wouldn’t be down here trying to see us naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, we’ve got something. Or … rather, one of you does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And it’s tattooed on one of your butts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh. We got a winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>She’s running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In the towel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop! Stop her!  No, no, don’t stop us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh!  Found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well –  – time to get dressed. Spa day’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Before we go, can you please give me the number of your tattoo artist? You’re right, the guy’s a bloody genius.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And when you ID’ed the tattoo did you pull the towel off or did it just … fall off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, actually, Kate pulled the towel off, but I’m not quite sure how this is relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You are pathetic, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Somebody’s got to write this report.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wow. So, Hayley, it must have been pretty hard for you guys to chase her. Because you and Beckett were both wearing towels, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. Okay, here you go. This is your voucher. Just take that up to evidence and that painting is yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>All right. I’ll see you perverts later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yes you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan was trying to get details on your wardrobe malfunction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Me? You were the one asking if Beckett was wearing a towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought Castle was helping you resolve this conflict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Then he went home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’ve got a suspect to interview. And the two of you need to figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What Castle said. Writing it down. Trust me, I’ve got a lot to write.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I hope my pen doesn’t run out of ink.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>Yes, I slept with Scott. And yes, he took photos. Obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he used them to blackmail you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>Blackmail? Where are you getting that from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, how else did your now ex-husband end up with these photos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>Because my ex hired Scott to sleep with me. The same thing happened with all of us. Annika and Claire. You see, our husbands wanted to trade us in for younger trophy wives without having to pay through the nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, because you guys had infidelity clauses in our prenups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>Yeah. My night with Scott cost me twelve mil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, you do realize you just gave me a motive for Scott’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His neighbor ID’ed you. He said that you were standing outside the building at midnight, just before Scott was killed. So do you want to tell me what really happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>The night that we had together? Was something I hadn’t experienced in a long time. And to find out that I was just another paycheck … so I went to confront him. But I didn’t even get to yell at him. He apologized to me before I could even get a word out. Said he was a horrible human being for what he’d done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why did he have this sudden change of heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>He said that he had learned something working his last job. Something upsetting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So did he tell you what his last job was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>NANCY</speaker><content>It was another seduction but he didn’t say who. Just that he had screwed over a good person and he wanted to make it right. Or die trying.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So Nancy’s car service driver confirms that our vic was alive when Nancy left. He helped her into the car at 12:15, then the driver took Nancy all the way out to Greenwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. So she’s not our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe Scott’s murder has something to do with that last job he was working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s see who Scott screwed over and what he was doing to make it right the night that he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I think I know where to start looking. Nancy’s husband and all his friends all used the same lawyer to bust up their prenups. Some hotshot named Lindsey Trent. The Ledger just did a piece on her. The divorce attorney to the rich and shameless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, if she was the one that was hiring Scott she would know what his last job was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, yeah. But there’s no way she’s going to talk to us without a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which we won’t get unless we have something concrete to tie her to all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I’ll call the writing DA in the morning. We’ll brainstorm on how to get a warrant. I’ll see you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> We need to go at this another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, maybe the way to find out about Scott’s last seduction is with a seduction of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I have no idea what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, let me get this straight. You want me to see a divorce attorney. Tomorrow. On my wedding anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>To pose as a client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>No, no, no. I don’t think so, Richard. Does Katherine know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, no. No. And she’s not going to. Best to give her … uh… plausible deniability in case this thing goes sideways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Although I do love a good sting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>What would you need him to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know how lawyers keep a log of all the hours they spend on each client?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sure. They keep track of their time down to the minute.  And of every expense incurred on each case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just like hiring Scott.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if I get a look at the last few days in this logbook of Lindsey’s we can figure out Scott’s last job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So … are you in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>LINDSEY TRENT</speaker><content>Richard Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Lindsey Trent. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Well, divorce is stressful enough. Finding a lawyer shouldn’t be. Now, let’s go back to my office and we’ll see how I can help you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>How was your drive? Did you hit much traffic on the way in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, no. Surprisingly it was not bad at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Figures Castle would own a pair of livestreaming glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Actually, Beckett gave them to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what are you guys doing in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett! How’s that warrant coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, you know, unfortunately the DA said that we don’t have enough proof to um … what are you watching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hm? Oh. It’s … it’s porn.  You don’t want to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So have you been here long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>These are our new offices, but we did recently –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that the lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … that is the livestream from Castle’s glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you guys sent Castle on a surveillance mission after I told you he was not to work anymore NYPD cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We didn’t think you should know. We were trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By sending my husband to the city’s top divorce attorney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Happy anniversary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you guys have any idea how risky this is? This could blow the entire case. Our involvement in and knowledge of this operation is over.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Tell me, what happened with you and uh, Kate Beckett, right? The NYPD detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, uh, she’s a captain, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Oh, she moved up the ladder quickly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, she’s very good at what she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>And that is the root of your problem, isn’t it? She’s so focused on work she doesn’t have anything left for you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Don’t look so surprised. It’s a story I’ve heard all too often.  But like the stories you write, Mr. Castle, you get to choose how this ends. So, tell me. Are you set on divorce? Or is there still hope?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, um … that’s a rather unusual question for a divorce attorney to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Well, it’s not like I need the business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Yes, I’m sure you’re um … sure you’re very busy.  Could I – could I get some water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>That’s okay.  Tiffany, can I get some towels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Tiff?  Idiot.  Um, I’m going to go to the restroom, just get some paper towels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>This is Lindsey.  Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Thanks for the heads up.  That was a friend of mine from the DA’s office. And it, uh, it turns out someone is trying to get a warrant for my client log and oh yeah, it’s your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Really? That’s a crazy coincidence.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Seriously, this is just a misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not an idiot, but obviously you must be. There is no way you could fool me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, you have … strong fingers.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Richard Keller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>According to Lindsey’s log book, he is the last billed for Scott’s services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is he connected to Keller Toys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s the president of the entire Keller empire. Toys, video games, books, educational videos, you name it. It’s a multi-billion dollar company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And a brand synonymous with family values, which is ironic, since he’s a renowned playboy already on wife number three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You say that like it’s a bad thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, and here’s another fact. Keller’s last divorce featured a prenup that was nullified by … you guessed it, his wife’s infidelity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So George Keller has used Scott’s services before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And if Scott was seducing the current Mrs. Keller when he had his big change of heart -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He might have turned on George and threatened to expose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which would have damaged the company’s wholesome reputation, so Keller killed Scott to keep him quiet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>GEORGE KELLER</speaker><content>Scott McCoy. Sorry, I have no idea who that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, that’s funny. Because your second wife did. She recognized him immediately after I showed her this picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I guess it’s hard to forget somebody who cost you millions in a broken prenup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>KELLER</speaker><content>It’s not my fault she slept around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You paid the guy that she slept with and you hired him again to help you dump your current trophy wife at a discounted price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>KELLER</speaker><content>You don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Not another word, George.  You need to release my client right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Any evidence that you think that you have has been obtained illegally making anything that Mr. Keller said inadmissible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Oh, well you tell me, Captain. First you send your husband to steal my records and now your detective is questioning my client without cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your client hired our victim to sleep with his wife. In fact, our victim slept with four of your client’s wives in order to blow up their prenups. That’s a fact that I’m sure would be interesting to the New York Bar Association.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Okay, let’s not get sidetracked here. The simple fact is, you’re investigating a murder which my client has nothing to do with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we should just take your word for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Of course not. I will provide my client’s whereabouts the night Mr. McCoy was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>KELLER</speaker><content>And you guys need to get your facts straight. I’m not looking to divorce my wife. We’re renewing our vows next weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know we’re going to look into that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>KELLER</speaker><content>Oh, please do. In fact –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>George.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>KELLER</speaker><content>- I’ll even send you the insurance papers for the two million dollar ring I’m giving her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Keller’s telling the truth. He and his third wife are renewing their vows next weekend in the Caribbean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And that two million dollar rock is legit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was just about to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, really? I thought you were about to tell her how you were still struggling to verify Keller’s alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I’m struggling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re struggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, come on.  Guys! All right. Tell me about Keller’s alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m still trying to confirm that he was at his office when Scott was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, until we can verify that then he is still a suspect. And my gut says he is hiding something. So find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And your gut is never wrong. You know, I know some people in Keller’s circle. I could put my feelers out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … yeah. Thanks, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My pleasure.  How are things between the boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not good, actually. I’m kind of worried about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, they’ll work it out. They’ve been through way too much together to give up on what they have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a wise man, Castle. With a big heart. You’re rather good looking, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Might want to pace yourself with the flattery. You have a whole dinner to get through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Come on, Javi. Just say it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Trust me, you don’t want to hear what I really think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, bring it on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right. You’re a whiny, insecure, jealous little baby who shot me in the ass on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you are an arrogant, manscaped Neanderthal and it wasn’t on purpose. Next time it’s gonna be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s it. I want a new partner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, we can’t leave them like this, can we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’ll talk to Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll see if I can calm Ryan down. Raincheck on dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How did it all go so wrong? I mean, one day we’re a team. Simpatico. Finishing each other’s sentences. And then …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You shot him in the ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was an accident, Jav.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, was it? You sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. And deep down in your heart you are too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. Once the trust is gone it’s really hard to get it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. That’s not true. A strong relationship can survive anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No relationship can survive secrets. Or lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, you need to tell Esposito the truth. That you were hurt and jealous that he passed the test and you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Forget that. He – he rubbed it in my face, remember? Sergeant Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You need to apologize.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hell no. I am not apologizing to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Even before he shot me he couldn’t believe that I passed and he didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have to let it go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have to let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, it’s my friend who knows George Keller.  Hey Francis.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, that’s good. That’s all I need. Thank you. ‘Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turns out, George is involved in a power struggle over the Keller empire. With present CEO Penelope Keller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His mother, right? She founded the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, she did. Now, she has an advantage over George because Keller is a family brand. She has an impeccable reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait. You don’t think –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yes I do. George hired Scott to honeypot his own mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>PENELOPE KELLER</speaker><content>I hadn’t been with anyone since my husband passed last year. It was time and it was … lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you had no idea that your son hired Scott to smear your reputation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>PENELOPE</speaker><content>None.  I wish I could tell you I was more surprised when you told me. But family values have never been George’s strong suit. Which is actually what our feud is about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean by that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>PENELOPE</speaker><content>George wants to shut down all the manufacturing operations in this country and send them overseas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To save money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>PENELOPE</speaker><content>But thousands of workers would lose their jobs. I consider those people my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you ever mention any of this to Scott?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>PENELOPE</speaker><content>Yes. Among other things he did well, Scott was a wonderful listener. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it seems like he had a crisis of confidence that night. Something happened that made him want to change his ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>PENELOPE</speaker><content>Oh dear. You know, there was something odd. The next day I couldn’t find my card key to the office. I just assumed I’d misplaced it. Is it possible Scott took it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So according to Keller’s security chief, Penelope’s card key was used to enter the building at 11:30PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Scott did go there the night that he was killed. And I am betting you it was to meet with George.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But instead of bringing X-rated photos of mom, Scott threatened to expose George’s illegal smear campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Keller followed Scott home and then silenced him. It’s a solid theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Only it doesn’t match the facts. In order to verify Keller’s alibi Vikram and I scrubbed security footage from his office. It shows Scott arriving at 11:30. But then Scott left ten minutes later. George Keller stayed until 3AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>3AM. That’s an hour after Scott was killed. Keller’s alibi holds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but you know, guys, just because Keller didn’t follow Scott home doesn’t mean he’s not involved somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if he enlisted someone to kill Scott it would have to have been after Scott showed up and threatened him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, Espo, you did manage to get security cam footage from Keller’s office. You think you could get some phone records, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BRAD WASHINGTON</speaker><content>Lindsey Trent? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, sir. It seems like she was Mr. Keller’s go-to person for all manner of criminal activities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BRAD</speaker><content>If Lindsey was operating an entrapment scam for any of her clients it was without the firm’s knowledge or approval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well then, I’m sure you’ll be happy to help us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BRAD</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan, why don’t you go with this guy and grab copies of Lindsey’s files and phone records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, Sarge. You want me to get you a cup of coffee, too, while I’m at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ooh, I am so glad this is almost over.  And put this damn pad away.  All right? It doesn’t matter anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BRAD</speaker><content>So, which one of you gets the house?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>You again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Here to harass me some more, Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Actually, I’m here to take you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>If this is your latest attempt to get access to my client log -  – won’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You don’t get it, do you? You’re under arrest for the murder of Scott McCoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Why would I possibly do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because Scott was about to blow the whistle on George Keller and if your client’s going down for criminal conspiracy, well, you would, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Okay, this is crazy. You have nothing on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you can tell that to the judge who signed the search warrant for your apartment. CSU’s going through it right now. Now, if you’re innocent that won’t be a problem. But if you stab a guy nine times you’re bound to get some blood on you somewhere. You probably threw the clothes out, but what about the shoes? Did you get rid of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or did you just try to wipe them off? Because blood residue can be one stubborn son of a b*tch. Now, like I said, I’m taking you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lindsey, calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Just shut up and let me think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now listen to me. You’re a brilliant lawyer. You might still beat this. But if you pull that trigger you’re going to go away forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>LINDSEY</speaker><content>Stay back. Just stay away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Javi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Kevin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Kevin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your notepad stopped the bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> How about that? Isn’t that why you put it there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You saved my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Would you help me up before the psycho b*tch gets away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.  Come on.</content></utterance>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stop! NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t move or I’ll shoot your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’ll do it, too. Trust me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m still surprised that you jumped in front of a bullet for this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Me too. I mean, normally his slow as molasses ass is never that fast, but he was just, like, like –  – phew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, what about George Keller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We picked him up at the airport. Lindsey confessed that uh, they were in on it together. And he was trying to leave the country on a private jet, so there you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, looks like he’s going to have to postpone renewing his vows for another, what? Thirty to life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, guys, I have to get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … unless you still want me to put in those new partner requests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … nah. Not tonight. I’m going to need somebody eventually when this guy gets bumped up to Sergeant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, that’s not going to happen anytime soon. I’m number two seventy nine on the list of three hundred, so … we’re going to be stuck together for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I like the sound of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> If that’s cool with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, yeah.  If it’s cool with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is it cool with me? Bro, you took a bullet for me. You’ve got a wife, a pregnant wife at home. And you got a little – a little girl who depends on you and yet you still … come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m just going to give you guys a moment. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Want to come over? Watch some UFC? Jenny made tofu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I like the sound of that. The UFC part.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="44-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, I know. No, this is just a … time out from the time out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. So … time in?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When you were in that divorce lawyer’s office I was watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why Captain Beckett, I had no idea. I feel so violated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I know you were just playing a role, but … when she asked you if there was any hope for us and you didn’t say anything I was …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate. I have never given up hope. Not since the day we met. And that will never change until you tell me it should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Then don’t change.  Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
