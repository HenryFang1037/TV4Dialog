<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>I made you a coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>So it wasn’t a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. You definitely weren’t dreaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well you were right. I had no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you liked it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Even the part where –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Especially that part. I loved that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Good. Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So –  you’re on board with this, right? It’s not some oh-I-quit-my-job-I-almost-died-now-I’m-in-crisis thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No – … not for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay. Me neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But I um – I did just quit my job. And I do have the day off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, I do … too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what would you like to do today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, I don’t know. We could read.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We could watch TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. We could get something to eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We could do that, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Richard! I’m home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said she was in the Hamptons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was in the Hamptons! She’s not supposed to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Get in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I am not going into the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Get in the closet! Go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just … making the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I wanted to talk to you about your daughter’s many fine qualities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do we have to do this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And to remind you that our Alexis is a paragon of grace and good sense and maturity, although where she got those qualities I do not know. However –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right – I would just be so much more comfortable having this conversation with my clothes on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh! Well … yes. We’ll meet you in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We? Alexis is here, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>How about some tea? Tea can be very soothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> No. No tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis, are you hung over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, the graduation festivities and Alexis called me from the party, I drove into town and picked her up. So please don’t get angry, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well why didn’t you call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I tried. You didn’t pick up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Right. Then … that’s on me. That’s my bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Alexis … as your father I have to say that I am –  – deeply disappointed in you. And yet oddly proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>My head is pounding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh honey. I’ll get you a couple of aspirin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no!  No aspirin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What do you mean? Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s her first hangover. I mean, this is a milestone. A rite of passage. Don’t you want to experience it in its fullness, untrammeled by the relief of over the counter pain relievers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Okay. Aspirin it is, sweetheart. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>So, any progress on Beckett’s shooter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>We searched the rental car. We still have no idea where he was going or even what his real name was. But we did find out what he stole from Captain Montgomery’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Montgomery’s wedding album. Why did Maddox want this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m guess he wanted this photograph.  It’s possible he was after whoever was in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Have you been able to track it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well I’ve got Evelyn Montgomery bringing the negatives in, but truth is I’m a one man band here. I could use a few more investigators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well you can take it up with the Vice President  I’ve already lost half my people to his security detail and I’m about to lose the rest to traffic control, so for right now, you’re on your own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>COLE MADDOX</speaker><content>You’re putting yourself through this for nothing, Mr. Smith. We both know how it will end. Don’t make me take this to the next level. Tell me where the file is.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you here to apologize for hiding me in your closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, let me explain. When I heard her voice I reacted by instinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, like the instinct of a sophomore in high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Look. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. You’re embarrassed about being seen with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now that is not true. Look, I - this – I – look – okay, this is all just still very new to me. And call me selfish, but I want to keep what we have together to ourselves a bit longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Still, it wasn’t your finest hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.  But maybe I can make it up to you … somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I suppose since we know your mom’s not going to be barging in we could go for round two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well technically it would be round four, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s stalking us. She knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Beckett, it’s Ryan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hide. Quick. In the closet over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m not getting in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? I hid in your closet. Why can’t you hide in mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why should I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Beckett, is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine.  Okay, maybe I’m not ready for everyone to know yet.  Right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, how’s he going to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re here! Just like I was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, the difference being I have my pants on.  Or – or are you embarrassed to be seen with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Just act normal. If that’s even possible for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Castle. … what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I was just walking by the neighbor … hood. I only live 20 …  What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I need to talk to you about the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Ryan? Uh, no, Ryan. I’ve resigned. I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look, I hope this isn’t because of Gates. Or… because of what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! No, look. I get it. You were just trying to keep us safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I still am. And this guy that threw you off the roof, he’s still out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey … Ryan…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I know what this case has done to you. I’m not asking you to jump back in. I just want to show you something. That’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We found a copy of the photo Maddox took from the wedding album. You’re familiar with the guys that Roy ran with back in the day. Is he one of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve never seen him before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have.  This is the man I told you about. The one who’s been keeping you safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s older now, but it’s definitely him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What – what are we talking about here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever information Montgomery gave to him, he’s been using it to protect you. But now they’ve sent Maddox to hunt him down and get it back. If we don’t get to him before Maddox does you’ll never be safe again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy Maddox is looking for, he’s the key. We find him we find Montgomery’s file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which could lead to who’s behind this whole thing. Including your mother’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>In all the times you talked, he never gave you a name? Not even a fake one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where he worked? Where he lived?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, nothing like that. He um, he called my cell phone. Two nights ago. But from a blocked number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll run your phone records, see if I can trace the number that he called from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This was supposed to be over. I can’t go back again. Not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well now we don’t have a choice. If Maddox gets to him before we do –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> But I don’t know how to do this. I’m not even a cop anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll tell you exactly what we do.  We figure out who this is. We’ve done it before, and with less to go on. And when we do? We lay all of this to rest and we go back to where we were. This is what you’re great at. And I’m not so bad myself.  So, what do we know? We know this guy is about 60. He’s a long time New Yorker. Uh … friends with Montgomery, so he might have connections to law enforcement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He um … he seems prominent. Wealthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right. And he has been that way ever since this photo was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at his wrist.  That’s a Nautilus 3800. It was $10 grand when it came out in 1981. It – that’s the year Montgomery was married. May of 1981. How many of these watches could have possibly been sold in five months?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>STAFF SERGEANT CASS</speaker><content>Javi, I can’t do what you’re asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I took a bullet for you, Cass. You forget that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASS</speaker><content>I can’t tap into the DOD database without authorization. I’ll lose everything, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Only if you get caught.  And you won’t.  I bought this from a liquidator. Cash. Soon as we’re done, I’ll wipe the drive, ditch the box. It’ll never come back to you. He’s former army. Special forces Delta, I don’t know.  This guy shot a friend of mine. Almost killed her. He’s gonna keep coming unless he’s stopped. I need to ID him. You need to help me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Yes. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Watch company says that 17 of the 3800s were sold in New York in 1981 between January and May.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did they give you names of any of these clients?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But 9 of the 17 watches were given as gifts to a legal team at the law firm P.P.C after they won a civil suit against big tobacco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Winning a tobacco lawsuit would get a lot of publicity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With any luck we’ll ID this guy before Ryan even traces that call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean you can’t trace the call? Why the hell not?  Look, I’m on the clock here. I need to know who made that call, now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Just put Officer Hoban on. He’s the guy I usually deal with over there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so this is the P.P.C legal team that won the suit but … I … don’t see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it was a 9 man team. There’s only 8 here. He must be the missing lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or he’s not a lawyer at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or he is a lawyer but … he operates behind the scenes. He would be um … of council. Like Michael Clayton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, this photo is 30 years old. We have no idea if this guy still works at this law firm or if he ever worked there at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Bad news. The number the guy called Castle from came from a burner phone and it’s out of service. Whoever this guy is he covered his tracks. Look, we’ve put out alerts for Maddox, we’ve circulated his photo all over the state. Someone will spot him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well we can’t wait for that. Did you get anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, there is one thing but it’s a longshot. The guy used voiceover internet instead of normal cell service, but he made a call in a bad signal area that got rerouted through a wireless network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if it’s a network it’ll have an IP address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, and we traced it … uh …  it’s not even in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The call went through a wireless network that’s registered to a Magellan Yacht Club in Westport Connecticut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks, Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He must be a member at this club. Maybe there’s a picture of him posted somewhere on the site?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, look.  On the up council attorney list.  Now look at the board of directors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Michael Smith. That’s him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maddox found him first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The file. Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s still alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Smith, can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Sir, I’m asking you to step away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>The file.  She’s not safe. 86 …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Strap him down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>86. What does that mean? I don’t know what that means!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>86 –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>86. I don’t understand –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Sir, we have to get him to the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>86 M –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If Smith makes it Ryan’s going to put him under police guard. Make sure that Maddox doesn’t come back and finish off the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smith just gave me a message. He said ‘86’. It must be a clue to where the file is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know where the file is. It’s right there. It’s burned to a crisp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Smith is too smart to only keep one copy and in his own apartment. He’s too careful for that, he’s – it’s a code. The answer’s here somewhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the answer’s got to be here.  It’s somewhere here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, there’s nothing left to find. 86 could mean anything. You’re just grasping at straws!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, I’m grasping at straws! ‘cause if that file is gone, that means they’re coming after you and there’s absolutely nothing I can do. So yes, if there is a straw, I’m grasping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we’re not even supposed to be here. When uniforms come here they’re going to arrest us for breaking and entering. We’re running out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh – Smith owns property in lower Manhattan. This one, 86 Markwell Street. That’s what Smith said. He said 86 and then ‘maa’, like something that started with M. This building? This is where the file is.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, so … the building has 10 stories. How hard can it be to find a file, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait. He would have hid it in a place that was safe from the demolition crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, which suggests that Mr. Smith now only owns this building, but he knows it inside and out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.  Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> For what? We haven’t found it yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s just that I know I would never have gotten this far if it wasn’t for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, we’re going to get this done.  You and me.  And we’re going to start by ruling out all the interior rooms. Smith wouldn’t risk hiding it there with all this sheet rock getting torn down. Ceilings are no good either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.  Michael Smith, 523. He didn’t just own the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He had an office on the 5th floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>Well that’s some helpful information. Turn around, hands behind your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>You just don’t know when to quit, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you convinced Smith to tell you where the file was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>He told me it was hidden in a floor safe, but he didn’t tell me exactly where. Good thing you guys cleared that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t kill him in case you couldn’t find the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>And once I do I’m finally going to settle our account.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>See you soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, we’ve got a minute, maybe two, to get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, how tight are your zipties? Can you move your hands at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, just barely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have anything sharp in your pockets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like a knife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nail clippers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. – who carries nail clippers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s a fob. It’s a remote.  There’s – there’s a drywall screw!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s not going to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, I beg to differ. All I have to do is –  – grab the ziptie and saw through.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am barely making a dent in this thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I hear footsteps coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Man, if we got murdered right now I’d feel so ripped off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least … at least we had last night. We should have done that 4 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Done what 4 years ago?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maddox’s real name is Cedric Marx. Once he finished his tour he got a job at a place called Arantas Solutions, a kind of black ops military contractor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did all that lead you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, once I got his name I put a BOLO out on his car. Uniforms spotted it outside this building. When I came to check on it that’s when I saw your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, wait, Espo. 523’s around the corner. You got an extra piece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Nice. What about for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, you mean an extra extra piece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Wow.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move. Don’t even breathe. Reach for it and I’ll blow your head off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>MADDOX</speaker><content>Okay, Detective. You’re in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now slowly reach down and hand me the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> He’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks for the warning, Smith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He knew that Maddox would show up here first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The file.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So let me see if I understand. As luck would have it, you three were in the neighborhood, taking a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, many people consider that the best form of exercise. It’s low impact, it has –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then you heard an explosion and as concerned private citizens you rushed inside to check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Is that how you remember it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain Gates, I can personally vouch for that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I am not interested, Mr. Castle, as you specialize in fiction. Let’s say that you happened to be in the area. How do you explain the fact that Maddox, the killer we’re searching for and the man who shot you last year, is the one lying there dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bad karma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do you know anything about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just that it appears the safe was rigged to blow when Maddox opened it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And what was in that safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hard to say. Papers of some kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And I don’t suppose you know what was in those papers and why Maddox was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like I said, we were just walking by.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We were so close. That file would have told us who’s at the center of this and who killed my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well at least Maddox won’t be coming after you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’ll just send somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well unless whoever’s behind all this doesn’t know the file’s been destroyed. Maybe he thinks it’s still in play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t bet on that, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You want to put that thing away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well if it isn’t Judas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, pal. You want to give it a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys, c’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I came to bring you this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paper from the safe?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Names. Places. Dates. Anything that tells us what was in these files and why someone is so desperate to keep it hidden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> 5 hours. And all I’ve got is something the size of a playing card, and not only that, it’s blank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah well, I’ve got ‘ending balance’ here. I think it’s some kind of bank statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not just a bank statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh… this is part of a money order made out to cash. That could be a payoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And whoever it went to is probably our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that would make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, in what way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, all of this started when Montgomery and his cop buddies started kidnapping mobsters for ransom money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And we know someone found out and demanded a cut of that money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And whoever that is, there’s something in this file that he does not want to get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. This – this has numbers on it. And it’s machine printed, it’s an 8 digit string, so it’s not a phone number. Wait a minute –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh – that’s the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is the back of that money order. And these digits – 08672241 - that’s the account it was deposited in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If we figure out whose account that is, that should give us a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I think I know a way. Do you remember when we were checking banking accounts for that dirty bomb investigation? We used the federal banking database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I still remember the password.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m not even sure they track accounts going back this far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoever owns that account is the person who killed my mom. Run it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The account was closed 19 years ago. Belonged to a guy named William H. Bracken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean Senator William Bracken?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to the bio on his campaign website, Senator Bracken was Assistant District Attorney for New York from ’88 til ’92.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m fine, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bracken’s timeline fits. That was when Montgomery was kidnapping gangsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bracken must’ve heard about what they were doing through the grapevine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he realized that he couldn’t charge mobsters because they wouldn’t testify and then the cops would walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So instead he decided to get in on the action. If they were collecting ransom from mob guys he wanted a taste in the form of cash money orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. But as his political star rose from Congressman to Senator, he realized he had to make sure this scandal never came to light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then people started dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ryan. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well this would explain why he’s coming after you right now. Word is, Bracken’s being groomed to run for President.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s trying to clean house and you’re next. We need to take him down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>How? All we have are a bunch of numbers that are meaningless to anyone but us. We have absolutely no hard evidence against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah… I may have the next best thing. I just got word that Michael Smith is out of surgery and he’s awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smith is the key. He can connect all this to Bracken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle and I are going to go talk to him. You guys see if you can find a link between Maddox and Bracken.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan called you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Yeah, he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>You’re alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Join the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>What about the other file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maddox opened the safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We put enough of it together to know that Bracken took dirty money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>Close the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>The irony is that he used that money to finance his first Congressional campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll need proof of that. Along with anything else that he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>There is no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well there’s you. You can testify.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>That will never happen.  You see, Roy Montgomery once did me a favor. So I kept that file and protected you, at great personal cost. Because I owed Roy. But I don’t owe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … you’re just going to let him get away with murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>You don’t understand, Detective. He’s protected. Untouchable. You’re just going to end up dead. And so am I. Now as it is, my best bet is to just … disappear. I suggest that you do the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know that you know too much. Just like Roy and my mom did. They found you once, they will find you again. And your only bet is to work with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>I’m tired. You need to go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, thank you. You just let me know if you figure anything out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, that was Ryan. He said they found no concrete connection between Maddox and Bracken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and we won’t find one. He’s too careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smith is the connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but he won’t cooperate, Castle. He’s already made that clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is his only play. He’s smart enough to know that, he just needs a little bit of encouragement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, wait! Why aren’t you with Smith?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Dispatch called and told me to stand down.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>Call it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, wait. What happened?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I finally figured out who he is, the guy who killed my mom and there’s nothing I can do about it.  Did Ryan talk to you? Did he check those security cameras around Smith’s room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The cameras were disabled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. So they’re coming for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan’s got 2 teams stationed outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about tomorrow? And the day after that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me take you someplace, Kate. Someplace you’ll be safe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah. It’s Detective Kevin Ryan, badge number 42344. Can I get a 20 on Senator Bracken?  He’s hosting a fundraiser at the Windmark Hotel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>When I was 14 I got to be friends with this boy in the neighborhood. Lamarr Dochs. Sweet kid. I used to help him with his homework after school. Well one day he doesn’t come to school. So I went by his apartment and the door was open. I walked in and I found Lamarr lying on his mattress, dead. His little sister the same way, his mother who’s in the bedroom, she had hanged herself. Now, she left a note; she lost her job, she was being evicted, and I thought, how could a woman be so desperate, so without hope that she could crush up pills, put them in hot chocolate, and give them to her kids? And that was the moment. The moment I knew I wanted to help make people’s lives better. And I have. I strengthened the safety net to protect kids like Lamarr. I created jobs in those neighborhoods. I’ve done great things. Just as you’ve done great things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Who do you think you’re talking to? How can you justify yourself to me? My mother was stabbed, in an alley, because of you. She bled to death, alone, in a pile of garbage, so save me your campaign speeches about the great things!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>You sound a bit delusional, you know? But then again, who are you? You’re a disgraced cop obsessed with her mother’s murder. And who am I? I’m a decent man looking out for the little guy. That’s who the public sees. And every time they elect me, I’m humbled. I strive harder to live up to that ideal, I want to be that man. And I won’t let you or anyone else get in my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t think you’re in a position to threaten, Senator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>See, here’s what you don’t understand. It’s not who has the gun. It’s who has the power. Do you really think that’s you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Smith had another copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>0862241, that’s the number of the bank account where you deposited the money orders. So you’re right. It is about who holds the power. Now I could release that file and destroy you, but what would that mean for my life expectancy? So here’s how it is. The deal that you had with Smith, that’s our deal now. And if anything happens to me, or anyone that I care about, that file goes public. Am I clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a yes or no question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And one more thing. Whoever it is you think I am, whatever it is you think you know about me, you have no idea what I’m capable of or how far I will go. I am done being afraid. It’s your turn now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s gonna leave a nasty scar. Every time you see it think of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, tell me you didn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We reached an understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But what about your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll get justice for her. Just not today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Til then, I’ll get it for others.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I have the top case closure rate in the precinct. And now that the man that shot me is dead that particular case will no longer be an issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Really? Because it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’m told we put a Michael Smith under guard at the hospital. What was his role in this?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t believe you. You’re covering for someone and I know who it is.

<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does that mean I can show up for duty tomorrow?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I’m pretty sure I’ll think of something.</content></utterance>
