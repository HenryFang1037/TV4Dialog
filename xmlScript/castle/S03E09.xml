</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Twelve letter word for ‘transcendent’.  Otherworldly. Honestly, sometimes it’s like they’re not even trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Doing the crossword in pen. Feeling cocky today, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is life without challenges? Eight letter word for ‘estrange’.  Ah, you are just in time, my mini thesaurus. I need an eight letter word for ‘estrange’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>She doesn’t hear you, darling. She’s still talking to Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should be timing that phone call. That’s got to be a record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Please. I’ve had relationships that didn’t last this long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>True.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sorry. We were talking about the hiking trip next Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, has Ashley got the ‘all clear’ from his parents to come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>They say they want to meet you, first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… they want to vet me to make sure if there’s some kind of rock slide that I won’t leave their boy stranded on a mountainside, having to gnaw off his own arm to survive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So you’ll do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ll have them over for dinner. We’ll schmooze and impress them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Would you like me to cook something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No! We want to impress them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And what is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>So it’s meet the parents time, huh Castle? This is a pretty critical moment for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me? Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I mean Ashley is Alexis’ first love, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you think will happen if you don’t get on with his parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’ll lose interest in him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no. The exact opposite. I mean, it’ll make their romance feel forbidden and they’ll be off doing God knows what. Trust me. I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I never thought of it that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My advice is keep the boyfriend close but the parents closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey guys. What do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Something messed up. I’ve never seen anything like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim’s name is Marie Subbarao. She’s thirty five. Security guard found her last night. He’s still getting over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. She looks like an overstuffed sausage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what the hell happened to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>It’s called explosive decompression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From … what? What would cause this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s the result of exposure to a zero atmosphere environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Zero atmosphere. As in  outer space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t have an 'or' for you right now, sweetie. I have to get her body back to the morgue and then I may have some answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay well, her body’s in a car, in the middle of the rail yard, so clearly she wasn’t killed in outer space. There’s gotta be … another explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Check this out. She was reading Taken By The Fourth Kind. A book on alien abductions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’s your theory, Castle? That she was abducted and then killed by aliens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well… a story that makes more sense is … alien abduction gone wrong. One that ends with Marie accidentally being blasted out of the airlock of the alien spaceship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if it was ET he has a nicotine addiction.  Found a cigarette butt by the rear tire. It was laying in the track, which means it was dropped after the car was parked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right well, have CSU check for DNA. Maybe we’ll get lucky, and can you look into explosive decompression? See what else might cause it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do have to admit – the condition does seem … otherworldly.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Marie Subbarao, the before version. Born in Chicago, did post grad at Johns Hopkins. Two years ago she takes a job at the Aubrey Science Center in Midtown … as an astrophysicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not really sure. According to the Center’s website, she recently landed a grant from the SETI institute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence SETI? That could explain why –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So her working for SETI is just a wild coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m saying it’s an interesting fact that’s unrelated to our case. Aliens were not involved in Marie Subbarao’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um…  I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why Detective Ryan, I never figured you for a believer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All I know is my father’s cousin Raymond left this party in Jersey one night. He’s driving back to Queens and bam! Blinding white light comes down from the sky and the next thing he knows it’s morning and he’s on the Jersey Turnpike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Let me guess, no memory of what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is not called an alien abduction. That is called a hangover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe. Raymond always was the lightweight in the family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.  Speaking of family, did our victim have any? A husband, maybe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Neighbors said she was single and lived alone. They barely saw her. Apparently she normally came home from work around ten PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie said the time of death was around nine PM. Which means work was the last place she was probably seen alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did she do here, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Uh, she analyzed the data fed in from our radio telescope in New Mexico studying radiation from quasars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For the SETI institute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>No, most of her work was NASA-related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Uh … last night. She was still here at her office at seven when I left.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about you, Ms. Holder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>AYYANA HOLDER</speaker><content>Uh, we went over the calendar for next week, then she sent me home at seven thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was she having any problems in life? Anything unusual happening lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Not that I’m aware of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>Actually, since Monday she’d been acting anxious and uptight. I finally asked her what was wrong and she said that something life changing had happened to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>I don’t know. Then on Wednesday she left work in the middle of the day. She didn’t come back until Thursday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Vaughn, Marie’s body showed signs of explosive decompression. Was she doing any kind of research that would account for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That’s a yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>It’s called an altitude chamber. We use it to study thermal life support systems under reduced pressure, for NASA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What would happen if a person went inside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>Without protective gear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>Your lungs rupture from gas expansion and all the liquid in your body evaporates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So all the horrible effects of outer space without the view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who else had access to this area?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Mostly our researchers. And their assistants. Maybe … thirty five people in all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll need a list of all of their names. Did Marie have problems with any of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content> Ted Carter. Her ex-boyfriend. After their breakup things got ugly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>Can I ask what this is about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mr. Carter, your keycard was swiped at the Science Center last night at seven forty two. You mind telling us what you were doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>I went to see someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Marie Subbarao?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>Why is this any of your business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re investigating her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>What? Marie’s not dead. How could she be dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Someone put her in an altitude chamber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>Oh my God. Who could have done something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She was killed at around nine PM, not long after you arrived at the Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>Not me. It wasn’t me! How could you think I would do something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You had motive. You had access to the chamber. Why else would you even go and see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>To ask her to dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>After Marie dumped you and had you fired, you hoped she –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>It wasn’t like that. I quit. It was too painful to be around her. Then on Wednesday, out of nowhere, she called me. She wanted to go to coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now why would she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>To mend fences, I guess. She gave me back some old T-shirts, some CDs she had of mine. Said she felt bad about the way things ended. I thought maybe we still had a chance, you know? So I went looking for her at the Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What happened when you found her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>Nothing! We talked for a few seconds. She seemed upset about something. I tried to find out what but she was in a hurry to get somewhere, so I left. I went home. I was there by eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Make yourself at home. You’re gonna be here for a while.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>CSU is going through the altitude chamber. Once they get back with forensics we should be able to charge Ted Carter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me this – how did Carter get the body to the rail yard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the altitude chamber is right next to the parking garage, so he probably dumped her body in the car, took it out to the rail yard, and tried to throw us off the trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what would be a better story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm?  We have an earthbound solution to this mystery and you are disappointed. I get it. But that? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon. Marie said she had a life changing event. What could be more life changing than being beamed up by this guy? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon Castle, we all know that there are no such things as alien abductions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yet most abductees report the same experiences. The white light, the memory flashes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s because they all read the same books, so of course they describe the same event. The dark, lonely road, the bright light out of nowhere, memories of being poked and prodded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe the word you’re looking for is ‘probed’. And then of course there’s the alien implant that’s used to track the abductees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That reminds me of the LEGO I got stuck up my nose when I was six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, guys? CSU finished going over the altitude chamber.  Nothing turned up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? I mean, that was the exact machine we were looking for, right in the building where Marie and her ex-boyfriend worked. That had to have been the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> There’s no blood, no tissue. It’s clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That makes no sense whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Check other altitude chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not like they grow on trees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that can’t be the only one around. And look for any other devices that cause the same injuries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll do my best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If it’s not an altitude chamber then what could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Other than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what did you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not the answers I was looking for. Instead, just more questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How deliciously cryptic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Because of the unique nature of Marie’s injuries, I wanted to thoroughly document her condition before conducting the autopsy.  While I was taking the X-rays, I saw this embedded in her sinus cavity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Call me crazy, but that looks just like –  – an alien implant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What could you possibly be looking for by probing up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can we talk about dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no… you couldn’t convince Gram to stay out of the kitchen. I will stock up on antacids and garbage bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, it isn’t that. It’s Ashley’s parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He’s an economics professor. The two of them are serious people, Dad. You may need to be more… buttoned up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can be buttoned up. And if I become unbuttoned, you can discreetly let me know with a brutal kick to the shin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I won’t be there.  They thought it would be better if it was just you and Gram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re going to leave me alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’ll do great. I just … wanted to make sure that you’ll make a good impression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Trust me. So do I.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where do you come down on deficit spending during economic downturn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thank you. I take the theory that’s held by most economists: That deficit spending is acceptable as long as it focuses on public investments, like infrastructure, defense, education, research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Where did that answer come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Semester of economic theory at NYU. Where did that question come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Trying out conversation starters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we started a conversation so … I guess it worked. Kind of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s for a dinner with Ashley’s parents. He’s this stuffy economist, you know, and I just want to win him over. Get them on my side. But what if they don’t take to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, c’mon Castle. They’ll take to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So long as you don’t act like yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh… nice one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, where do we stand on this mysterious implant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is not an implant. Lanie says that it’s a metal fragment and she’s running tests on it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did it get up her nose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe it’s a piece of the altitude chamber that got lodged up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The altitude chamber we haven’t found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yet. The altitude chamber that we haven’t found..yet. And I’m sure that as soon as we do, it will lead us straight to our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I notice you said ‘killer’ and not ‘Ted Carter’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Carter alibied out. He ordered pizza the night of Marie’s murder and signed for it at eight twenty five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alibis in thirty minutes or less. So at this point, we have no human suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By definition, no suspect means no human suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, one might be coming your way. I checked Marie’s phone logs at work. Turns out she made a 30 minute phone call before she left the Science Center on Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Benny Stryker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Benny Stryker? This Benny Stryker?  Benny Stryker, renowned author of Taken By The Fourth Kind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One and the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>An astrophysicist and a UFOlogist? Isn’t’ that like oil and water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Actually, they used to be colleagues. Three years ago he and Marie were members of the same research team, but Marie was worried that all his UFO talk would destroy their credibility so she had him kicked off the team. From what I hear, there’s been bad blood ever since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where can we find Stryker?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BENNY STRYKER</speaker><content>Imprisoned in a cold, white room. Strange faces staring down at us. These are images that will haunt us, but they’ll also unite us and help us remember. We didn’t choose this, we were chosen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>One more time. We didn’t choose this, we were chosen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He’s like the Tony Robbins of alien abduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>I see we have some new members. Maybe you’d like to introduce yourself. Tell us your story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>Do you actually think I had something to do with Marie’s death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Stryker, where were you on Thursday at nine PM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>At a book singing. In Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you did have recent contact with Marie. In fact, she called you on Wednesday. What was that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>You know, I could tell you, but I see you wouldn’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whatever you say will receive a fair hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>Well, that hasn’t been my experience.  Marie called me last week in crisis. She picked up anomalous sub microwave bursts on her radio telescope. Was not just the background noises of the universe. It was a signal coming from somewhere nearby, with a repetitive pattern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As in, contact?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>Or so she believed. So she booked more time on a radio telescope array and studied that section of the sky, which is when the trouble started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>Lost time. Four hours on Sunday, just gone. Then she started having mental flashbacks. A white room, a blurry face, questioning her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are we saying Marie was abducted by aliens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>The classic indicators where there. I just tried to help her make sense of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After Marie called you on Wednesday, she left the Center. Do you know where she went?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>She said she was going to get proof of what she knew was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Proof of aliens. And did she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>I never heard from her again. I assumed they stopped her before she got to close to the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>The government. I warned her she was probably being followed. By men determined to keep the existence of aliens a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s like that Will Smith movie. Only, I’m guessing, a lot less funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>STRYKER</speaker><content>These agents are real, Mr. Castle. They fear the revelation that we are not alone would be too shocking. Hysteria would break out. Nations would crumble. That’s why they try to discredit believers like me and eliminate people who threaten to expose the truth. People like Marie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bookstore confirms that Stryker was signing his opus between seven and ten PM. Looks like we’re back to an empty space in the suspect column.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but at least our timeline is making more sense. This whole Sunday-ish area. The life changing event? That’s when she was abducted. Wednesday she leaves work. That’s when she was looking for proof of alien life. Thursday she comes back to work, feeling better, until she leaves and winds up … explosively decompressed.  Overall big week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what this timeline shows me? A lot of erratic behavior that could be due to drug use or any number of medical conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Let’s say that Marie is a drug-addled psychotic with a brain tumor. She still went looking for proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She went looking for what she thought was proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever it was. What if she found it? Where would it be?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle. You don’t actually believe that Klingons are behind this, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Killer aliens is a reach, even for me. But government agents covering up the truth? Not so crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes it is. I mean, when this is all said and done, it will all come down to where and how she was killed. And I bet it will have nothing to do with secret agents or massive government conspiracies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll take that bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did everything go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>Two men came this morning with a federal warrant. They loaded all of Marie’s stuff into a truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who were they? From which agency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>AYYANA</speaker><content>They just said the government.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d like my payment in small bills, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>My contact at Justice says no warrant was issued for Marie’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, people claiming to be federal agents seized her property. I mean, there’s gotta be an explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Men in black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Other than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I’ll put out more feelers. Meantime, keep me posted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marie found proof and they covered it up. It’s just like Benny Stryker said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you honestly expect me to believe a theory, any theory, that ends with “like Benny Stryker said”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What else could it be? Who made off with all her stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe Marie was working on a classified government project and they confiscated her data.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was her data in her furniture? Because they took that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Without knowing who ‘they’ are, we can’t find them.  You know, the key lies in the murder weapon. Esposito, tell me that you’ve located that altitude chamber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I did. At the physics center. At Hudson University. It’s the only other one in five boroughs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s clean. CSU just checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, there’s gotta be another device that does the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie and I looked into that. The only thing we found was an industrial vacuum packer used for food processing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Check into every single one in town. We need to locate that crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle. Just prove that ET did this, bro, please. I hunt people, not machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m working on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we should focus on Marie’s mystery Wednesday trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, finding proof of aliens will not help us catch our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It will if she went somewhere with an industrial vacuum packer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If she did, it was off the Jersey Turnpike. Her EZPass account shows her getting off at exit nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’d she go from there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hard to say. I checked her credit cards. No activity in the area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am mapping it.  ‘New Jersey Turnpike, exit nine.’ Let me share with you the many wonders that await us at exit nine. Oh, there’s an arts center. Uh… state park, with scenic hiking trails and canoeing. An astounding amount of day spas. And the Plainsboro Observatory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>JOY HARRISON</speaker><content>Yeah, Marie was here on Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But she had access to her own telescope. Why would she need this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content>Marie usually worked with a radio telescope. This is an optical telescope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she came here to get a visual on something. Up there. In space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content>She said she picked up signal anomalies. She wanted to see where they were coming from. She took an image capture, then she left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could we get a copy of that image?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content>I checked the telescope’s hard drive. She erased everything. Coordinates, the image capture, it’s all gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She erased everything? What the hell did she see up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marie Subbarao, a sober-minded scientist, believes she was abducted by aliens after intercepting strange radio signals. Using a telescope, she photographs the source of the signal. The next day, dies mysteriously. Then her office is raided by shadowy government agents.  I’m not asking you to dye your hair red and call me 'Mulder.' I would simply ask that you consider the possibility that Marie had knowledge of, or made contact with, something up there that somehow led to her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We will continue our investigation and solve this case and it will have nothing to do with little green men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re grey, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. The truth, the real truth, is out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dead battery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maintenance just replaced it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My phone isn’t working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mine isn’t either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Neither is my watch.  You have a logical explanation for this, too, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>AGENT EASTMAN</speaker><content>Marie Subbarao had information. Information we need.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s what?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but we don’t have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>EASTMAN</speaker><content>Where is it?</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>If you don’t cooperate, we will find a way to get the truth. We’ll do whatever it takes to protect our way of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From what? A woman who thought that she was abducted by aliens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>You’re out of your league, Detective. You have no idea how deep this is. Now where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you? Identify yourself.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, CIA? NSA? MIB? Ooh… shape shifting aliens who only look human?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>No one you could ever reach.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about JFK? Was that the second shooter on the grassy knoll? Third shooter, backed by Mafia? Castro? Mafia and Castro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, whatever you guys are looking for, we don’t know where it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>This is outrageous. An illegal detention of an NYPD detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who says the government is unresponsive? They’re all over this alien cover up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Who are these men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Agents, of some sort. They’re probably the ones that cleared out Marie’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well I’m glad you two are all right. But no one snatches up my people and detains them. I’ll get into this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Those men knew who killed Marie and they refused to tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They also refused to confirm that J. Edgar Hoover liked to wear dresses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm.  Abducted by government agents, huh? C’mon, what were you two really doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not a hickey, Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You both have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wish it was a hickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s from the injectors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that what the kids are calling it these days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They were men in black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we with the vacuum packers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So far I have found over a hundred machines in the five boroughs. CSU’s checking them as fast as they can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the cigarettes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No DNA match. But they are a Chinese brand, only found in Asia or on the black market in Chinatown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So maybe she was killed by an alien. Just an illegal alien.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.  Those hickeys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. So, tech just went through your vehicle. Turns out you were hit with an EMP - an electromagnetic pulse – which knocked out all the electronics. And here’s how they found you in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tracers, listening devices … they must have been watching the science center. That’s when they put these … accessories in my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe that’s what was up Marie’s nose. Perhaps they were tracking her, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, it wasn’t a tracer or an implant. Lanie identified it as a spurgulus. It’s a rare calcification resulting from a sinus infection. The calcification is so dense, it reads like metal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> There you go. Logical explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I would disguise my tracking implant as a rare medical –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You know, bottom line is that these guys were desperate to get whatever Marie took, so we’ve got to find it first because that will lead us to the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but we really don’t know what we’re looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But we do know that they don’t have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means it wasn’t in Marie’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She maybe hid it somewhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe with someone she trusted. Somebody under the radar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ted Carter said that Marie gave him some of his stuff back last Wednesday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe that’s not all she gave him.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>I don’t understand. It’s just books and T-shirts, mostly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Carter, did you notice anything different in the things that she gave you? Anything that wasn’t there before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>TED</speaker><content>No, it’s all my stuff. T-shirts, Jefferson Starship CD –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh! This CD got me through two weeks of Storm Watch writer’s block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t remember it being a two disc set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This one’s unmarked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marie’s proof, perhaps?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, oh … wait.  That’s it? I mean, no pomp? No circumstance? What’s on this could shake the very foundations of our existence. We need to pause and savor –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, let’s just stick it in and get it over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean, the fact of the matter is there’s probably nothing of any value on that CD to our investi –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Behold this image, gentlemen. And lady. We are witness to a stunning event, a turning point in history. The moment that we knew, we are not alone. For who can deny that this  is an alien spacecraft!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It does kind of look like one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but this image? I mean, it’s gotta be doctored. Right, Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Woah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are you saying? Are you saying you think that this is real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t look doctored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, just for clarity, so we know later who said what, you are conceding that it is a possibility that this is an alien spaceship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What I am saying is that we now know what these agents were after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And as far as I’m concerned, let a higher pay grade deal with it. We now have leverage that we can use with our mystery agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How? It’s not like we can just call them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm.  Uh, we…  do have a box of bugs. It’s the next best thing to a Bat Phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have what you want. You know where we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You really think that’s going to work?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please take a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>So where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not a chance. I want something in return. The name of Marie Subbarao’s killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Ladies first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Why are you showing me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the photo that Marie took from the Observatory. Of the alien ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>I’ll be on my way now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. We had a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>You said you had what I want. As it happens, you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You’re not leaving. Marie Subbarao was murdered in the most awful way imagined. And her killer is still out there. You owe it to her. Give us that name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Maybe she isn’t who you think she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s that supposed to mean? I mean, if it’s not this, then what? Why all this fuss over an astrophysicist who analyzed radio signals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless what she analyzed was secret. That’s it, isn’t it? She intercepted classified information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you did say that she took something that was vital to our security. And we found Chinese cigarettes at the crime scene. Was she working with the Chinese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, either you tell us the truth now or we take what we know to the media.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>What makes you think they’ll print it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, they probably won’t. But I know more than a dozen bloggers that will. Not to mention over half a million of my own followers on Twitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Nothing I say can leave this room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You have our word on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Last month we determined that an enemy operative had intercepted classified, coded data streams between the Pacific Fleet and the Pentagon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think it was Marie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>The intercepted transmissions coincided with Marie’s tasking her radio telescope to point at our satellite, which is nowhere near where she was supposed to be doing her research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that wasn’t a photo of a UFO. That was your spy satellite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>But the real damage done is the data she downloaded, which I fear is now in the hands of the Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then who killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Her handler, I imagine. The Chinese must have known that we were on to them. They were smart enough to make it look like the boyfriend did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Who’s this handler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Someone from Chinese intelligence. We were never able to identify him. Whoever he is, you’ll never catch him. It’s over.</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BOB LINDEN</speaker><content>In the book, I take a bold, new look at the linear aggregation of markets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s about time someone did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BOB</speaker><content>So Ashley tells me you’re an author as well. Tell me about your writing, Mr. Castle. I don’t read popular fiction. I find most of it crass and tawdry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Right. Well, uh … I  I think of my writing as character studies in human behavior, looking into the heart of what makes people tick. For instance, what would make an ordinary person like yourself commit an act that’s unusually heinous or somehow … out of character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you excuse me for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marie was acting out of character. What self respecting espionage agent would act strangely and risk blowing her cover? Maybe she wasn’t the real spy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that might explain the test results that Lanie just sent over. Marie had traces of sodium pentothal in her system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Somebody gave her truth serum? Maybe it was the real spy. The white room, the questions, that’s why Stryker thought she was abducted by aliens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if Marie wasn’t the spy …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then the real spy was someone with access to the radio telescope at the Science Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m heading over there right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll meet you there as soon as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>More wine?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Got another request here, redirecting the telescope to the coordinates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Signed by Marie, just like all the others. Well, out of character or not, looks like she was the spy after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. These two signatures are different. The As don’t match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And look who else makes an A like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Charles Vaughn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He forged her signature to make it look as though Marie was the one intercepting the satellite transmissions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So maybe Marie saw a request with her fake signature and she got curious. So she put in a request of her own to have the telescope scan that part of the sky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s when she intercepted the weird signals. After that she lost time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when she told Benny Stryker about it, he assumed she had been abducted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which she had been. Only not by aliens. By Dr. Vaughn, who drugged her to find out how much she knew. When he realized how close she was, he got rid of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but he’s the one who told us about the altitude chamber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, because he knew it would lead us to Marie’s ex-boyfriend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dr. Vaughn is gone. He’s not at his place. But you know what is? Three vials of sodium pentothal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea where he went?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nope. But it looks like he left in a rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Call TSA and have him put on a no-fly list and keep me posted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s on the run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If he heard we asked for those request forms, he would have been tipped off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He probably had an escape plan in place, just in case his cover was blown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Chinese handlers who can smuggle him out of the country. Not to be negative, but the odds of catching this guy are not great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless we enlist the help of a certain government agent who wants him just as bad as we do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>I may want to put you guys on my friends and family plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We now believe that Dr. Vaughn is the spy. Marie figured it out and then he killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>I’m inclined to agree, which leaves the agency with some egg on its face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And which agency did you say that was again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>I didn’t. We dug deeper on Dr. Vaughn. Turns out he has a fondness for gambling. He ran up quite the tab at an Atlantic City casino controlled by the Chinese. After that they owned him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know where Dr. Vaughn is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>I know where to start looking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Using his cell phone number, I can triangulate his position.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he’s got to be worried about being tracked. He probably turned it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Then we’ll just turn it back on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>We turned off your phones, didn’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah, and the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>He’s in the warehouse district in Chinatown. 1400 block of Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can we get a closer look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There he is. Fancy. You know, that’s just a few block away from where we found Marie’s body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe that’s where he killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who’s that guy?  Oh, wait. He’s the cigarette smoking man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Otherwise known as Ung Kyu. He’s a high level Chinese intelligence agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our murder suspect is meeting his handler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Which means Dr. Vaughn may still have the data.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, let’s go get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are the predator drones? The black helicopters? All those SWAT teams rappelling down on ropes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Budget cuts.  It’s vital to our national security that we take these men alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These guys are trained agents. They probably have cyanide capsules in their teeth in case they’re caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-19"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>We’ll worry about their teeth when the time comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Patrol cars have closed off all streets in a five block radius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And air support’s on their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. What’s the plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-23"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Vaughn’s cell phone signal has gone dark, which means he’s underground. According to our intel, this building has an extensive basement with two methods of ingress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, most of the basements on this side of town are linked through doorways used as escape routes for illegals in case of an INS raid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-25"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>So you’re saying that Vaughn and Kyu could be in either of the adjoining buildings as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Welcome to New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-27"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content> Let’s go.</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. Stay where you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a vacuum packer at one o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like we found our murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you seen this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> My partner is crazy and may start firing at any moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Go, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Semester abroad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, TV show I used to love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh. Nice job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Wait, wait! Wait, I can still help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>Wait, wait! Please don’t! I can help you, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD! Drop that gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>On the ground. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cyanide capsule!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ew  Gum. False alarm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content> Where’s the data?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>VAUGHN</speaker><content>In a USB drive. In his pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Think we’ll get a medal for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>This never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guess that means I can’t put this on Twitter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, a near execution will shake your loyalties like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Between his conviction and the espionage charges, he and Ung Kyu will spend the rest of their lives in federal prison, thanks to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And to Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>WESTFIELD</speaker><content>Yes, Mr. Castle.  Might I have private word with Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, sweetie. Look, about the parental review. I failed and I know and I’m sorry.  Woah, woah, woah, woah … they … they found me fascinating?  Camping with … they want to go camping with us? No, no! No, no, it’s … yeah, that’d be great.  That’ll be so much fun. Mmhmm. I love you too. ‘Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what’d he tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, he told me something in confidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I wish I could tell you, Castle, but … it was classified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What … what did he tell you that was classified? Was it about aliens?  The truth about UFOs? Are you going to tell me or just make me keep guessing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I don’t know. This guessing thing is kind of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Was it about what happened at Roswell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Area 51.</content></utterance>
