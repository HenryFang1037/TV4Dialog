<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Another shot of you and the chanting masses. I’m so over this protest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Next time we’ll do a piece on Brazilian runway models. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Gonna hold you to that. All right, let’s roll this puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content> Roger that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Hey Ringo! You’re messing up sound! How ‘bout you take it somewhere else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Okay, live in 3 … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>I’m here at Boylan Plaza on day 36 of the takeover protest. Hundreds have gathered here and in cities across the country to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption from –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Oh my God.  If you’ve just tuned in, there’s been some kind of explosion on the southeast side of the Boylan Plaza. We do not know what caused this or if there are injuries but I can see  what appear to be people on the ground not moving.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s unbelievable. Any idea how many people were killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Initial reports say 5 dead, 28 injured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s Feds everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that’s normal procedure in the event of a bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing normal about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Do they think this was a terrorist attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No comment. You’ll have to deal with press relations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>Oh, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>NYPD’s over there. FBI’s taking jurisdiction of the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>FBI turned you guys away too, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, they wouldn’t let us past the crime scene tape. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Gates is talking to the Feds, trying to get a handle on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we know about the explosion? Who set it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It probably wasn’t a suicide bomber. I got a friend who’s a medic, said there were no explosive vests on any of the bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Everything else is just rumor at this point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Listen up, people! We’re still piecing together what happened here, but what I can tell you is that FBI and Homeland Security will be taking point on this investigation. NYPD will act in a support capacity. Our first assignment is to see if any of the victims were targeted because of their involvement in the protest. Uniforms are bringing families to the precinct as we speak, so let’s go hold some hands and do our jobs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Lavine, I understand one of the victims, Jesse Friedman, worked closely with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>LAVINE</speaker><content>It was more than that. He was a friend. A comrade in arms, you know? Jesse was a recruiter. When attendance dropped a couple weeks back, even I thought it was time to pack up. But Jesse just threw my favorite quote back at me. The one about sinning by silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>“To sin by silence when we should protest makes …”  “…cowards of men.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We know this is difficult, but what was your husband’s involvement with the takeover movement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>VAL BROOKSTONE</speaker><content>Matt wasn’t involved. Neither am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So why were you at Boylan Plaza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>VAL</speaker><content>It’s our first time here. We wanted to take in as much as we could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re tourists?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>VAL</speaker><content>We’d just been to the top of the Empire State Building. We had an extra few minutes, so we decided to see what the protest was all about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>VAL</speaker><content>Matt and I just bought a house.  We were going to start a family. We had all these plans. What am I going to do now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Just… this case, you know? Kind of gets to you.  How’d it go with the rest of the families?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um …  One victim was the first kid in his family to go to college, and the other was the mother of 2, so ..  … about like you’d expect. No one seems to have been targeted, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So their deaths were at random.  You know, most of our victims, they – they die for a reason, you know? There’s a logic behind it. It’s a twisted logic at times, but at least it makes some kind of sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but in this case these people were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And their future and all their plans, everything is just gone in a flash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It makes you think about all those things in your own life that you don’t want to put off anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain’s gathering the troops.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Now that it appears that this attack was not directed at any specific individual we’ve got a new assignment for the FBI.  We all know where the bomb went off. It was here,  right next to this lamppost. The FBI just recovered this photo from a protester’s cell phone.  It’s of the same location taken 47 seconds before the explosion. That could only mean one thing. The bomb was placed here by someone within our 47 second time period.  Our task it to interview all witnesses who were present at Boylan Plaza.  We’re looking for anyone who saw what went on by this lamppost before the blast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, there are over 300 names on this list. How do you recommend that we proceed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We bring in more shifts. Someone on that list saw the bomb being planted within our 47 second window. We find that person, we find the bomber.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that was … unhelpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m starting to sense a pattern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, this next woman says she was in the middle of the whole thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>We were right here. It’s like the bomb went off right next to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>Me and my sister Nadia. She’s out there right now, waiting. Should I go get her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no. Actually it’s better if we just talk one on one. Now were the two of you participating in the protest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>Do I look like I’m in the 99%?  No. We’d just left this bridal boutique near the plaza. Nadia’s getting married in June.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And did you notice anyone standing near the light post?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to need you to tell us everything that you remember from just before the bombing, starting with where you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>We were at the coffee truck, just trying to figure out our next move.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>I’m a little shopped out, Nadia. I mean, you tried on 11 dresses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>It made me look like a stay-puffed marshmallow. We have to keep looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>Can we look from home online?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>I’m not buying my wedding dress on the internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>It’s just to give us ideas. We need to regroup. You are this close to Bridezilla territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>Well maybe I’ll wear jeans to my wedding. Maybe we can hire that guy as the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>That’s mine! Give it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>Could you imagine the look on Mom’s face –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>Damn it! Watch where you’re going. This is my –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>The force of it knocked us on our asses. Nadia almost got trampled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, can you go back to the Middle Eastern man carrying the box. You said that he was sweaty and nervous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And was he headed toward the lamppost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CORINNE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you remember his face well enough to help us with a sketch?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Westside Wally. Back by popular demand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>C’mon, Kojak. You know I prefer Westside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Westside, then. Uh … did you ever see that man in the plaza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>No. The guy’s not familiar. Then again, lots of people, lots of faces. Plus, I was over here.  That’s my usual spot. Not by the coffee truck. I don’t care for the smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That puts you 50 feet away from where the bomb went off. Did you have a clear view of this lamppost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>Not really, man. And you know I always try to help Johnny Law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you notice anything out the ordinary in the minute before the explosion? Anyone suspicious?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BEETHOVEN</speaker><content>We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Stop! Let me understand this. You – you saw Beethoven? The composer who’s been dead for 200 years in Boylan Plaza this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>Oh yeah.  And I bet that half-deaf bastard is behind all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Westside, are you on any medications of any kind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>WESTSIDE WALLY</speaker><content>I don’t see how that’s relevant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What do you mean we have no leads? What about the Middle Eastern man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We interviewed him. He cleared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that box he was carrying? Full of Chinese takeout. The most dangerous thing in there was MSG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, the fact is is that we interviewed 94 people and we’ve got nothing to show for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ah … this is not the news I was hoping for. Especially since the FBI sent this over.  It was emailed to two other takeover locations an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> “You were warned to stop the protest. You didn’t listen. Start listening now or today’s bombing will be just the beginning.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s going to hit another protest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The FBI’s keeping this one under wraps. But the clock is still ticking here and what you’re telling me is that we’re no closer to getting this guy than we were when the bomb went off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, somebody on this list saw exactly what happened within that 47 second window, but the problem is is that they’re mixed in with all of these people that saw absolutely nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like trying to find Waldo in a sea of Waldos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I take it you have a proposal to fix that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If the FBI would let us view all video shot in the plaza then maybe we can figure out who was closest to the bomb, start prioritizing the interviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll go down there, do my best.  And if that doesn’t work, we’ll look to plan B. In the meantime, keep working on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She doesn’t seem very optimistic about getting that footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the witnesses that were closest to the bomb aren’t on our list.  Maybe dead men do tell tales.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>I just saw a reporter in reception. Have security get him out of here. I don’t want him bothering the victims' families.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> So nice to see a friendly face. FBI’s been up in mine all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All from the explosion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> They never had a chance. If you’re looking for official cause of death, it’s multiple blunt force trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we were wondering if there was anything on the bodies that might lead us to whoever did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Possible.  Meet Jesse Friedman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was the recruiter for the takeover movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He was also the guy closest to the blast and we found bits of this imbedded all over his skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Blue fabric?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Lab ID’d it as canvas. They also found high concentrations of explosive residue on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The canvas was part of whatever contained the bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So a duffel or a suitcase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a huge break. That means we’re looking for someone carrying a blue bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go update Captain Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, can you just give me a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, honey. How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I just needed a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look exhausted. How long’ve you been here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m not sure. It’s been so crazy. I’ve been cataloguing the victims' personal effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well that can’t be easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It was fine. Then I saw how one of them had on this bracelet strung with beads, made by a little kid and it was like that bracelet that I made you for Father’s Day when I was 6. Do you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Remember? I still have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon. Let’s get you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, I should stay. There’s still work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And it’ll be here tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dr. Parish said I had to get all this finished before she –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lanie will tell you the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s get you out of here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>All right, let’s roll this puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>LEANN WEST</speaker><content>Roger that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>NEWCASTER</speaker><content>That was our very own Leann West about to report live from Boylan Plaza yesterday. Moments later tragedy struck. Be aware, some of the images we’re about to show you may be disturbing to some viewers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Hundreds have gathered here and in cities across the country to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption from –  Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>NEWSCASTER</speaker><content>So far no suspects have been named in the bombing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>You’re welcome.  So how’s our – how’s our girl doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s upstairs, in bed, asleep. Wish I could keep her in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Honey, do you ever wonder why I never visited you at the precinct the first year you were working there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I always thought it was because of the harsh lighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, that was a consideration.  No, I thought if I – if I saw you acting like a cop, I’d start thinking of you as a cop and I just  – that – that brought on all manner of nightmares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you get over it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Eventually you realize your children are going to make choices you don’t like.  Just a fact of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if the bombing proves anything it’s that bad things can happen no matter what you do.  No one’s tomorrow is guaranteed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So … how do you plan to act on this realization?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, you know what I mean. Richard, how much longer are you going to drag your heels before you tell Beckett how you feel – and I mean while she is awake, not lying on the ground with a bullet in her chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t understand. It’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s complicated, so you say. Only, it’s not.  It’s not. Nobody’s tomorrows are guaranteed, right? Wouldn’t it be better to tell her, even if the timing is wrong, than never to tell her at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what if she isn’t ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Then she never will be. Then you move on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You got a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um…  I’ve been thinking. About the victims and all the opportunities they’ll never have. And I don’t want that to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve been –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett? We’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s okay.  It can wait until after the case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get the video from the plaza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Not yet, but what I’ve got here is even better. Data from wireless carriers that shows us all the activated cellphones in Boylan Plaza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is the plaza yesterday at 4:32 right before the explosion. Each red dot represents the GPS position of a specific phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you get this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I called in a favor from a friend at Homeland Security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is a damn good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if those red dots represent cell phones could we figure out who they belong to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That’s the whole idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This shows us who was closest to the bomb. It gives us our witnesses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It can even show us where everyone was in real time.  Advance it to 4:32.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The dots that disappeared, that’s the explosion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a second. Did you guys see that? It was – uh, before the bomb went off. Could you – Ryan, could you take it back 10 seconds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That dot right there. Right before the explosion. It goes to the blast site, waits for a second, and then rushes away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Play it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the bomber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll see if I can pull up his ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Cell phone’s registered to an Andrew Haynes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Tell me where he is right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No GPS signal. Uh … his battery’s either dead or his phone is off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Haynes sounds familiar.  He showed up in the precinct 20 minutes ago for an interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The bomber’s in the building?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Unis gave him a full body. No weapons, no explosives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He still thinks he’s here as a witness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We told him the search was routine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So this is Andrew Haynes. What’s his story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He has it out for the takeover movement. He’s organized counterdemonstrations, disrupted their rallies. He’s even handed out flyers saying how they should be stopped by any means necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He walks the walk, too. He was a suspect in the bombing of some Greenpeace offices a few years back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything turn up at his place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Smoking gun. Unis found receipts to an internet café where he goes. They traced those threats back to that café and Haynes’ login ID. He’s our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then why is she strolling in here just as cool as can be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My guess? He’s proud of what he’s done. Can’t wait to tell someone about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then let’s give him the opportunity to do just that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi, Mr, Haynes. I’m Detective Kate Beckett.  Thanks so much for coming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ANDREW HAYNES</speaker><content>It’s about time you brought me in here. I had to rub elbows with those whiney little troublemakers.  I was going to do something drastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh yeah well, I wouldn’t blame you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>A free thinker. I respect that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, you know, my personal feelings aside I still have to investigate this incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Yeah, you know. You got to dot your I’s and cross your T’s. I get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly. So I just have to ask you a few questions about what you saw just before the bombing, starting with  where you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Uh …  I – I was like, right up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, so that’s about 100 feet from the blast site?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what were you doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Oh, I was pretty much getting hassled.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Hey, nimrod! Educate yourself.  Here, why don’t you give this a read? Hey Garanimal pants. Quit the pity party. Get a frickin’ job. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.  Hello? Hey, I’m talking to you! Kitten, can you take –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>What’s your problem? You don’t like what I have to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Huh? Can’t face the truth?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, just - just so I’m clear. So you were debating with the protestors until that bomb went off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Yeah, I was trying to give them a reality check. You know, they’re all up in arms about the greedy corporations. Who do they think is creating the jobs? You know, they’re a bunch of silver spoon hypocrites. I mean, half of them, they don’t – they don’t even know what they’re protesting against.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, and stopping them would actually be a service to this country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Yeah, it’d be item number 1 on any true patriot’s to-do list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you are a true patriot, aren’t you? –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>You’re damn right about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Andrew, that’s why you put that bomb in the plaza. To defend the country that you love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Andrew. I don’t want you to have to serve any more time than you have to. We know that you weren’t with those protesters. You were down here,  dropping off the bomb and then running for cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We traced your phone. The GPS places you right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>You can’t prove it was me. I lost my phone yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, then maybe you can explain this.  Threatening emails that you sent from an internet café promising to continue those bombings until the protest stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>I’d like to talk to my lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>White male, antisocial loner, extreme political views. He’s a perfect fit for the profile BSU worked up for us. We’ll continue questioning him downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, according to my people, he’s nowhere near confessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>We’ll have them reinterview the witnesses and find us someone that saw Haynes put that backpack down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So it's up to 20 witnesses along Haynes’ GPS path but none of them could positively ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>With all the confusion no one’s exactly sure what happened. You guys have any luck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>4 people remember seeing a guy in a black takeover hoodie but nobody remembers seeing his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A black hoodie doesn’t get us home. Not with half the protesters wearing them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Somebody must have seen this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a protester that we haven’t talked to yet. The street drummer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After the cameraman rousted him, that bridesmaid said he relocated by the coffee truck, which would put him right in Haynes’s path.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he could have seen Haynes’s face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but we don’t know his name and he’s not on our witness list. How’re we going to find this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? He’s a street performer. He’s probably got nuisance citations which means if he has we should be able to ID him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>I make music. Why did you arrest me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not arresting you, Malik. We just need to ask you a few questions about what you saw in Boylan Plaza yesterday afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>I know nothing about the bomb. I am an innocent man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But we think that you might have seen something that will help us catch the person that did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>I – I don’t want trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Malik, your visa expired, didn’t it? Is that what’s worrying you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>I cannot go back to my country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I won’t make you. I don’t care about your immigration status. We just need to know exactly what you saw just before that explosion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content> I will tell you what I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When you were playing by the coffee truck a man walked by you wearing a black takeover sweatshirt. Do you remember seeing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>Yes. I saw him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, are you saying you saw the man wearing the black takeover sweatshirt put down a blue backpack in front of the lamppost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And did you get a good look at his face?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>Damn it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re certain the man you saw leaving the backpack was Hispanic and in his 20s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>I – I give the wrong answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure this wasn’t the person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>MALIK</speaker><content>No. It’s not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The FBI’s got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means the real bomber is still out there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>If Andrew Haynes didn’t plant the bomb then why did he email those threats? Why does his GPS show him fleeing the scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We can’t answer that yet but our witness gave a good description.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was this man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>How do we know this guy’s not making this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, the details of the bomb haven’t been released to the press yet, so how would our witness know about the blue backpack unless he actually saw it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>AGENT JOHNSON</speaker><content>All right, you people pursue this. See where it leads. But Andrew Haynes is still our prime suspect. At least until you can give me more than the word of a street musician.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Identifying this man, that is now our top priority. According to our witness he was wearing a takeover sweatshirt so he might be part of the movement. Show the sketch around, talk to other protesters. If he was a regular in Boylan Plaza someone must know who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Not you, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I have a special task for you. I hear you’re quite the speed reader. And in the time that I’ve known you, you’ve shown …well, on occasion, an exceptional attention to detail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the first time you’ve ever paid me a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We’ve conducted over 100 interviews so far and someone needs to review them swiftly, looking for information that can ID our suspect.  And I believe you’re my best bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think she’s finally starting to like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No. I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m wearing her down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Morning. Any breaks in the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I’m pouring over these witness statements, looking for clues about our bomber, but so far nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well. Maybe these will bring you some luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are emergency cheering-up pancakes. I mean, these are usually reserved for after breakups or Dancing with the Stars eliminations. What’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, after the other day I thought we both needed some cheering up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You shouldn’t need cheering up. You shouldn’t have even been there. You should have been with your friends or at the movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I’m 18.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. I know. It’s just … you’re going to see plenty of reality in your lifetime. I just would like you to keep the rose color on your glasses for as long as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I’m trying not to focus on the ugly side of it, Dad. I’ve gotten straight As, awards, more trophies than I can count. This job is the first thing that’s made me feel like I’m doing something important. Valuable. I mean, isn’t that why you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re a pretty smart kid, you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well. They say genius skips a generation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently so does funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Eat your pancake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … nothing.  I’m thinking about my next move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I may have it for you.  We got a line on this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone ID’d the sketch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Protester named Jenny Klein says she knows this guy as Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And there’s no last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but this Bobby invited her over once. She knows where he lives.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Remove the backpack and place it on the ground, slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then get on your knees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just a bunch of gym clothes and some water bottles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not like last time, huh Bobby?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Robert Lopez. That’s your name. Right Bobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually I know quite a bit about you. I know where you live, I know you don’t have a record, I know you’re not a member of any political party, and as soon as my team finishes searching your place I’m going to know even more. Eventually I’ll find out, but why don’t you just tell me.  Why did you plant that bomb?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.  No luck with those witness statements. You guys catch a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Better yet, we caught the suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I missed it? Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>In the box. With Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you like me to refresh your memory?  You were standing here, by the lamppost. You dropped the backpack and started running as it exploded, killing 5 people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I didn’t do what you’re saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Witnesses saw you drop your backpack, Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>It wasn’t mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so you admit to having it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>No, that’s – that’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You just said that it wasn’t yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Yeah, because you got me all confused with –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you or didn’t you have it? It’s a simple question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who put you up to this, Bobby? Who gave you that backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I don’t – I don’t know. I don’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t remember. How do you not remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I was in shock. The bomb went off. Everyone was running and screaming and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, okay, so you remember what happened after the bomb went off but not before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>It must have been one of those traumatic amnesia things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby.  Don’t lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-18"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I’m telling you, it was all a big blank. It was the trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was not the trauma. You do not get to use that excuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-20"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I swear I don’t remember!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hell you don’t remember. Do you want to know trauma? I was shot in the chest and I remember every second of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All this time. You remembered?</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Guy’s still not talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not yet. I’m gonna let him sweat for a bit.  Was Castle here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Earlier. But he said he had to go. Said there was somewhere he needed to be.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>She isn’t dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She might as well be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I really thought we could have a future together. You know, I was – I was willing to wait.  Turns out it’s all just a big joke.  She knew. This whole time, she remembered. And she didn’t say anything  … because she was embarrassed because she doesn’t feel the same way. I’m such a fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well c’mon. Let’s go home. Break out some of the good stuff, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well I’d love to. I’ve got to be getting back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no. This isn’t about her. This is – this is about them.  You know? It’s about doing something real. Something that matters. I’m not willing to let that go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uniforms are searching his place. We’re hoping to find something that’ll break him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>FBI called with an update. The device used in Boylan Plaza was a pipe bomb. But here’s the weird part. It wasn’t packed with nails, ball bearings, or anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is weird. Bombers usually add projectiles to maximize damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not the only way to maximize damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, so what was it triggered by? Cell phone? Trip wire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A remote, probably rigged from a garage door opener. But the range on those is only about 100 feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So whoever detonated it was in Boylan Plaza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I bet you we’ll find that garage remote in Bobby’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah … no such luck. But we did find credit cards with lots of different names on them  and we found some wallets  and some cell phones, too. In fact, one of those cell phones belonged to Andrew Haynes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby’s a pickpocket.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Yeah, I pretty much am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why you attended the takeover protests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>All those people were hanging out full of peace and brotherhood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>ANDREW HAYNES</speaker><content>Hey nimrod. Educate yourself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like an all-you-can-steal buffet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>You got that right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you just tell me the truth from the start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>And what? Admit to a cop who likes me for murder that I’m a thief? Amnesia seemed like the better plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  So you lifted Andrew Haynes’s phone, which is why it looked as if he planted the bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-6"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Who’s Andrew Haynes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t worry about that. Talk to me about the backpack. How did you get it?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I lifted it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="48"><utterance uid="48-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>It was just lying there between two dumpsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-2"><speaker>JESSE FRIEDMAN</speaker><content>Hey! Hey! That’s mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Hey, that’s mine! Give that back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey, that’s my bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-5"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Come back! Come back, hey you!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="49"><utterance uid="49-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I swear, I didn’t know a bomb was in it.  I would never hurt anyone. Look, you gotta believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The man who said that you took his backpack, is that him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s – that’s the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="50"><utterance uid="50-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="51"><utterance uid="51-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s Jesse Friedman. That’s one of the victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he’s a member of the movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That doesn’t make any sense. Why would he attack his own people?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="52"><utterance uid="52-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So unis searched Jesse Friedman’s place and they found research on how to build the same device that was used in Boylan Plaza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Jesse blew up his own protest? Why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe to … get sympathy for his movement? Publicity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And because he placed the bomb between two dumpsters he didn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- didn’t think that anyone would get hurt. Then Bobby stole the backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Jesse was worried about someone getting hurt why would he set off the bomb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t think he did. There was no remote on or near the body which means someone else detonated it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Probably someone he knew. 30 seconds before the blast Jesse got a call on his cell from a burner cell. Then 2 seconds before the bomb went off he tried to call that same phone back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then maybe Jesse had a partner and that’s who triggered the bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said that remote had a range of about 100 feet, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoever the partner was he must have been here somewhere, close to the bomb blast, hidden amongst the crowd.  We need to take another look at the sequence of events. Piece together the witness statements. The answer is in the story. So let’s start at the beginning.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="53"><utterance uid="53-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leann and her cameraman are setting up for their live broadcast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-2"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Make sure you get the crowd in the background, Mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-3"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Another shot of you and the chanting masses. I’m so over this protest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-4"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Yeah, next time we’ll do a piece on Brazilian runway models. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-5"><speaker>MARK</speaker><content>Gonna hold you to that. All right, let’s roll this puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-6"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Roger that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At the same time, Bobby’s prowling the plaza. He sees Andrew Haynes haranguing the protesters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-8"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Stop the pity party. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps. Hey nimrod, educate yourself. Why don’t you give this a read.  Hey Garanimal pants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="54"><utterance uid="54-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s easy pickin’s.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="55"><utterance uid="55-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Bobby relieves him of his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-2"><speaker>ANDREW</speaker><content>Educate yourself, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then Bobby goes looking for his next business opportunity. He spots the blue backpack unattended, calling out to him. So he grabs it, blissfully unaware of what’s inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-4"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey, that’s mine!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="56"><utterance uid="56-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Jesse sees him and he flips out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="57"><utterance uid="57-1"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>That’s mine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-2"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Give that back! Hey! Hey, that’s mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bobby ducks out of sight. Jesse panics. The bomb is on the move. What’s he gonna do? People are in danger. He grabs a man in the black hoodie, thinking it’s the thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-4"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>What’s your problem? You don’t like what I have to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-5"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-6"><speaker>HAYNES</speaker><content>Huh? Can’t face the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But it’s Andrew Haynes. Well by now, Bobby’s decided taking the backpack wasn’t such a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he ditches it and keeps moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-9"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>Could you imagine the look on Mom’s face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-10"><speaker>NADIA</speaker><content>Damn it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bam. They knock into each other, drawing the attention of the street drummer who’s now by the coffee truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="57-12"><speaker>OPERATOR</speaker><content>The subscriber you are trying to reach is not available –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="58"><utterance uid="58-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, that’s a nice story bro, but it still doesn’t tell us who Jesse’s partner is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well it’s gotta be whoever Jesse was on the phone with in the minutes before the bomb went off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long was that first incoming call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … 8 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that was probably the ‘all systems go’ call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then after the backpack was stolen Jesse tried to make an ‘all systems not go’ call but he didn’t get through in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do any of the witnesses remember who Jesse was hanging out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet but we’re still reconstructing his movements based on statements on his friends –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="58-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh!  A Beethoven T-shirt.  Call and response. I know who Jesse’s partner is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="59"><utterance uid="59-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bobby remembered hearing a Beethoven ringtone coming from nearby just before he stole the backpack. And Westside Wally said Beethoven showed up conducting his 5th Symphony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="59-2"><speaker>BEETHOVEN</speaker><content>We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="60"><utterance uid="60-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was actually Jesse Friedman with his Beethoven T-Shirt and ringtone making his ‘all systems go’ call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="61"><utterance uid="61-1"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content> We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="61-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We know he was talking to someone within 100 feet and that call lasted 8 seconds, long enough for a call and response. A call and response to the one person who could broadcast the explosion live on television and bring the publicity that the movement needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="61-3"><speaker>JESSE</speaker><content> We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="61-4"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Roger that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="61-5"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>I’m here at Boylan Plaza on day 36 of the takeover protest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="62"><utterance uid="62-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leann West was on the other end of that phone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="63"><utterance uid="63-1"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>No I wasn’t. I wasn’t on the phone with anyone. I was talking to my cameraman. I already told the FBI the whole story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, except you left out a few details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like the fact that you knew Jesse Friedman. The two of you went to Hudson University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-4"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>Yeah, so did a lot of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re guessing the two of you reunited at the protest. You went out for drinks and you hatched a plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wanted media attention, you wanted to get promoted to the anchor desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you set up your cameras at the perfect vantage point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You waited until you went live and you detonated that bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-9"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>What? That is insane. This is ridiculous and I will not listen to another word of it. We’re done here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize that? That’s the burner cell that you used to call Jesse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Found it in a storm drain about two block from Boylan Plaza. You know what else we found in there?  The remote you used to detonate the bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Small enough to hide in the palm of your hand. It’s got your fingerprints all over it, Leann.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-13"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>How did you find that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By tracking your movements after the explosion using your phone’s GPS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-15"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>No one was supposed to get hurt. It was just going to make a lot of noise and people would start respecting me as a reporter but everything just went wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you just come forward when you realized what you had done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-17"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content>I thought about it, but what good would that do? I kept quiet for Jesse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-18"><speaker>LEANN</speaker><content> I wanted to protect his memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="63-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s what your friend Jesse would call sinning by silence.  It’s not smart, it’s not brave. It’s just cowardly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="64"><utterance uid="64-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The FBI has taken Leann West into custody. This woman, whose blind ambition lead to the death of 5 people, will get what she deserves. I um, I want to thank each of you for what you did to make this happen. You all put into 110% and made me proud. So let’s get out of here, head on home, and catch up on some much needed rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? I’m still kind of wired. Do you guys want to go out for a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah… sorry. I feels like a month since I’ve seen Jenny. I should really get home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Me too. I’m tanked. I’ll holler at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I guess it’s just us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, now that the case is done, what did you want to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. Nothing important anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m gonna head home. Night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="64-11"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
