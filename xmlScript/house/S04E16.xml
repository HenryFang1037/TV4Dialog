<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Someone is dying because I can't remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> It was Amber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>Her heart won't stop racing. No idea what's causing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Sure it wasn't the bus that landed on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>It's not trauma. She was stable post-op. This didn't start until an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Delayed reaction to the trauma. She lost both her kidneys in the bus crash. She ripped up her femoral artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>We fixed the artery, got her on dialysis for the kidneys. Whatever's doing this to her heart, it isn't from the crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Check her potassium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Why didn't you call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>She's been under the whole time. She had no ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Pushed adenosine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>And verapamil, and floated the swan an hour ago.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>You wanna move her? Her heart rate is a hundred and thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's hemodynamically stable. We're moving her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ATTENDING DOCTOR</speaker><content>You're not her doctor. You can't make that decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Her husband can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Why was she on the bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I don't know. If she had any underlying condition, the accident could have exacerbated it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Why were you with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I don't know! I'm not hiding anything. I just don't remember. What else could damage her heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Wilson, don't get lost! I'm barely coherent. I need your help right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>V-fib!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Charging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait! Protective hypothermia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You wanna freeze her? Her heart's not beating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Her heart's already damaged. If you restart it, it'll keep racing, shoot off free radicals, and kill her brain. We ice her down, put her on bypass until you've diagnosed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>This is not a solution. All you're doing is pressing pause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>It gives you more time to find a diagnosis. House, this is Amber!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Please.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content> She's stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Why are we doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Bought us time to think.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The trauma must have stimulated a pre-existing heart condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Autoimmune congenital anomaly, blood clotting disorder, lead poisoning...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Great! Let's explore that. Quick, get her on panacea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>We can narrow it down by looking for arterial blockages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>How? On an echo? Can't see wall motion when there's no motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>EKG, nope. Heart's in the off position. Thallium uptake scan? Useless on a cold heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Yeah, we get it. Her heart's not beating. It's gonna make it harder to diagnose. On the other hand, she's not gonna die while you're whining about it. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>There is another way to narrow it down. If you really did see a symptom in Amber before the crash, physostigmine helped your memory last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Why not cyanide? He's a mess. He needs to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I had a heart attack this morning. Can't do any more drugs till lunch. Get her an angiogram. Could show damage even in a stopped heart. Rest of you search her apartment. Toxins, heavy metals, drugs, anything that might make her heart race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>I need to know if there's anything medically relevant that you couldn't share publicly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Is this a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>You were obviously drinking last night. Maybe you took Amber to a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I left here on my motorcycle alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>You ended up drunk on a bus together. Maybe you met Amber in the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I was not having an affair with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>You can't really say that if you don't remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I lost four hours, not four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Maybe it was the first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>If you drank together, any chance you did any drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> I'll run a tox screen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>You comin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Correspondence, letters to patients, she could have caught something from one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Travel. Do you know if she's been out of the country recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>It's just video clips. Maybe she narrates where they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> And... action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Looks like she didn't travel very far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You look beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>You look nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> I've never done this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>I have. Trust me. You'll love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>As long as we don't know what's wrong, we don't know what's relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I'm gonna search her bathroom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Can't really say "yes" when it's a hallucination asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Don't worry, you're just dreaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What symptom did I see in you? A myoclonic jerk...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>An incredibly rare neurological symptom is boring? Am I in someone else's subconscious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> What did we do last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Was I meeting you for a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Is that all it was? A man thinks a woman is beautiful, admires her intelligence, admires the way she has to get whatever she wants, the things he likes about himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> Maybe she always had a little thing for him. His mind. His blue eyes. But someone gets between them. So, they decide to meet one night at an out-of-the-way little bar. Does that sound familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Do I feel familiar? What do you feel?  Electricity.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Electricity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I know I saw the symptom. I know the memory's locked in my brain. Now I know how to get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> You don't even know what I'm talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You need to rest. I have yet to hear about any study linking electricity and rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Deep brain stimulation. It's been proven. Electrical impulses applied directly to the hypothalamus could evoke detailed memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>My mistake, drilling a hole and shooting lightning bolts into an already-cracked skull is very restful, it's not fatal at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> She's right. You need to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Brain activity spiked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Amber. Amber. It's me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Random spikes are common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> It's gonna be okay. I'm here with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The team has found something. Can you ask her if we can be excused?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Coronary angio was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>So was the tox screen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>That's what you found? Negative tests? I could have told you she doesn't do drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> We found these in her apartment.  Sorry. Prescription diet pills. SSRIs, amphetamines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Diet pills cause structural damage to the mitral valve, could explain the tachycardia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Sh-she'd have to be an addict to take enough for it to damage her heart. I'd know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you know that she was hiding them in her vitamins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>We have to warm her back up. Get her heart beating so we can do a CT to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>No, we've been over this. Starting her heart could cause brain damage, could burn out the heart muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Test her heart without starting it. Crack her chest open, reach a finger inside the pulmonary vein, run it across the valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>That's the safer course?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It is if we're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>When did we start assuming we're wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>If this were any other patient...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If the valve is calcified, that's our answer. That's our cure. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>"Thirteen". Who found the diet pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You didn't even go in the bathroom, did you? You're suddenly mute in the differentials. A blow-up doll would be more useful. And yes, that's the first time I've ever implied something negative about a blow-up doll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Normally, I'd be fascinated. Today, don't care. Get over whatever it is and do your job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Wait. Look at her eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>She's jaundiced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Her liver's not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Diet pills don't kill the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Put her back in ICU.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Liver failure means whatever this thing is, it's spreading, despite the fact that she's frozen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>We can stick a needle in her liver. If we see fibrosis, she's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Does Amber drink sherry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>And the cardio fits just as well. But there's no way we can tell, since we can't take her temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I had a dream. She was pouring me a glass. And since I'm a scotch-, beer-, gin-, and rum-man...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> If we warm her back up, we should be able to tell if she's got an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Yes, we can get a diagnosis by letting the disease run rampant until it kills her. If it's spreading, we need to slow this even more. We've gotta cool her down further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>I know you love her and, uh, you're scared she's gonna die. But just making her colder and colder isn't a cure. It's not dealing with the reality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Sherry means something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Amber doesn't even drink sherry. House. Can we get back...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If she did drink sherry, it would mean nothing. Since she doesn't, my subconscious is obviously trying to make some other point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>There's a Sharrie's Bar on Third right off the bus route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>FLASHBACK</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Wilson's right. We need to make her colder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Putting more ice on her is just delaying the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Not on, in. Fill in her lungs with slurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Taking Wilson out for a drink.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you see me here with a-a tall blonde woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Yeah, I think she joined you after scotch number seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Did she seem sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>She sneezed. I gave her a napkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you see the color of the sputum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>I assume sputum means snot. Look, I see a lot of drunk chicks in here. I didn't have time to stop and analyze the color of your girlfriend's boogers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> She's not my girlfriend, genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>She was hot, you seemed into her, and she bought you drinks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Ooh. Not that one. The slurry tube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> I know this is different. But it's not. Everyone dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>You're reacting this way because she might be... soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I'm an Indian guy named "Kutner". Ever wonder what happened to my parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I was six years old. I used to like helping out in my parents' store after school. Guy walks in to rob the place.
