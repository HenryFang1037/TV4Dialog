<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Mom! I’m thirsty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>I just gave you water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I want juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>It’s bedtime. Close your eyes and go to sleep. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Mom! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>What do you want, Clance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Oh. Hi, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Can I turn the TV on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>TV is only for the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I’ll keep the volume down; I just like the light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Dad, what if…  what if they come to get me again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Nobody is coming to get you, okay? Go to bed, now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Come on Clancy, it’s time to get up.  I guess he’s already up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Well, that’s a first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I’ll, uh, I’ll see if he needs breakfast. Hey, Clance, you hungry?  Hon, he’s not down here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>You sure? Clancy? Clancy? Clancy! Where are you? Sweetie, are you hiding? </content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ah. Where’s the sweat and the B.O? You’ve taken such pride bathing us in your personal musk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Showered at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And yet you’re earlier than usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is this an intervention? It’s a little late, since I’m not using drugs anymore. I am, however, still hooked on phonics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you still did your morning run and showered at home you’d be later than usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought of you in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How’s your leg? You seem to be favoring your left side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’ve taken the stairs every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do I need a restraining order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken, and your leg will hurt again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or maybe we’ve made him depressed because we’re lying to him. Telling him he got that case wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We didn’t hurt him. The pain isn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He gets depressed, he stops exercising. He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies. The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe he stops exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane, popping Vicodin again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can’t tell him. He got lucky; there was no medical –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He was right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We tell him he was right, and we’re feeding his addiction. Without Vicodin, he’s only got one to focus on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, he’s not going to OD on puzzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, it’s not going to hurt HIM. But he could just as easily have killed that patient. We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change and, based on that limp, the window’s closing fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He ever get his feelings hurt? I’ll need to know that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You are 0 for 1 since you came back. You just want to make sure –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasy is most likely sexual abuse. Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe we should talk to the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why, in case he’s telling the truth? You’re a believer, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, I’m just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we’re the only ones with life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But I’m guessing we’re the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfect. Especially if there were neurological problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What part of “hallucinating an alien abduction” isn’t neurological?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, why is that a hallucination?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What? You think the kid –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s having nightmares. Nightmares aren’t a symptom of anything, other than wanting to sleep with Mommy. Which just leaves us with one symptom: the bloody tuchas, which can easily be explained by a GI problem or a bleeding disorder. Check his coags with PT, PTT, and bleeding time. And prep him for endoscopies from above and below.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’re going to make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay? And we’re going to time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding. Now, this is going to sting a little, so you might want to look the other way. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Are those windows locked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Those windows don’t even open, they’re just here to let sunshine in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Good, ‘cause they know I’m here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Clancy, don’t bother the doctor with this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. How do they know you’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me. I can feel it back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>There is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Let me see. Lean forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>And they have this other thing, and they put it in between these two ribs, always on this side, and then they move it around my insides. It hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You know what, Clancy? I think I might have found the chip back there. And I think I might be able to get it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mm hmm.  Okay, lean forwards. Now hold very still, okay?  Got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I’m seven, not three. All you did was pinch my neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His alien abduction story… the level of detail is... I don’t know where he gets it from. The parents say he doesn’t watch sci-fi, he doesn’t read comic books –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it’s a simple bleeding disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it’s a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I didn’t screw up the test!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it’s a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice. Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case. If you screwed up, I don’t have to cry myself to sleep. It’s a simple bleeding disorder. Foreman, redo the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe you were abducted; lost time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kid’s got a bleeding disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you’re saying Chase did screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or Foreman screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got them mixed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, snap! Foreman’s playing the dozens; you’re at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So we have contradicting bleeding time tests. If we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which one’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor’s incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hey, Foreman. Your momma’s so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she’s backing up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Where’s Clancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>He’s asleep, he’s –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House! Clancy’s gone missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, no! Well, you take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint. Let’s pray he hasn’t gone into hyperdrive! We’ll never catch him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Clancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I had to go where there was no windows, so I could get the chip out, like you said!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I can feel it, I just can’t grab it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Clancy, stop! There is no chip! We’re going to clean you up, and we’re going to go back to your room. You can’t do things like this. Your parents… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not even be terrestrial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you idiot! It’s titanium. Like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago, nice medical history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That pin was removed six months after –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what, a little piece broke off during removal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Titanium is used to build nuclear subs, pieces don’t just break off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Body attacks any foreign object. Inflammatory reaction could have eroded into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. An alien chip makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn’t actually screw up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. I tripped. Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck, apparently didn’t bleed to death. Now that’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He clotted on his own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there’s not again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which is impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>So you’re just going to keep cutting him, until what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This test is different. We’ll draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>But why haven’t the other tests –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ve had three results that haven’t been consistent. One of them must be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or two of them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Is it possible the problem isn’t his blood? It’s just psychological? I mean, he almost killed himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He wasn’t trying to hurt himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>No, he was just looking for an alien tracking device.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I have time for one more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>I don’t blame you for spending extra time down here. Heard the Artist-Formerly-Known-as-Gimp is back upstairs.  Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s busy, I’ll take it.  Oh, my God! You’re, uh, you’re okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Have we met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was one of your doctors. You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Addison’s disease. All I needed was cortisol, and my brain turned on like a switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This is amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Surprised you didn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How would I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Not quite my old self yet. Baby steps, the doctors tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>With rehab you’ll do great. What hospital did you go to? How would I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>I want to have sex with my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>And I was hoping that maybe you could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Viagra. You’re here for Viagra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>A bucketful would be nice.  Dr. Cuddy! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s completely unethical!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He was reckless with a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He was right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But he didn’t know that. He needs at least some glimmer of humility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why does he need that? Because other people have that? Why does he need to be like other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He needs to be less reckless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Well, you did it. He’s dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions, he’s in pain…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How much pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why? You know this is affecting him, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Telling him that he got his last case right won’t do anything to help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’ll make him less depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Which might not help his leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But you don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it’s sensing pain. If it is, the ketamine isn’t working anymore and he’s headed for a huge crash. If it’s not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Too tight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>My parents think I’m crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, they don’t. They’re just worried about you, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>I’m not weird! It’s just that weird things keep happening to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Slight pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don’t think they’re going to be bothering you for much longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>You lying again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. We figure this out, and everything’s going to be okay.  Still with us?  Pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wait outside! Get him oxygen and start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside. Get them outside!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don’t risk hypoperfusing his organs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m open to suggestions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Solve the case. Kidneys could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidneys are clean. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Tell me he’s a mutant human hybrid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It is a bleeding disorder. Clancy tested positive for von Willenbrand’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I didn’t screw up. How could he clot on his own two out of three times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe he cheated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I meant, he’s clotting right now and he’s in hypertensive crisis. Maybe the two are related. What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand’s could theoretically clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And the first time Clancy clotted he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction; he could have easily have been hypertensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sounds like a cheat to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, we get it. Okay, what’s the differential for a seven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We think the problem is in your son’s heart. We need to do a procedure called a transesophageal echo.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That will tell us where the problem is. Hopefully. Then we can fix him. Listen, this isn’t really part of my job, but… he’s worried that you think he’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Well, isn’t he?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right there. Left side, no movement.  Well, don’t freeze it! Something’s not moving, how do you see something not move if nothing’s moving?  I need the laser pointer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not an arrhythmia, that’s a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren’t moving at all. Go get me those myocytes; I want to talk to them in my office.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Heart nearly exploded. Still beating, though. Most of it, anyway. Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, “Yes, I am 18”? Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>-- Then the pain can be good. It could be muscle regenerating. After you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn’t mean the ketamine failed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I’m not! Oh, you got me. If I thought my leg was deteriorating, don’t you think I’d want to take steps to prevent that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Okay. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is impossible. Run it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We already did. And once more after that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The genes from Clancy’s myocytes don’t match the genes from the rest of his body.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are ways DNA could become mutated. Extreme UV radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That much sun, he’d be dying with a healthy bronze glow.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-39"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-40"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who cares what caused it? A kid comes in with strep, we don’t conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from; we cure it. We know he’s got this stuff inside of him; let’s get a scalpel and cut it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-41"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where do we cut? Chances are it’s not just in his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, we got lucky with the heart. Myocytes contract, we can see that these weren’t working. I don’t know how the hell we’re going to find it anywhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-43"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What if we find the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-45"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s the same way we search for cancer. The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells. We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein and we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-46"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, let’s do that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course he’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We need another plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don’t talk about it that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Plan. Sounds like we’re conspiring against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m going to tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Makes a lot of noise and it’s going to help us figure out what’s wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think House has lost his step?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s fine. There – clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur. Explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>‘Cause I don’t need to subject myself to House’s torture if there’s no upside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m telling you, he’s fine. We missed some affected areas in his heart, explains the continuing hypertensive issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You said the last case really threw him, and now suddenly–</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you changed your mind? Why? His brilliant ideas in this case have all been yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s the reason for him needing glasses, apparently it’s a symptom. Means the condition predates –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don’t change your mind without a reason. What do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House didn’t blow the last case. Cuddy cured the guy using House’s idea. Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility. Scan is complete. 3 hot spots but nothing in his brain. House’s original theory was right – it is not neurological.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Is he going to be able to walk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His leg should be functional after some rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Functional? What does that mean, he’ll be able to walk, but not run? He’ll have a limp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If everything goes well he’ll walk, he’ll run; he’ll probably be even stronger than he is now. When we close him up, we’ll move over to his other leg, snake a catheter up through the femoral artery, and into his heart.  Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will step back in and do its job. He should have no more problems with his blood pressure. After confirming those areas are clear, we’ll start our final procedure. We’re going to insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Close your right eye. Can you see my face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Yeah! It’s clear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can throw away your glasses. We got it all. Get some sleep, you’re going home tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Clancy</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I want you to run. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When did you become an enabler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m enabling you to exercise. Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’d rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re just like any other patient – running away from knowledge that won’t make you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m as happy as a pig in poop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re scared the ketamine treatment’s wearing off. That it was just a tortuous window of the good life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What part of poop didn’t you understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How can you be so sure it isn’t just a sore muscle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s my leg. We’ve known each other a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re not always right, House. You’ve proven that lately.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Obviously we missed some foreign tissue. There’s something still in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe. Sorry, House, it is neurological. Looks like you’re wrong, again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We didn’t miss anything. Brain scan was completely clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don’t use an IV this time; get it right into the brain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His scan was clean, twice! It’s not there! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if it is there but didn’t show up on the scan? What if the tag just doesn’t work in his brain? Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So how are we going to find it? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Make sure his blood pressure’s stabilized and send him home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Like nothing ever happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We don’t know that we fixed anything, it’s only been a day. Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He had a convulsion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>May be epilepsy, may be psychological, may be nothing. If the kid gets sick again it’ll give us another clue, we can start searching again. If he doesn’t, it doesn’t matter. Send him home.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except on my last case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don’t be pathetic. Just forget the last case. This kid obviously has something wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients? Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn’t sick, now you’re convinced this one is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This one is a young boy. His parents are desperate. Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That’s where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you have reason to believe that that might help –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not going to start lopping off body parts, but it’s interesting that you’d give me the green light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I just want you to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’ve been overly supportive this entire week. Either you’re hormonal or you’re guilt-ridden. And it’s too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then what did you do wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He had Addison’s, your last patient. You were right. I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something. Back when he was really young, I mean really young, I mean twelve cells young. In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop.  So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money’s worth. Problem is, there’s not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there’s no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They never untangle. He’s two people in one. It’s called chimerism.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son’s brain that makes him believe that he’s being abducted.

<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing that your body language isn’t telling me right now. So, what was the plan? That I’d feel so humble by missing a case that I’d reevaluate my entire life, question nature, truth, and goodness and become Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Something like that. More that if we told you the truth; that you’d solved the case based on absolutely no medical proof, that you’d think you were God. And I was worried your wings would melt.</content></utterance>
