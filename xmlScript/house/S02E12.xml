<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Been looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If they could handle it, they wouldn't be asking for you.  Is that a Journal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Friend wrote an article.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In Hindi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in India. Says so right on the cover  Kid's heart rate's a mess. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume the burn unit knew that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His potassium's low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which can also be explained by the burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be amphetamines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a bacteria lunching on his heart; or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is he even going to survive the burn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What have you got a date or something?  40% of his body, if the burns unit can prevent an infection, his body will regenerate maybe 10%, surgeons will do 20 or so grafts, 6 months in this room he'll end up with a series of nasty scars, maybe some pain but he'll live.  Unless his heart shuts down because we can't figure out what's causing the low potassium and tachycardia. We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>While he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where do we get one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What lecture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Dr. Weber's lecture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who is Dr. Weber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>A neurologist, I think. The memo was from you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Did you issue this memo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Congratulations, the patient that has been in a coma for 2 years and counting is still in a coma. This is not my signature; I don't know anything about this guy. I'm supposed to introduce him, have lunch?  The coma patient has a migraine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prevent a migraine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's a migraine, increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You induced a migraine headache in a coma patient?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Have you even read an ethical guideline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well if you are to try out a new migraine prevention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you sign this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Errr... yeah.  We can talk later about the appropriate discipline. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because of the burn, we can't perform any of our normal tests to see what's wrong, so we're going to try a galvanometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It picks up a pulse in the wrists and the ankles. Hopefully it'll tell us whether his heart rhythm is abnormal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>What have I done to him? I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>It was an accident! So... he's got all these burns and err... and now there's something wrong with his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're trying to figure out if the two were somehow connected. Had he been sick lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> No, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Anything unusual with his behavior, had he been tired a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>He was great, he was happy, he was just having a great time and then...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If he was experimenting with amphetamines or cocaine..?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No. We gave him some pot about a year ago to try--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>It was just once. We thought if we took the mystery out of drugs and alcohol, the less he'd experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We'll know more after the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>It looks like they're going to electrocute him </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Plug it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You plug it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine, give me the cord.  Works. Prominent U waves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And a bit of T wave. No ischemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Q wave normal.  That's not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase! Turn it off! Turn it off!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Who electrocuted my patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He wasn't electrocuted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What does the seizure tell us?  Move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment.  Differential diagnosis, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be epilepsy or seizure disorder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not with the tachycardia. It could be a virus in his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your specificity is impressive. Adrenoleukodystrophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be MS, seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well let's find out which, get an MRI. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No nuclear imaging.  He wouldn't survive the move to radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Can't do a lumbar puncture either. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We'd be inserting a needle into an area that's teeming with bacteria. If he doesn't have a brain infection already, we'd give him one for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's no other way to look at a brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Transcranial doppler sonography.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She said brain, not pregnant woman's uterus. They do sound alike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I used one to look at a brain this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why didn't you take the patient to radiology, get an MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not going to get a diagnosis of MS from a sonogram!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not definitively, but patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex.  Ok then.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you for all coming to today's lecture by Dr. Phillip Weber. Who is our guest today at our hospital to talk about...  Headaches. Dr. Weber is at the Weber Center for Pain. That makes sense.  Weber, Weber. Erm, so please welcome Dr. Weber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Thank you Dr...  Cuddy.  I suppose I should tell you err... a little bit more about myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>I went to school in Virginia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You've never been to one of these things in your life, who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's with the outfit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sudden chills, and light sensitivity. Inexplicable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>I received my medical degree at Johns Hopkins University, where I studied under Brightman and Gilmar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Hmm! He must be good. You went to Hopkins and studied under Brightman and Gilmar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shhh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>This helped me to win the Doyle internship at the Mayo Clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You were supposed to get the Doyle internship.  This guy's von Lieberman?! The guy got you thrown out for cheating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The Dean threw me out. Von Lieberman just ratted on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This guy's name is Weber, not von Lieberman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I call him Weber von Lieberman. Way eviler. Shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>--and the receptors have improved the acute treatment of migraines. To this point, the prevention of-- </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So what's the plan? You going to wait 'til he bends over then make a fart sound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well you cheated off him, how bad can he be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He got the answer wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Are they trying to wake him up? They can't do that, right? He'd be in too much pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Don't worry, he's still under, but the brain never completely sleeps, it's always working; controlling your heart rate, breathing, temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The eyes respond to visual stimuli, blood flow increases in certain areas in the brain and we can track that with the sonogram. With MS, blood vessels are more reactive so flow is faster. If Adam has an infection, they'd be swelling which would constrict the arteries, and the flow would be slower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Chase. Near the subarachnoid space. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content> Data from control subjects were analyzed in a two-way ANOVA with status and side as within subject factors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uhh... you stalked this guy for 20 years just for this shot to humiliate him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shh! I'm trying to learn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>--vessels without significant rebound. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He doesn't even know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're going to interrupt him, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I have a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And what's that going to accomplish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have got to find less debilitating outlets than humiliating people! I... hear bowling is more fun than stalking.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We found a subarachnoid bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It could be. 10% would damage the cerebral cortex and have seizure.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>You know if my lecture is interrupting your meeting I can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bahut shukriya .  As your people say in India, 'preciate it.  We'll figure out why later. And fix the bleed or he dies. Talk to you in a couple of hours  Teri maa ki  </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Look when I get there! I'm flying blind without a contrast CT here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>And with a P value of less than point zero zero one, we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prevents migraine headaches without daily administration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Err... excuse me doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> He knows his field better than you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prevent a migraine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>That's why they call it a breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>No, the... err pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure your wife and lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And how exactly did these studies work? You give this drug to a bunch of people and if they don't get a migraine you go "voila, my drug works"?  Erm, excuse me miss, uh do you have cancer?  Wow!  Mango juice prevents cancer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Uh, perhaps I should have taken my medication before this lecture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>We had a very specific control group. Chronic migraine sufferers, I don't have time to go through all the math right now but the incidence was dramatically--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-44"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Do I know you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know your math skills. They blow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-46"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Touché.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>You sound very familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-48"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in India? Why not publish it in really, really cool head cases of South Philly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-49"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Neuroscience New Delhi is a respected journal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-50"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-51"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Get a hooker. Anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-52"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See I'm thinking that publishing studies is probably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach around. And choosing a journal that no one can actually read well that's... that's shrewd. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content> I know I know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure you do. Dick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-58"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-59"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Medical school was 20 years ago, give it a rest, grow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-60"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-61"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>You cheated!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-62"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-63"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Oh yes, you would like to believe that because it plays right in to your fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-64"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I tested it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-68"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> The coma patient? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-69"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>You haven't changed a bit. You took shortcuts in Med school, you're taking shortcuts now. You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-70"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-71"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Cerebral cortex atrophies in coma patients. You need live conscious people. You don't know everything, House.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. MS is complicated, I think this is more basic. It's just tachycardia and seizures. How much longer the burn unit guys gonna keep him in that thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Lecture's over, let's go. House wants to--  Adam's waking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Get the anesthesiologist in here now!</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It'll knock you out for a couple of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the patient had fun in the hyperbaric chamber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gotta schedule me some time in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Weber's meds aren't even legal in the US.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s legal in India. I was disoriented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Err… moving around is a bad idea. Hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know. Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing can hurt my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey you're going to feel some dizziness, definitely going to be constipated.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not stalling you, we just don't know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could pain medication cause an orgasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe pain caused the orgasm. You get a tattoo; the brain releases endorphins which create pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Most people don't orgasm from a needle prick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually Chase has a point; the brain is like a huge train station. If the switches get--  -- you're the neurologist, talk for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle, it's possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Infectious neuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Crab's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All very bad things. No way to look for any of them in his condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could be an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I said infection about 8 seconds ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You listed some brain infections, but what if it's just a regular old infection festering in the burned skin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pus on his arm isn't causing problems in the forebrain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's on 20 different medications to manage his pain and his heart, how often he urinates. His brain is like a waiter that’s got too many--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Heyy! I do the metaphors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> The brain is stressed. An infection's elsewhere could put it over the edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So we just wait for his burns to heal to see if you're right? If you're wrong, he doesn't have that kind of time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Dear New England Journal of Medicine, I took this guy's drug and still got a headache thus scientifically proving that my archenemy is an idiot. You just wanted the pain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You get distracted by pain, leaves less room for the things you don't want to think about, like the Flyers sucking or the price of gas or... ohh, the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our patient, he's depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He told you that when you woke him up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not diagnostic of depression. Lack of appetite, isolating yourself--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least a second seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but you know how much crap he's got in his system from dealing with those burns, the guy could have the Spanish Armada floating through his bloodstream and we wouldn't know about it. Until they started firing cannons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms. This is a brain in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is a brain with too much serotonin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it doesn't cause a brain to shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do. Every 10 million or so cases, sets off a chain reaction; produces too much, enough to fry itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If Adam has Serotonin Storm, it’s deadly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But treatable. Cyproheptadine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-30"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Unless he doesn't have Serotonin Storm, he could just as easily have too much dopamine as serotonin, but if it's dopamine the cyproheptadine will kill him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-43"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content> This wasn't my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well if he hadn't had the brain problem, he wouldn't have the burns. On the other hand, if you hadn't put him on the ATV, he also wouldn't have the burns. You can debate your personal responsibility after I leave. I need to wake him up again.

<utterance uid="22-56"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>He told us when he cheated on a math test; he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him! He doesn't hide anything from us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-57"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But if he was depressed...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-58"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>He'd tell us. We don't judge, he's not depressed, we're sure.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Don't touch our son, we told you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously, millions of bacteria, microbes on you. He'll die of sepsis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>I think he's going to wake him up again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know he is.  House! You can't do this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. Relax. Are they going to sue us? If I'm right, I save his life. If I'm wrong, he's dead no matter what I do. Either way, how much have I really hurt them? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Leave him alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're not sterile; do you want to kill the kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give me the syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No pain, no gain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey!  You gotta stop this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They're right, he's not depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah sure, I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's that on his wrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> A burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why on his wrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why not on his wrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His back, his torso, everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a perfect circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist, a screw from the ATV </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Why are you torturing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does your son smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>I'd kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So, he talks to you about sex, crack, anything except cigarettes. He has a cigarette burn on his wrist, also a fading nicotine stain between two fingers. Bad news, your son has a filthy, unhealthy habit. Good news, he's trying to quit. Bad news, the quitting is killing him. Good news, I can cure him. Bad news... nope, that's the end of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Quitting smoking can kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No-smoke meds are antidepressants. Crappy ones you can get over the internet are loaded with whatever antidepressants they can get cheap.  Since mommy and daddy obviously didn’t take him to a pediatrician. Sorry I was wrong about him being depressed.  Treat him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Hey, did you drop acid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>To annoy me, or maybe because you're miserable, or... because you... want to self-destruct. Pick one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks? I'm just saying that's also a possibility. How did you know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Cameron is worried about you. I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours; if you were functional she must be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Thank you for ruining my clinical trials. Pharmaceutical company is shutting me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're kidding, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently located--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>So what's next? You going to follow me my whole life? Torture me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>You waited 20 years to do this. What's next? Break up my marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. We're even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Weber</speaker><content>Right.  Oh thanks, for setting me up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants. Everything in balance.  Buddhists call it karma and Christians call it the golden rule, Jews call it...  I don't know. Rabbi Hillel said something poignant. Universe always settles the score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, but it should.</content></utterance>
