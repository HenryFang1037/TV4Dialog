<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content> Come on, honey. You're gonna throw him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>It's okay. I'm almost done. A little more light on your hips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content> Oh, God. Why couldn't you have come up with this before I had two kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content> You look amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Okay, I think… yeah, I'm done. Wanna come take a look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>I can’t. You first. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content>No, we'll look together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>I don't understand. I… I thought —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Honey. It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content>This is not what we discussed, or what I paid for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I don't understand. I think this is one of the best I've ever done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content>I want my money back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I'm sorry, but this is not some department store photo studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content> And this is not my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Yes, it is. You asked me to paint her exactly as she looks. That's exactly what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Honey! Oh, stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content> What's going on? Brandon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Anthony</speaker><content>That check… better be in my mailbox by Friday. Or I'll be back.  Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content> What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content> I don't know. They saw the painting and they just freaked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content> Brandon, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>What do you mean? It's her portrait.  What's wrong with it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>First column, last entry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Today is going to be a good day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh.  Hi. I'm Lucas Douglas, PI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This hospital's not putting a private investigator on retainer. Nor is it gonna pay any more phony repairs on vending machines, cryostats, or elevators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Information saves lives. Saving lives saves money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, saving lives costs money, which is why I'm trying to make sure there's still some left! You want your own personal PI, you're gonna have to pay for him yourself.  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, I understand. Hey, I… I like the shoes, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Uh… thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't like her shoes. You like her legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>It sounds less creepy if you say shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Less creepy, more gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>That's my firm's motto. What is a cryostat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No idea. Whoever fixed ours is about to get stiffed. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There's no distorted perspective in any of his other recent works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not much talent, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So the symptoms just came on. Acute onset visual agnosia points to a stroke or brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>MRI revealed no stroke or brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We should do another with contrast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If he's like the other struggling artists I've known, he's also into drugs. We should…  What are you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently, a moron. One, ER routinely tests for drugs. If it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file. Two, who pays 12% interest on a car loan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How did you —? Did you run a credit check on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. That would be illegal. Interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though…  What? It's part of my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your job is to diagnose patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which I do with the team. How am I supposed to know how best to utilize that team if I don't know everything about them? Say that Van Gogh turns out to have neurosyphilis, and our last vial of penicillin is in a storeroom at the end of a 20-mile hallway with a two-foot high ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You've discovered that one of us has been hiding the ability to stretch or shrink themselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I would never out someone's super powers.  This, on the other hand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You crawled 20 miles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>My name's in the Guinness book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll bet that really impresses the babes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I didn't do it to get the babes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. That would cheapen the purity of your achievement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sorry to interrupt, but we have a patient with a probable brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who needs an MRI with contrast, we've established that. What do you got on Taub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got nothing on Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could also be environmental. We should check his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taub's wife, on the other hand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House. That's enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dad's right. This is no time for gossip. A patient desperately needs our help. Check his head and his house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Can't Lucas —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Nope. He's very busy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If there is a tumor, this test will show us —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Is that stuff dangerous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This is just the contrast material. There is a small risk of an anaphylactic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I could stop breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't worry. We're prepared to deal with whatever happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>You know, I did some drawings this morning, and they seemed fine. So maybe it was just a reaction to something I ate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How many people you know have reactions like that to something they ate for breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>But if I'm getting better…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’ll continue to get better. If you're not, we need to know why not so we can start treatment immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>Baby, let them do the test.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Can lead poisoning cause visual agnosia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not without lead showing up in the blood work.  Nothing in the medicine cabinet except some harmless toiletries. No signs of mold or fungus anywhere, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You think House really got something on your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. Not that I'd care if he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Wait, your wife's doing the doorman in your bed, and they're sweating all over the sheets that you paid for and —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My wife's not doing the doorman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We don't have a doorman. And I just do, okay? Drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>In college, my friends and I came up with an inverse-square law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sounds like a real fun group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The girls who you think are the most inhibited… straight arrows… They're the ones you hook up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you saying my wife's a slut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I'm saying if my wife was a slut, I'd wanna know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>His place was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So is his head. Even with contrast, no masses, no lesions. A neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Time course means we can rule out cancer and MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just leaves toxins or drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You called Thirteen a moron for thinking it was drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. When she said it, she had other options. And I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A cavernous angioma in the brain could leak. Once the blood gets reabsorbed, the pressure goes down, the symptom goes away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He'll never consent to petrosal vein sampling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He was nervous about an injection of contrast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is his girlfriend hot? I'm not talking fever here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Very… and if he dies, it's good news for all of us, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That explains why all his paintings suck. And what's wrong with him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You seem to have a massive brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> He's Dr. House. He's pleased to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open. It's risky, but it's the only way to save your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wrong answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I'm not allowed to say no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're not allowed to not be terrified. There's only two good reasons not to be terrified in a hospital. You're delusional. But then you're not afraid of contrast material either. Or you know you're fine. Since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information that we don't have. What drugs are you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His drug tests were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful. She's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie. He needed money.  There's not many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence. And I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia.  He's a guinea pig. Companies pay him to test their untested drugs.  Did hottie go for a pee or coffee? Either way, I don't think we should waste any time on denials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>The clinical trials were supposed to be safe. The drugs are about to be approved by the FDA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Drugs? How many trials are you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Admirable. Not many idiots have that much ambition. You've been symptom-free since your admission, so whatever you took has probably cleared your system now. You'll be fine.  Keep him overnight, just to make sure, and get the names of all the trials he's been in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>You gonna tell Heather?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Couldn't, even if I cared enough to want to.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not bad. You almost made it the whole day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What'd you find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The point is to see how everyone reacts. Let me go get the rest of the gang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cut the crap, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your wife has a separate bank account in her name only. She's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now. No withdrawals… yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's it? A bank account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A secret bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What makes you think it's a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because if it wasn't, you'd call it "the" bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Damn. Always forget to use the right article when lying. It's not secret. We're refurnishing. We set the budget, set up an account. I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're spending almost $100,000 on furniture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't know. He was fine, then all of a sudden, he started seizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>He said you told him he was better. What's happening? What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She is hot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It’s like the mod squad. No one could stop them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate. But people won't test drugs unless they're desperate. We need drugs to save children and puppies. Ergo, we need desperate people. Ergo, welfare kills sick children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>First drug —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't we call it bisexidrine?  Clinical trials involve experimental drugs. Means they don't have comforting, catchy names yet. Just random, unmemorable trial numbers.  Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant. Phase one indicated some risk of nausea, ED and insomnia. Second drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuckoldisol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She is having an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shocking. Discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Drug B is an autoimmune treatment. Almost no side effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But even if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing, it doesn't mix well with anticoagulants or anticonvulsives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Which is the third drug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Worldssorestkneesisil.  Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to. If they're not, two million.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the problem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If we don't know which —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Rapid detox risks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Dialysis. Use that for kidney failure, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't worry. Your kidneys are fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's not worried about his kidneys. He's worried about how he's going to explain the dialysis to his girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I just don't want her to worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You mean you don't want her to leave you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>What's wrong with that? I love her. It's not like I've lied to her about anything important. I am an artist. I've sold plenty of paintings in the past. It's just… I've hit a bit of a dry spell lately, is all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So tell her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He can't. He wants her to be happy too. He's telling her what she wants to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You didn't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's not sleeping around. She's not gambling it away. She hasn't even spent any of it. So I don't see a reason to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't think a conversation might —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How many people do you know in completely happy and fulfilled relationships?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I am. Most people cling to some storybook notion of what a relationship is. You can't have an imperfect thought. You can't have a private zone. You can't —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Steal money and hide it away in a secret account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She makes me happy. I make her happy. It works. Because we don't do storybook. And I don't plan to poke into her business.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You were right about the dialysis. He made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office. The only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people. Which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Did you just hear what I said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I heard the part about “you can screw with me at work all you want.”Want my advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said this is not advice. You are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence. If it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him. If it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis. Which means we have to find a better way to detox him. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You'd spy on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No. No. Not spying. More like research. I think it's a good idea to get to know a little bit more about a woman before you ask her out.  Show you care about more than just what she looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As romantic as you make that sound, I'm pretty sure that what you're doing is… not so much caring as creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>That's not fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You were scrounging through my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>What the hell am I gonna find out? You went to Michigan. You like your sandwiches a little light on mayo. You stay in touch with your mother. You rented the English Patient and you gave money to Amnesty International. There's not one thing I can find out in here that you wouldn't tell a coworker while riding in an elevator.  I'm not a creep. I just thought you seemed interesting.  I'll go now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, no need for a date. You'd be employing me, so I'd have all the time in the world to ask you all about you, and it would fall under the category of socializing instead of creepy stalking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I'd be paying you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I know it's weird. But if you pay me while I check you out, it's — it's all cool. And you get value. You get leverage against him. Help you keep him in line.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You owe me an apology. Any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he saves a fortune on karaoke machines and deodorant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You think he's stable enough for surgery?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Yeah. Do you have any brothers and sisters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>One sister. He told me he was on the lacrosse team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>In high school. In college, he just cheered the lacrosse team on to victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Yeah. How’s your relationship with your dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. You have three more questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>How’s your relationship with your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>When did you lose your virginity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not something I'd discuss with coworkers in an elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>And… And… You know, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A bit of a wasted third question. 'Cause the answer is "know what?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Okay, bear with me here. Because some people sometimes consider my thought processes complicated. I'm into you, 'cause you're hot. And smart. In that order, but both are needed. Photos can be retouched. And House is an evil genius, which makes this photo suspicious. And yet you're not suspicious. Which means either you're not smart enough to be suspicious, in which case I am less interested in you, or you're not suspicious because you know this is actually a doctored photo of House, in which case I am more interested in you. But I am wasting my time because you know this is a game we are playing on you, and I am busted and I'm screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know the photo's a fake. And I know this is a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Too bad. Good-bye.  So you knew that I wasn't gonna give you anything worthwhile? An — and you were never gonna give me anything worthwhile. Then why did you bother coming out with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I… wanted to screw with House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>By wasting my time? That doesn't make sense. No, uh… There must be another reason. Hmmmm. Is it okay if I sit back down here?</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We believe it's necessary, but you need to know the ramifications. You'll never be able to feel angina. You may not know if you have a heart attack. You may not be able to get help in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Where are my regular doctors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Regular doctors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley. Why aren't they telling me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley. And this is Dr. Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>What are you talking about? I've never seen you before in my life.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We can't do the surgery. We're back to where we started. Visual agnosia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We need to reexamine neurological disorders. Something's slowly progressing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is. It's a new symptom, intermittence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's irrelevant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with Romano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe we missed something. Toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When? When you checked every bottle, every can, every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe there is a batch of toxic paint that he used up a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then he would have been sick months ago, not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's lost weight since he got here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>On his old paintings. We know he hasn't sold one in ages. But there weren't many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you're wrong, he could drop dead from Romano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just give me a few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I need to talk to him alone. It's about your work. Your paintings. I need to look at all the ones you've sold recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>Honey, can you give us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>To talk about your paintings? Brandon, please. Tell me what's going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I've only sold two paintings in the last… three years. Since we met. One was to my cousin. I've been making money enrolling in drug trials. Two, three at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>Why did you lie to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Brandon</speaker><content>I wanna be, uh… The way you look at me. The way it makes me feel. Uh, I wanna be… what you see… when you look at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>You think I'm that shallow? When I look at you… I see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So… Where are the ones you didn't sell?</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not the paint, it's the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's not on the drugs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months. They're normal April, June, and August. But they're distorted May, July, September.  Every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously. The statin was one month on, one month off. I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're hiding under the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>In the fat? That doesn't make sense. These drugs aren't fat soluble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not sure. I think —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Antacid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It makes sense. Also, I'm looking at the file.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh. Wake him up. We're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>No, no — he says he needs surgery, but not this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Did he give any specifics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Abdominal surgery to remove a… bezoar.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's like a hairball, but it's made up of undigested food. You can get it if your stomach acid's low, which Brandon’s was because of an experimental antacid.  Fruit and vegetable fibers and skins get stuck together and form a ball. It gets sticky, ferments, grows. It starts sucking up some of the pills he'd taken. Some are never heard from again. But some get released. For the last week, it's basically been giving him massive doses of all three at once.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shh. My gift, my rules. Bump.  All right, if you don't like the color apparently we can exchange it, but I'm hoping. You ready?  Ta-dahhhhh! Do you like it?  Baby, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>She didn't buy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn. So you didn't get anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Nothin'. We probably overstepped. You're really not the cheerleader type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, I figured she probably wouldn't figure me as the "photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper" type either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Heh. Yeah, about that. I took a little trip to your alma mater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You took a little trip 150 miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Online, by phone. I meant I did research.  That's a real photo, isn't it?  Wow, that is humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There was a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Even more so. That's too bad. You wanted her to see you in a different light, and… not only didn't she see it… She didn't even believe it was possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, people hate people who have theories about people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Lucase</speaker><content>You want me to back off?</content></utterance>
