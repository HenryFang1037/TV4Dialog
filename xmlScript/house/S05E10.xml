Think healthy and be healthy. You can start now. Just pick up the phone and become the best you you can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Cut! Going again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Sorry, did I mess up the commercial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>No, it's fine. Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Ah, I think it's cramps. Oh, I have burning on my side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Sit down, take a few minutes, and catch your breath. Everybody else keep running!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>We're not filming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>We don't do this for the cameras. We do it for ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Director</speaker><content> We can't go again with him sitting there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Fine, um, but that felt phony. At least let me get a little workout. Maybe if I’m breathing as hard as they are, I won't seem like such an evil task master.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>All right, take five, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content> How you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>I think I’m ready to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>You sure?  That's it. That's the way to fight through.  All right, concentrate on those knees. Lean into it. And lift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Lifting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Come on, push it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Lifting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Come on, you're almost at the top. Those eight steps are the difference between fat and thin. Seven, six, five, four! One more! Nice job!  You feel that burn? That's your body carving out its new shape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Don't sit. Just take it slow on the way down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Irv</speaker><content> Oh, boy.  Are you okay?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Any idea why we're getting half as many requests for you as usual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Democrats' health care plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>At least we have one case that looks intriguing. 30-year-old fitness trainer suddenly can't breathe. Collapses and breaks her ankle.  That's it? You're not gonna argue why this case is beneath you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You can't run away anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's just mean.  Why are we still together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We are going to our office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pronoun confusion. Starts kicking in once you pass child-bearing age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, that's just mean. My office was recently destroyed. I thought I’d use the office of the doctor directly responsible. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think the patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My desk won't fit in his cell. You can use our outer office.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where's Foreman and Thirteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Down in the GRC. Thirteen started her clinical trials today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What's Cuddy doing in your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> These walls aren't soundproof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm well aware.  Normal CT means that her lung problem has the distinction of having nothing to do with her lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Steroids. No one looks this fit without cheating. Anabolic steroids hack away at the immune system, left her open to a pulmonary infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wow. Muscles and curves. My penis is so confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She's not on steroids. Her program's all about getting in shape naturally — exercising, eating right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you know this because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She has infomercials to sell her DVDs. What? I'm up late a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you actually believe what you see on TV. Go run the labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> The labs are back. And there's no sign of steroid use. Can someone please read her file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can someone please stop backseat differentialating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What about allergies? She goes jogging every morning. Inhales car fumes during rush hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Perfect, except that she was jogging half a mile from the nearest road. In the cold. Cold air hits the lungs, sets off an attack. Exercise-induced asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice try. Except EIA doesn't account for the elevated BP, if you'd read the file.  Come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her BP's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Exercise-induced asthma actually fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. You know. She can't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The only good way to test for EIA is to recreate the conditions in which the attack occurred. But we can't exactly make her run out in the cold on a broken ankle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get creative. </content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Any shortness of breath? Tightness in your chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Feeling pretty good actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Not even breathing hard. O2 stats and lung capacity are still well within range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Your cuff's slipping down. You want to stop for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I'd rather not. Haven't had any exercise in two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Take it you don't get a lot of fat in your diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I take it from your tone you think that's a bad thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you ever indulge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Ha. There's more to life than indulging your every whim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I didn't say every. But a whim every now and then can make life a little —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You okay? Trouble breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content> No, I feel fine. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> No pulse. This isn't asthma.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There a lot of other people in the trial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm taking over the people that already started it at Mercy. So pretty full. Stop.  One more time. No talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I shouldn't be here. It's nepotism. I know the guy running the drug trials, so I get a spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have Huntington’s, so you get a spot. Stop. One more time. Just the fingers. No mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The point of this thing is to improve neural cell longevity. Which doesn't matter much before symptoms. So you should give my spot to someone —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Shut up. Stop. You can stop feeling guilty. Your best tapping rate was .004 taps per millisecond. Means your nerves have started degenerating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You wanna work in here? Fine. Me too. We'll split the desk, 50-50. That side's yours. This side's mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're right. There's plenty of space here. Neither one of us needs all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Huh? Did you say something? I couldn't hear you from all the way over here on my side of the desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Patient's heart stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We shocked her back to sinus rhythm. She's stable. Test didn't set it off. Her EKG was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, she's consistent. The lung problems had nothing to do with her lungs. A heart problem that has nothing to do with her heart. Something is strangling her system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Carcinoid tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Find it, cut it out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Can a leaking breast implant cause joint pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. And she clearly doesn't have implants. Or joint pain. What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Got another patient. I set up an online second opinion clinic. People who don't like or trust their doctors e-mail symptoms. I can knock off four or five cases over lunch. Clear two grand by e-mailing them back. Ascending colon's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's got to be illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Only in nine states, and this isn't one of them. Legal notice spells out it doesn't replace doctor's visits. So there's no opportunity for malpractice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How come you haven't said anything about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's no big secret. I guess I’m just not very chatty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You told us when you renewed your subscription to National Geographic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Small intestine looks clean. Moving into the pylorus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So you don't mind if I tell House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Actually House may sort of mind because I sort of set it up in House's name. Nothing in the bile duct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And by "set it up in his name," you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I mean it's Dr. Gregory House's second opinion clinic with medical advice direct from Dr. Gregory House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're insane. With two days to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House is never gonna find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He will if I tell him. Or you cut me in for 30% and I keep your secret safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's blackmail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes. Moving into the —  Whoa —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's her stomach?  It's the size of a shot glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Because our patient's a big, fat cheater.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Subtle. No way you geniuses could've spotted this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Gastric bypass surgery. She had her stomach stapled. Then had the records from her files pulled so it wouldn't ruin their DVD sales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Hold on a second.  Can you do this outside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here. Where are the smart guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you mean Foreman and Thirteen, apparently the first appointment of the drug trial's an all-day thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said yes to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Her gastric bypass procedure could cause —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget the bypass. Treat her like a fat girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Should we treat her like a 60-year-old Asian man too? She's not fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not on the outside. But on the inside, she's still tons of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>When she was obese, she probably had type two diabetes. Could've left her with permanent nerve damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ten points for doing what I said. Minus ten points for doing it badly. If this was diabetes-induced nerve damage, it would've kicked in years ago.  Have you seen my balls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Can you hold on a second? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My balls. Have you seen my balls? Giant one and the red one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your plan isn't gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course it is. I try to make you miserable to make you leave. You deny that it's making you miserable. You try to make me miserable so I’ll stop making you miserable. And eventually you will leave, citing reasons that have nothing to do with misery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You're not bothering me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Step one complete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I'm gonna call you from my cell.  And then I will come back in here.  Hey. Yeah, I just had to explain to him that I had his balls and he's not getting them back.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Sleep apnea explains —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apnea would've disappeared when she shrank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not if it destroyed the musculature of her trachea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain. The resulting neurological damage —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She been snoring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She didn't mention it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside. On the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Private area, House. It can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You need to consider side effects from her gastric bypass surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Forget the bypass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let the dying girl finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You said forget the —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Bypass could create malabsorption issues. Leads to low potassium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>But her intestines aren't. Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption by creating a blind loop of bowel. It ulcerates during exercise. Bacteria get loose in the bloodstream. Migrate to the heart and lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Very not stupid. Bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop. Get some and test it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He could've come up with SIBO anywhere else in the hospital. You didn't need to come down here and screw with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But her wrong idea led to his right one. It was vital screwing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We think your surgery might've caused an infection called SIBO. The stool test will help us to confirm. Put some of what you're full of in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>If surgery could somehow make you taller, wouldn't you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sure. But I wouldn't call a meeting of the Lollipop Guild and tell them they can grow if they work real hard at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I don't tell anyone not to get gastric bypass. I tell them how to get healthy. How to improve their lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, by telling them to do what you were unwilling to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I was willing to do anything. Thyroid, hormones, crash diets — none of it worked. My body was like a prison. When I got the surgery, I got healthy. And when I got healthy, I got happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not sure you're happy. But if you are, being healthy didn't do it. Being pretty did. Poop in the bedpan. </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House's office? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did he send you here to beg for it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, there are dozens of other doctors —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Other doctors actually use their offices for crazy stuff like seeing patients. Not throwing a ball against the wall and calling it work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's his process. That ball saves lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did he give you talking points?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, but I added one of my own. Don't take his office and pretend like all you're doing is taking his office. You chose his room because you want to be there. But sitting near him and hoping isn't gonna get it done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Leave here now, or I’ll take your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you won't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The boob lady e-mailed me again complaining of chronic fatigue now. She's convinced the implants are responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I told her. She says something is, and if I don't find out what she's gonna complain to the licensing board.  It's not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It is. You just can't appreciate it because it's gonna destroy your career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What happened? He call Foreman "clean and articulate" again? It is surprising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Clinic patients just whining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's the poop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's gonna take about an hour to spin down the sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You don't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm doing my famous Socrates impression. Think I really nailed the accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>High fat content indicates SIBO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And what does fat do in water? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It floats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What else floats in water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What about all that scar tissue around the implant? Could that be —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That amount of encapsulation's perfectly normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Well, I gotta tell her something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tell her to find a decent plastic surgeon who can correct the placement —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yeah, that's what she wants to hear, she's sick and she's lopsided.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tell her it's a virus. It probably is, and it'll get her off your back for a few —  Emmy’s EEG is flatlining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where would she have gone?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Hey, I looked for you guys in the control room, but you seemed busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Get off there. Last time you exercised, you had a cardiac incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You felt fine last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>I only slept a couple hours, but I feel great. Can I get one of those machines?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She said she needed to use the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Alpha waves on the EEG ruled it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide for good and valid reasons and must've spilled some on my side. Did it waft over to your side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cunning plan. You do realize it’s gonna stink for hours — on both sides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, would you look at the time? I hope your patient isn't still sick… Forcing you to stay here all night.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ascending numbness means her nerves are breaking down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We've gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Let me finish. I'll meet you down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were 15 minutes late yesterday. I don't want you to develop bad habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Appreciate the life lesson, but 15 minutes give or take isn't gonna make a difference. Get started on your other patients. I'll be down there when we're done here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way to know where your bread is buttered, sister.  Up high!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> If the problem's in her brain, it could be MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or early onset Parkinson’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But if it's her nerves, it could be transverse myelitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a million other things. We're gonna stay in the dark until we can figure out if her electrical problem is in her power station or in the high-tension wires.  Power station's the brain. Wires are the nerves. Go run an NCV test.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The test will measure the amount of time it'll take this electrical impulse to travel along your nerves.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. Give me your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>You can ask nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I learned at med school you don't actually cure with kindness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>You're right. I'm a hypocrite. But I don't have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not really interested in your rationalizations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>If I’m open about the gastric bypass, no one would listen to me anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You mean no one would buy your DVDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>It's not about the DVD sales. I'm helping people. My clients are making themselves healthy. They're living better lives. Can you honestly tell me you've never done anything hypocritical?  I'm sure you had good reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Give me your arm… please?  Keep your arm raised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Does this mean something is wrong with my nerves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. It's your muscles. We don't need to run this test. It's not what we thought.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She has muscle weakness. Could indicate myasthenia gravis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Also could be some kind of toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Excuse me, are you going up to the personnel floors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>DeeDee</speaker><content>I'm going to see Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you have an appointment with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>DeeDee</speaker><content>We've been e-mailing. Joint pain and fatigue thanks to these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I'm sure it's nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>DeeDee</speaker><content>Oh, and now this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He's actually downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, gone. Gone for the day. But, uh, we work for him. We can set you up in the ER. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The antibiotics will make her feel better. She's outta here by morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If it is a staph infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's gotta be. She has sleeves of tattoos and piercings from God knows where.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She has muscle weakness. Could indicate myasthenia gravis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had the weirdest dream. You guys did the test in a reasonable amount of time and came back here before I had time to fall asleep.  You guys still smell that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe you should just let her have your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or…  She sends one of yours to the hospital, send one of hers to the morgue. It's not myasthenia gravis. Her breathing's improving and the weakness is in her extremities.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could be a botulinum reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't think sabotaging your boss' office is a wise counterattack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All that is needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She probably used a lot of botox to tighten up her skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True.  Could also be any kind of heavy metal toxicity. PSP or arsenic from eating too much seafood. Cadmium from bad bottled water. Lead or nickel from canned fruits or natural grains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing: chelation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You never showed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Get out of my house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I wanted to find proof that you were slipping back into your self-destructive pattern. Confirm you weren't worth my time. Instead, I found this.  You followed all of my instructions to the letter. Probably better than any patient I have. So why are you the only one who can't show up for appointments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I came down right after I was finished with House. You were in your office with another patient. And there was another patient in the waiting room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm well-aware of what's gonna happen to my body over the next eight to ten years. I do not need a visual reminder every time I walk into that place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's understandable. It's human. And you need to get over it. Now you show up on time tomorrow, or you don't show up at all.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The chelation didn't work. Her muscles are still deteriorating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why aren't we doing this in your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy… overreacted to my overreaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Coronaro-cardiac fistula. Even a small hole could cause —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This started in the lungs, not the heart. And why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I'm sitting straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trouble in the land of false hope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everything is fine. Austrian syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice deflection. But our patient doesn't drink. She's a health nut. And even if I was a cynical guy and thought that she was a liar, I'd have done a tox screen, which would've come back negative for alcohol. You should come to these gatherings more often. Keep you from looking like an idiot.  Are you making book, or did something else happen to our patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Personal. I'll put it on vibrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Guillain-Barré. Usually starts as a muscle pain patients compare to the pain of over-exercising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So who's paging you? Your wife? Does it worry you that she paged Kutner first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Guillain-Barré fits. Patient didn't notice the initial symptoms because it's no different than how she feels every day. Her muscle weakness is the precursor to full paralysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gastric bypass probably set it off. Oh, at what price beauty? Go start her on plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Right, a rare neurological disorder is far more likely than a cry for attention. I mean, nothing about this woman screams "look at me."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay, I’m gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cuddy wanted us to eliminate seven different things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bad idea to get into a power play with somebody who has the power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're fired. Just reinforcing your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Whatever personal drama you're playing out, you'd be a lot smarter to —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought you said she was sick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sick people don't spontaneously get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes, they do. It's called an immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sick people who are sick enough to make it to me don't spontaneously get better. Not as pithy, but yeah, technically more accurate. What's the last thing you gave her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I took her for an MRI looking for —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>MRIs detect. They don't treat. What did you give her after the MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I didn't give her anything. She got depressed at the lack of direction. We went to the cafeteria for some chocolate cake. Took her to her room, hung a banana bag, let her rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You gave her cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She asked for it. I figured —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Feeling crappy again? I brought your cure.  I'd give you an IV of this stuff, but the frosting tends to get stuck in the little tubes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Is this a joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not a joke. Not a lie. Not an attempt to defraud in any way. It's an actual licensed physician with an actual diagnosis. Hereditary coproporphyria.  Your face is genetically blessed. Your body chemistry is slightly less so.  Doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme that I can't pronounce, but it's apparently important for your liver and everything else. Treatment is a high carb diet rich in sugar. When you were a porker, you were self-medicating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>So this is treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We just have to reverse your gastric bypass and get you back on a high carb, glucose-enriched diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The best you you could be is a lot more you.  Open the hangar. Here comes the plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>There's nothing else you can try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. There's a drug that manages the symptoms, but it's not a cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Emmy</speaker><content>Let's try that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You don't want to have the surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Understand. There's not many people who have the guts to admit they'd rather be pretty than healthy. The income's better and you get more action. I'll start you on your drug treatment right away. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I bought it. I bought that it was really about trying to make people's lives a little better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You're surprised she's superficial? You're a plastic surgeon. This is the human condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, she's a freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Every time you put someone under to bob their nose, you were risking their life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No singing. She's better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No one was supposed to let my patient leave her bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>She had a respiratory arrest. We coded her nearly 20 minutes, but she didn't make it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House is an unemotional child incapable of intimacy or romance. Trust me, it's done.  It’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I like the desk. Lot of character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's not the one I ordered.  This is my desk from med school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have it in storage or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My mom did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That was sweet of her to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She didn't. My mom has no idea I’m redoing my office. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I lied to you the other night. That woman in the waiting room, she didn't freak me out about my future. She freaked me out about my past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your mother. Must've been horrible watching her die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I wanted her to die. She just… yelled so much. And for no reason. Just screamed at me in front of my friends. My father tried to explain to me that her brain was literally shrinking, that she didn't mean it. That it was the disease, but I didn't care. I hated her. I never said good-bye. And she died with me hating her.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Did Chase test for the biliary tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Said it was negative. Said she was stable when he left her. Should've found more time. We should've —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House is gonna kill us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Slowly.  And painfully. You're not only idiots, you're frauds. Fraudulent idiots. Fraudulent idiotic killers, as it turns out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House, this was really my —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your fault? Yeah! For pretending to be me when you're not even competent.  And your fault for not ratting him out while the patient was still alive. What she had was easily treatable. She could've been fine. Damn treatment's so simple.  Might still be possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House…  House, she's clearly dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wasn't dead. She wasn't even sick, you moron.  Seriously, how good was she? No formal training. At least not in acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>DeeDee</speaker><content>Did you see their faces?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So the CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was from a patient three years ago. It was hard to find. But the hair and make-up, getting Chase and Cameron to play along, much easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We deserved it. I'll take down the website before —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take it down? Are you kidding? It's way too lucrative to shut it down. For Chase, for me. I earn 50% for letting you use my name. Chop chop. Go to work. First dollars go to expenses. I booked our little thespian here for two full days. That's three G's I owe her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>DeeDee</speaker><content>And you still got 3 hours left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do I?</content></utterance>
