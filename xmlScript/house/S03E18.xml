<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Fran? I'm Robin.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Cute home. Two bedroom, one bath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Guy I know collects those. Says they're worth a fortune on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> You've never used our agency before, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>Is it that obvious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> As you can see, we offer a full range of services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Round the world?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Our deluxe package. Offers all the services of A, B and C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>How much?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> I'll get ready.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>Harrington?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Harrington. What're you doing up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>All right, now don't take this personal, but you're gonna have to go...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Fran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Is this okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Fran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Fran? Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Fran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Yeah, I-I need an ambulance at 500 North Sycamore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> I don't know. My... friend collapsed.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>And what were you doing when you fainted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> We were just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>... looking for her cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Have you banged your head recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Is this a motion-sickness patch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> I must have forgotten to take it off. I just got back from a trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Oops. Scopolamine can cause dizziness and blurred vision.  You probably hit your head when you fell and that caused the blackout.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>I thought those patches were supposed to prevent you from getting sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Every drug has a side-effect. But it might be a good idea to keep your eye on her for the next few hours. Make sure she's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Oh, uh, actually... I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>She has to get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Is it important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>We just don't like people to be alone after they leave here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>I'm fine. Really, I'm... I'm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Fran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Fran!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I got a seizure! Code cart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>What's wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Where's House?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Antique vintner's cane. Cost me nine hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It had a corkscrew in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ah! That explains the vintner's reference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It could be used as a weapon against the pilot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Only if he's stuck in a bottle of Zinfandel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You'll get it back when we land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>NOISY GIRL</speaker><content>I want my blankie! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Give her twenty milligrams of antihistamine. Could save her life. 'Cause he she doesn't shut up, I'll kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Delivering goodwill to yet another continent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You only forced me to deliver a speech, not goodwill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> You gave a three-minute speech. You know how much WHO accreditation means to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Huh, may have been short, but it had girth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> And the room service thing was just spiteful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Three hundred dollars for a bottle of wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was thirsty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>A hundred and twenty dollars on video services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>That's five hundred in expenses I can't justify.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Don't worry, I'll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Welcome aboard.  Mr. House. You're right here in 2A.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Ms. Cuddy. You're in the next cabin and to the left. 9C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> No, I booked two first-class tickets. This must be a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> No mistake. Just arranged for a five hundred dollar fare reduction. Expense problem solved.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Where did you travel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>Duluth. To visit my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Really? Is this her artwork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> "Fire... butt"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> I was a little drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Where were you a little drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>I turned fifty-eight last March. Same age my mother was when she died. Next week I packed a bag and went to JFK. Looked at the big board, took the first plane that went to a warm place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Caracas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Did you drink the water? Eat salads? Any raw foods?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> And...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> I also did Mescal shooters and, uh, snorted cocaine from a homosexual man's stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Did you have sex? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content>No.  Not with him.  I had sex with El Gordo. He was a large man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>ROBIN</speaker><content> Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>FRAN</speaker><content> I never do things like that. I should have gone to visit my sister. It was stupid. It's why I'm sick, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Uhhh... it's... possible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>PENG</speaker><content>Uhhh, foof...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> Here you are. Rib-eye, medium rare. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Some more Pinot Grigio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Uh, no. Think I will switch to the... Syrah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Sir, are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> Nilalagnat ka ba? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>PENG</speaker><content> </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> Does anyone speak Korean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Is anyone a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'll go get her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you really think I was gonna leave you stuck back here for eighteen hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Go on, enjoy. With the Vicodin and the wine, I can sleep anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We should put her back on the Scopolamine patch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>She can't wear motion-sickness patches for the rest of her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>No, but if it does relieve her symptoms, it'll narrow down our search.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Ugh! Anything else you two guys won't agree on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Have a problem with us agreeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No, I have a problem with the other thing you guys are doing, which makes me question your motive for agreeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> I'll put her back on the patch. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It's gotta be something neurological. We should do a CT. Look for a brain tumour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It could also be an allergy or something environmental. We should check her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Bit more likely she got sick in Caracas than in New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Right. I forgot, there are no toxins in the US.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I think I'm starting to feel sorry for House.  Get a tox screen, chem 20, STD panel, blood cultures.  Then you run a CT.  And you check her house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wasn't supposed to be funny-ha-ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Fever, headache, severe abdominal pain, and a rash all over his lower back. It's serious. May be contagious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wow! We just attended a symposium on pandemics and you've run right into one on the flight home. Talk about a small world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>If it's meningococcus, half the passengers on this plane could get infected and die before we reach New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content> Is someone sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Someone has a hangover.  He had a snoot-load of Bloody Marys before dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Watch the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> That booze did not give him the rash. It is textbook meningococcus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It is also textbook allergic reaction to... pollen... peanuts, semen-stained polyester blanket he's lying on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Mr. Peng's throwing up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> We have to turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content> What? Why do we have to turn a...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> We don't! You misunderstood. Dr. Cuddy just meant that... he might feel less nauseous if he was facing a different direction. She didn't mean to panic a planeload of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> We're about to head over the North Pole. We don't turn back now, the next ER's fifteen hours away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He'll be fine.  I'm a doctor too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>You haven't examined him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Korean male, mid-thirties, 5' 9", one-sixty, bald, scar on the right side of his jaw, medic alert bracelet on his left wrist indicating that he is allergic to, at least, penicillin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Without any way to do an LP to rule out meningococcus, our only choice is to assume the worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good point.  On the other hand, I am a Board-certified specialist in infectious disease. She assigns parking spaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> Please let me know if he gets any worse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Think we should feed the cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Bowl's full. He wants it, he can get it.  Cadmium Yellow? Heavy metal poisoning would explain the ataxia and the seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Not unless she was painting with her tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Is Foreman right? Did you agree with me because of our relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You mean, because of our _lack_ of a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I mean, because we're having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Yes, Foreman's right. I thought you were completely wrong about the medicine, but agreed with you anyway because I figured that then you'd do me in some old lady's home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Then, well played.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>C'mon, we're supposed to be looking for toxins or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> We agreed it was a brain tumour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> He's watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Haven't you had anybody watch before?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content>Is that guy really sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No. He's all better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content>I don't believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Look that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>JOY</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>'Cause you're gonna throw up and I don't want it on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> I'll get some towels. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Give her a banana. Monkey see, monkey barf. You smell vomit...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, wasn't expecting that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I need help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Who doesn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Need someone to talk to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Can you say,  "Croikey, myte"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>AIR CHASE</speaker><content> Crikey, mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Perfect. Now, no matter what I say, you'll agree with me, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>AIR CHASE</speaker><content> O-kay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nicely done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You... disagree with everything I say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>AIR FOREMAN</speaker><content>Sorry. Not understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> That's close enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And you... get morally outraged with everything I say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>AIR CAMERON</speaker><content> That's permanent marker, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wow, you guys are good.  We are looking for the simplest way to explain these symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Organophosphate poisoning. Some international flights spray pesticides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>AIR CHASE</speaker><content> Uhh... could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>AIR FOREMAN</speaker><content>Sorry, English not so nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>AIR CAMERON</speaker><content>Is this a joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Just passed the half-way mark. Can't turn around. Nice call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No worries. _We_ think it's pesticide poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>We don't spray these flights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Dramamine overdose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Wouldn't explain the fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Jet lag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Wouldn't explain the abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Deep vein thrombosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Wouldn't explain the nausea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Food poisoning. What was on the menu?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content>Steak and sea bass in first class. Fettuccine and sea-food kebabs in economy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Since when does food-poisoning cause rash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Sea bass, seafood kebabs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He had the sea bass. Please tell me she had the kebabs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ciguatera poisoning. It's an instant onset toxin.  Symptoms include "E", all of the above. 'S only found in certain kinds of tropical gamefish, such as...? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>AIR CHASE</speaker><content>Sea bass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Make sure you get a rèsumé from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Helloo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>KEO</speaker><content> Excuse me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-39"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief announcement concerning your meals. IF you ate the sea bass or the seafood kebabs, you have ingested a dangerous toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-40"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> However, if you proceed to the restrooms both on your left or right or rear of the plane and vomit as soon as possible, the toxic effect should be minimal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-41"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Thank you and have a pleasant flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-42"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Meningococcus makes just as much sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-43"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What'd you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Nothing in her house. Big waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Medically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>CT was a complete waste. She was negative for tumours, her blood was negative for drugs, heavy metals, tropical diseases, food poisoning and STDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Also no sign of lead poisoning or sepsis. Apparently, Venezuelan tattoo parlours have standards after all.</content></utterance>
