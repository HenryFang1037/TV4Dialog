Take this log to your colleagues on the shore. It documents every piece of sick cargo. I'll throw them all overboard, but let me and my men come ashore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Doctor </speaker><content>I'll try to convince them. But stay anchored until you hear from me. Or the next shot won't be a warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Captain </speaker><content>They're never going to let us keep any of it. Toss the sick ones overboard. Then we're going to make a run for it. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Niles </speaker><content>I'm sure they're fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>They're gonna run out of air. I'm happy to kill my daughter, but I feel a little awkward about killing your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Niles </speaker><content>They're spending time together. It's good. We're a family now. They need to bond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>Yeah, well… they can bond with full air intake.  Julie, surface now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Help! Shark! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>Please don't scare me like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Roger </speaker><content>What? You said we should bond.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why aren't you guys in my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Why are you in the building? It's 8:00 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Where's Chase? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He's not here because it's 8:00 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>16-year-old girl — high fever, vomiting, bloodshot eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Wow. The case of the really bad flu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hmm, let me see. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yeah. The smallpox. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Smallpox was eradicated over 30 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So were Hush Puppies. Have you checked out your local hipster coffee shop lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Smallpox doesn't exist outside of P4 Labs and bio weapon plants. She was in Bermuda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Where she was scuba diving on the wreck of a Dutch slave ship, that had been intentionally sunk, because an epidemic of smallpox had broken out on board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Was the ship sunk in water? Because viruses can't survive contact with water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If the virus had been kept on the outside of an airtight jar, that might be an issue. The jar held old-school inoculations. They kept the scabs of the infected people. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>The virus can't survive over 200 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You have.  Thanks for calling back. Uh, listen, I'm a screenwriter, and is it theoretically possible for smallpox to survive for more than 200 years underwater in a sealed glass jar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Voice on the phone </speaker><content>Well, theoretically, yes, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Thank you.  So who do we believe — CDC or Dr. 90210? Isolate, get baseline blood draws for smallpox antibodies and vaccinate the entire family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We should test for the 21st-century suspects — varicella and measles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You're free to perform whatever unnecessary tests you want, Foreman. Slavery was abolished years ago.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>Why the hell do you guys have us quarantined in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We're just taking every precaution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Niles </speaker><content>Against what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>What do you think I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>One possibility is tetanus from the glass jar that sliced your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>I remember tetanus shots. That does not look like tetanus shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's really not worth going into, because the odds are astronomical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Again, it's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>Smallpox?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The vaccine will protect you if you don't have it and lessen the severity if you already do. B-but it's a billion-to-one, so… we don't want you to panic or anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>How do I not panic with that information? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I had some free time. I owed four hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Don't you have a case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Are you a Stepford doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>If you're busy, you don't need to be down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You're serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Yep. Get out of here </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Eve </speaker><content>I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Eve </speaker><content>I need Lamby. He doesn't want me to do it alone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What if I get someone to sit with her while you run home and get Lamby? I'll get a nurse.  Then I have to deal with a… very sick man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I think she knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Who is she, and what does she know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cuddy. And… that I faked a lab test and lied to her to save my last patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What did she do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She let me out of clinic duty by saying I had a case. She's never done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>She's also probably never ordered the pasta special in the cafeteria. Would that also have some special paranoid message to send you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You don't. If she doesn't know, all you're gonna do by sniffing around is make her suspicious. If she does know, you'll find out soon enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What if I die of curiosity in the meantime?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's not smallpox. Blood work suggests some other infection. White count is way down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That's none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Ah, probably just a dry spell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>House, you do realize we just ruled out smallpox?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You passive/aggressive bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You just asked me—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What about Foreman's unnecessary tests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Negative for varicella and measles. So all of our ideas are off the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm putting mine back on. Patient's a diver. Under increased pressure, everything in the blood gets scared, panics, runs, and hides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Antibodies could be in the joints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder, and any other joint in her smallpox-ridden body.  Good talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>'Cause I wanted you to come to me and apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I can't apologize if I haven't done anything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, you don't get to lie to me about anything. I can't compartmentalize my life like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Sorry. I have to get the needle behind the bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>I'm running out of bones. If this is a waste of time—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>What? What — what is it? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Am I gonna die? I mean, this is what terrorists want to use to kill everyone, right? Like, there's no cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>There are treatments. We can give you cidofovir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I don't think you care about the drugs' names. Bottom line — it's 30% fatal, which means your chances of being okay are about the same as a basketball player's chance at hitting a free throw, unless she finds dark, purplish skin blotches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>What would purple blotches mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>In which case, her chances are more like… Shaq hitting a free throw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, no purple skin, but take a look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Lulu </speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>There's a rash under your daughter's arm. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Like more of those gross bumps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No. It's just a regular rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>W-what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It means it's not smallpox. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Are you saying you see House's side? It's not even a side. It's a fictional construction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>She's expecting House not to lie? If she's using the relationship as a rationale to try to change things—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Wait. Wait. Are you saying it's okay for us to lie to each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>No, we have a different relationship — I think a better one. Lying was never part of it. Theirs is built on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>Oh, come on, I have to leave in, like, five minutes. Can't it wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>There's a little girl. The nurse watching her got called away. It's a long story, but I've got to babysit. I'll see you tonight.  Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>Well, I guess I can stay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Please step out of the room. I'm Dr. Broda, Head of Infection control, CDC, and your protective suits are not adequate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Turns out they don't have to be.  Rash under the arm means it's not smallpox. False alarm. Sorry. Hope the traffic wasn't too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Rash is consistent with smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Not if it presents after pustules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>She's probably just allergic to the bedsheets or the hospital gown, and you simply didn't notice it  We're gonna airlift blood and tissue samples to Atlanta. We'll have the DNA results in 18 hours. In the meantime, please, step out of the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You brought the plane? Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>When we left, Julie's fever had climbed to over 103.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You know how you can tell there's nothing to be done? Chase showed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So you guys just want to do nothing for the next 18 hours until they tell us it's not smallpox? Can't we spend the time discussing what looks like smallpox but isn't smallpox? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Molluscum contagiosum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It's the middle of the night in the Netherlands. Nobody's working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oh, you can always find someone.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Geerte </speaker><content>Why you want I translate? I do topless, toys,  and—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She can translate however she feels most comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Geerte </speaker><content>Whatever. You put in credit card. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>House, the hospital has translators on call—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Shut up.  Honey, could you email our new friend the Captain's log?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Isn't she adorable? Go ahead and skip to the part where people get sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Geerte </speaker><content>Mm… ah, here."The passenger has a fever, shaking, and red eyes." Ooh. Also African man make go in his pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What about the Captain, the crew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Geerte </speaker><content>Mm, no. It say only African men sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It can't be smallpox. Airborne transmission means it's an equal-opportunity killer. We're looking for a disease that discriminates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Sickle cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The disease doesn't have to be racist. It could be classist. Vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight weakens the immune system, makes the slaves more vulnerable to malaria or dengue fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I don't know how you get pustules from any of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Captain and crew got clean drinking water. Slaves drank whatever they could. Scrofula. That's what they called cervical T.B. lymphadenitis in the 1700s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Scrofulicious — that's what they called "annoying" in the 1700s. Is she wrong? Then they died for nothing. Those slaves could have led long, fulfilling lives, mowing my ancestors' lawns. Foreman. Can I speak to you outside for a second?  We need to test for T.B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>T.B. might fit, but it's too slow-moving to kill her anytime soon. There's no way the CDC's gonna give us access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's why we don't think it's T.B. We think it's meningococcal disease, which could kill her before the results come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>And once I gain access, I run the T.B. Test. You could have said all that in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>In front of the narc? As if.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Elaborate measures? We took a walk — a walk you would have taken anyway. Actually, I saved you from the horrible post-differential traffic jam.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We believe the rash under Julie's armpit is actually petechial spots. When added to the high fever, the vomiting—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>There haven't been any seizures, no stiff neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>If I could just gain access to the patient, I can investigate the rash further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>I'll take a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I can wear your gear. I'll take every necessary precaution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>You come to me with a weak diagnosis. I even offer to investigate, but that's not good enough for you. What's really going on here? (While he speaks, he notices Niles, walking hesitantly in the other isolation room. Niles falls to his knees, then brings his hand to his forehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Sir… are you feeling all right in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Niles </speaker><content>It's just a headache.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>This is not meningococcus. You're not getting in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chases </speaker><content>Not really — not for them and not for you — the dad's new symptoms are consistent with them having smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Would be if he had a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He does have a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No. He just said, "ow," and held his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Actually, he said, "ow."Then he said, "it's a headache."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Which could be indicative of head pain. Headache is caused by muscle tension or vascular stretching. Head pain is caused by trauma, which would include such events as a bleed in the brain from T.B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We're back to T.B.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We never left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We'll need to do a C.T. And I sort of have a hunch that the CDC's not gonna approve of us moving the patient.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You just tried this. I'm not a better liar than Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sure, you are. You're descended from convicts.  Plus, there's no lie this time. It's a bait and switch. You propose that we don't have to move him if we do a pneumoencephalograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>That's 60-year-old technology that killed patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Exactly. He'll compromise on the C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>This isn't Cuddy. Your Jedi mind tricks won't work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You don't trust me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Instead of whatever lie you're gonna tell Broda, why don't you just tell him the truth?  If we are honest and reasonable—</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hold off a minute. I'm in overtime.  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Uh, Broda agreed to C.T. the dad's brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, that sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>But I thought that's what you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I shouldn't have gotten it with the truth. He's a hypocrite. His position ever since he's been here has been—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I-I pointed out that either we're right, and he's the hero for ending the crisis, or he's right, and he gets to be the first person to look at a brain infected with smallpox. C.T. scans weren't around 30 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Good work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So I guess honesty is the best policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why'd you say that? Seriously… To establish your viewpoint, as if I didn't already know it, or to demonstrate some weird cross-generational female solidarity with Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Actually, I was just trying to fill the awkward silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oh.  Why have they stopped? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You can't go out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why did you stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Get out of the hallway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He does not have smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Yes, he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>He's just developed pustules. He's now too dangerous to transport. Get out of the hallway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What about the daughter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Pustule count is way up. Vitals are way down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Means I was wrong. But to be precise, I was right before I was wrong, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So we just give up and go home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Actually, somebody locked the front door, but, yeah, we… give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We might as well keep—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We have our diagnosis. If you're eager, you can go find us a new case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I guess she's eager or has a blind spot for sarcasm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I just want to look at the rash under her arm to see if it's matured—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>You can look through the glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I need to be closer. If the pustules are at a different stage—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>She's comfortable. We're gonna have our results back in eight hours. If it's not smallpox, you can be the first one in there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Why are you just standing out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Uh… I'm just trying to help. If you're feeling up to it, can you sit up and show me the rash under your arm?  Uh, wait. The soles of your feet. There aren't any lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Julie </speaker><content>Who cares? They're everywhere else. This is torture. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Eve? Guess who came by the hospital for a visit?  Hello, Eve. Oh, no!  All right. I'm gonna get a couple of nice nurses to come in here and get you two ready for the treatment, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>Lamby was dirty. Um, we gave her a bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Eve </speaker><content>This isn't Lamby! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Julie doesn't have smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Did I just dream the part where I finally agreed it was smallpox? Well, if what I thought was reality was actually a dream, then the reverse… Oh, my God. I had a threesome with Beyonce and Lady Gaga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>She doesn't have pustules on her palms or the soles of her feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The dad does have pustules there. So how does he get smallpox, but it skips her?  If I leave like that, you should follow. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, then just — we gave it to him. No pustules on the daughter's palms, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>So therefore your theory is you asked me to take the dad's blood, but I accidentally injected him with smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Exactly, although technically, it was the vaccinia virus, which is what the smallpox vaccine is made from. Same symptoms as smallpox, but only half the calories and almost none of the lethality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You can if you're immunocompromised. Am I the only one who reads these things?  Dad had kidney cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Six years ago. He's been in remission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, it's obviously back. Shot his immune system, made him vulnerable to the vaccinia, which will get better on interferon. So if he responds to the treatment, that proves he doesn't have smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Then what does the daughter have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that. Can we please just focus on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What's more likely — he got smallpox the day after we immunized him for it, or he's sick from the vaccine itself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>You got any proof the kidney cancer is back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, let me give him this.  When he gets better, that'll be the proof you need. I'll put on one of your fancy spacesuits, and I promise I won't kiss him on an open sore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hey! Look, there's the proof you need. There's blood in the urine bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>His kidneys are shutting down. He's in the final stages of the disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If smallpox was causing the kidney failure, the blood would be brown. It's red because the kidney cancer is back, and this is not smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>I'm not opening that door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, that makes one of us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Broda </speaker><content>Hey! Hey! You're insane!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But I'm right. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Does seem to track suspiciously closely.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Sam </speaker><content>Well, you have a right to be. We weren't honest. You might not know this yet, but sometimes adults mess up.  Can I tell you something, and you keep it just between us?  I'm not great with kids. I love them, but I get scared that I'm gonna do the wrong thing, and then… I usually do.  And that's what I did with the lying. And I'm very sorry about that. The reason why I did the wrong thing was because I was trying to get you to do the right thing. Your mommy and your Lamby both really need you to get better. So… do you think that… you could be really brave… and do the right thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Eve </speaker><content>I'll try.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Right! 'Cause there are only two diseases in the whole wide world — what else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>There's got to be something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>No, there doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>There are still no pustules on her feet. All the reasons you thought it wasn't smallpox still exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Forget her feet. Forget all those other reasons. Look at him now. The pox are dome-shaped. They're on 80% of his body, and they're not scabbing over. This is textbook smallpox. DDX'ing at this point isn't gonna make a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Don't say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I'm sorry. House… You screwed up going in there.</content></utterance>
