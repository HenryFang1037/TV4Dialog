<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>So, uh, what did you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Too late for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>I'll tell you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Come on, the bell just rang. We still got time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>I'm ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Why now, all of a sudden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>What, you don't want to anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Yeah, I do. I'm just wondering what changed your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>If you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>But we didn't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>We weren't doing anything.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hey, kids. How you boys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I certainly hope so.  You know what this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Boy 1 </speaker><content>A laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Password-protected laptop that I need you nerds to hack into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content> No insecticides or toxic cleaners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Check the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Boy 1 </speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Your roommate's doctor. You remember your roommate, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's what the morons at the Rutgers Student Medical Center thought, which may be part of the reason he just coughed up a lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Boy 1 </speaker><content>What do you mean, he coughed up a lung?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He coughed… after which the respiratory organ which resided in his chest resided in his mouth… Actually, his hand. Well, his mouth, then his hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Bathroom's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content> What's in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Boy 1 </speaker><content>Just soda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Mind if I have some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Boy 1 </speaker><content>You want my drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You got a problem with that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Boy 2 </speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Actually, I do. You barge into our room, start looking through our personal, private stuff, demand I hack into a computer I think I can safely assume doesn't belong—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration? Please continue. You were talking about personal privacy.  What, you're finished? Well, allow me to retort. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Interesting theory. Can you prove it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>Doctors don't carry guns. They don't shoot people, and they definitely don't search patients' homes. Plus, I've seen Pulp Fiction — the movie you're totally ripping off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Wait, uh, was it Timmy Morgan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>It had to be him. He's, like, totally obsessed with old movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>So you're here to talk to the principal about something Timmy did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I got no problem with Timmy. And even if I did, I ain't no snitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Then why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>To dig myself out of a hole. Instead I dug a bigger one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>What'd you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What'd you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>What'd you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What happened to your eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>It's none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Actually, it's none of yours. I'm a doctor. It's a few days old, so that's not why you're here, unless you two got busted for some sort of revenge plot. But then you'd look angry instead of… ashamed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>I'm not ashamed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Interesting. You defensively insist that you're not ashamed, which, of course, means you are ashamed. And yet, you're the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>You want to know how she got the black eye? Tell us why you're here first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Anyone ever tell you you're annoying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I didn't kill anybody. I have to be here, so I figured I'd punch up the stakes in the first act. But we did, and almost always do, search the patient's home. And if we tell them first, then they can hide something that we need to know in order to figure out what's wrong with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>Why would they hide something that could be killing them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Because they are morons. They're all morons, and everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>Wait, if everybody lies, then that means you're lying right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I didn't say everybody always lies… Aristotle. And on that note, unless there are any questions… Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Oh, Dr. Hourani… before you finish, maybe you could describe what you actually do. You know, like if someone comes in for a routine physical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You want routine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>It just feels kind of, like, numb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You do a lot of bicycle riding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>How long have you been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>It's 12 years next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content> You have six kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Well, you don't think it could have anything to do with that, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Probably. How often do you use your vibrator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Your battery-operated Brad Pitt. After giving the gift of life to six eight-pound, four-ounce wrecking balls, I think I can safely assume it's an industrial-strength model?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You wanted routine. Am I done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Maybe we should just move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>I meant with your typical day. I assume you see more than one patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Okay. Then I guess we will move on to our next guest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>Wait, if you only see one patient, what do you do the rest of the day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Dr. Hourani?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Just in time for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I meant sex… Fine. Lunch. How about we start with a small tossed salad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>As of this morning, I'm on a diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Meaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, you told me you were supposed to be busy 20 minutes ago. But you were obviously able to put them off then, there's no reason you can't put them off now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>How about, "I wanted to then, and now I don't"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Get your finger off my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We obviously have something we need to discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Now is not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If you're mad because you don't feel you're getting the necessary amount of “affection,” all you have to do is ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If memory serves, I enjoyed a healthy Sunday brunch. So your insinuation—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Ow! What is your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So that's what a typical doctor does on a typical day. Any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>What's a vibrator?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Why was your girlfriend so mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It doesn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Well, obviously it matters. I mean, if she's your girlfriend, you should care how she feels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I mean, it doesn't matter to the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>It's the most important part of the story. It's the only thing that does matter. You don't kiss her enough — is that the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Which, by your definition, means it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We kiss plenty. Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Then what's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>What's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Excuse me. When exactly will the commandant be back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Receptionist </speaker><content>Shouldn't be much longer, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Oh, so now you're not gonna talk. That's real mature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>All right, fine. We got busted for kissing behind the school. Now you know why we're here. So tell us why you're here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The deal was about the black eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>And we didn't kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So you were just making him beg, huh? I didn't have you pegged as a tease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>I'm not a tease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The available evidence suggests otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>I'm not a tease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Prove it… By–by telling me your story.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>You're a pathetic loser, jerk! And I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain cancer and your lips were the cure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She actually said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Well, yeah, that was, like, two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>It doesn't matter. I clearly didn't lead him along or anything like that, which proves I'm not a tease. So why is your girlfriend mad at you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm getting a kind of bossy vibe. I take it you're into that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Don't answer! Your turn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What seems to be the problem, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phillip </speaker><content>I'm having more difficulty breathing and some pain in my chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're new, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Nurse </speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I just moved from Chicago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Chicago's awesome. What part are you from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We need to get a chest C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Excuse me, I'm the senior team member, which means we don't need anything unless I say we need it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content> Do you want to have an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You want to have a threesome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You can't talk to her like that. I'm telling Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We need a chest C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Taub and Chase </speaker><content>Get it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>Isn't that, like, sexual harassment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Not if you're good-looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>You said the one guy was short with a big nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Guess that's not the only thing that's big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>It means he's lying… again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Because you can't handle the truth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>That's so easy. A Few Good Men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Okay, I give up. I think we should move on to our next guest. Mr. Dryden… uh, works for one of the largest advertising agencies in New York City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Kids </speaker><content>Boring! Boring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content> Can we at least hear what happened to the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Kids </speaker><content> Yeah! Please…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>If Dr. Hourani promises to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Patient's dead. Floor is yours, Don.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Dryden </speaker><content>Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>He's not dead. You said earlier he was still in the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He's got a cough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>You said he coughed up a lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>What about the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>Who cares about the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>Yeah, and he already said he was lying about that, you moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Gabe… we do not use that word here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>He did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, and I was talking about people like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Kids </speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Dr. Hourani, please, could you just finish, quickly, so we can move on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Nurse </speaker><content>I don't know what's wrong. He was stable for a while, and then all of a sudden, he just—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Bronchial infection must be from a drug-resistant strain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>O-2 sats are plummeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We need to get him on a bronchodilator before he goes into respiratory arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Suction, sit him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Start blow by oxygen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I think it's his… It's his lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>That actually happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes, it really happened. I take cases that other doctors fail to diagnose, which is why I only take one at a time. My current patient is a college student. He's actually in the hospital right now. And, yes, he really did cough up a large portion of dead lung tissue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>How's that even possible?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>How's that even possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Primary squamous carcinoma could cause lung tissue to basically disintegrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It's not cancer. F.O.B. was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's not an infection either. Broad-spectrum antibiotics haven't had any effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Who password-protects a computer they keep in a locked desk in a locked office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Someone who works with someone who thinks it's okay to break into other people's homes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>An amebic liver abscess could rupture through the diaphragm into the thorax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Not when his liver-function tests are all normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>His dorm mates are computer science majors. If they're fabricating chips, they could be working with all kinds of different toxic solvents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We need to search the dorm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>"We"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oui. Allons-y. While we're out, do a thoracoscopic lung biopsy and a c-ANCA, because it's sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>But if you think it's sarcoidosis, why are you…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Gabe </speaker><content>So you really did force his roommate to hack into the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why would I lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>But whose laptop is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>It's your girlfriend's, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's not my girlfriend. I'm just interested in her because she's a client, and she sleeps above her covers — four feet above her covers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>Ghostbusters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sophie </speaker><content>So that's why she's so mad — you looked through her computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, that part happened after she got mad. First she got mad. Then I stole her computer to fix things. And then we got the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Corwin </speaker><content>Wait, so you tried to fix your relationship by stealing her computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, when you say it like that… Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Female lawyer </speaker><content>Looks like you're the moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Kids </speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>No way. You didn't get her laptop by blowing down the door of her office. That's from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Just seeing if you're still paying attention. It was actually more subtle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Timmy </speaker><content>The Thomas Crown Affair — the Steve McQueen version.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Dryden </speaker><content>Excuse me. But there are others here who would like a chance to speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Go right ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Kids </speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Female lawyer </speaker><content>You poisoned a room full of patients so you could steal your girlfriend's laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I didn't poison anybody. I spilled some hydrogen sulfide and ammonia on the floor, thinking the stench would clear the place out. But instead of breathing through his nose, some idiot decided to hold his breath. He passes out, and before I know it, the place is a perfect storm of mass hysteria… Although it worked out just as well.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You think you can tell why she's mad by reading budget spreadsheets and per diem schedules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I know why she's mad. What I need to know is how to make her un-mad. And step one is gaining access to the journal on her laptop, where she records her innermost thoughts… Instead of just watching porn with me.  Oh, grow up. If porn was bad, why would there be so many nuns in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Why is she mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was myself, which, by the way, she's supposed to love unconditionally.  I didn't do anything! We had a great weekend. Went to a blues club, we watched Cinderfella on DVD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It doesn't matter. She's being unreasonable, and I have to fix it. I need to know what's really important to her. I need something big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We're past that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I don't know her pets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>She's never mentioned a pet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, yeah, but I wasn't listening. She's not mad because I don't remember a dead dog's name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Her first dog was Ronaldo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I didn't ask. Try both.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>I wasn't forcing her to do anything that she didn't want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You're hoping for a career in the NBA or the NFL?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>The bet let her do what she wanted to do while still being able to act like she didn't, so her friends wouldn't get all, like, calling her a slut or something.  Not that it's slutty or anything. It's just a kiss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>No, you thought we weren't, and that's exactly what you want, because you don't want to tell us why was she mad at you! You tell us you don't want to do your job because you're too busy trying to break into your girlfriend's laptop to figure out a way to make her not mad at you. But you don't tell us why she was mad at you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>Well, maybe it's not the swapping spit that bothers her, but the fact that you don't listen to her. Had she warned you not to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oh, I listen to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>But you just said before that you didn't.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>It's my toothbrush, and it's not just once. And it's not like I'd even care, but you totally destroy it. You're supposed to brush with it, not gnaw on it like a rawhide bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I think Miss Four Cavities' time would be better spent copying Mr. No Cavities instead of complaining about him.

<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>You're gross and dumb. You listen to what she says just so you can tell her how wrong she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You are clueless and naive. I have to tell her that she's wrong, 'cause no one else will. She's the boss, which means she's surrounded by morons who are either afraid of her, or they want to kiss up to her, or they want to… kiss her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>But not you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It would if we'd actually started the treatment, but we didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why the hell not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Because it's not sarcoidosis. If you were here, you would know that. He's dying. What's left of his lung is collapsing. F.N.A. of the mediastinal—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I don't care about the F.N.A. What I care about is how he responds to the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Just do it.  Sarcoidosis… is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that the cowards who spend their time excluding what it isn't usually cause their patients to die from what it is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Just because he's dying doesn't make it interesting.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>A yellow light does not mean stop. It was, at the most, 20% my fault. Since insurance companies automatically put 100% of the fault on the rear-ender, my little lie was actually an effort to achieve an outcome closer to the truth.

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>I guess… I don't want to do it like this. Sorry for shooting the puck so hard and tricking you in the bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>You didn't trick me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>Yeah, I did. I gave Madison a Red Dead Revolver cheat code so she'd hit your foot with the rope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>You're right. It's just… I really like you. And I'm pretty sure you like me too. But I don't want to play any more games. When you want — I mean, if you ever want to, just tell me you're ready, and, you know… Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Colleen </speaker><content>He's not always a jerk. And neither are you. She obviously likes you. Just stop using her toothbrush and stop playing games. She'll still like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Zack </speaker><content>She's bossy… but she's usually right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Is there a third option?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You can call the police. You can turn me in for lying at the accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Let her daughter in. She's a great kid, and Dr. Cuddy is a great mom. They'll fit in perfectly here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I don't know. I just know that I need to do something. I need her in my life. You know what it's like to actually need someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Can I be excused?</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's just food. Something small enough to go down the wrong pipe, too big to get washed out by the bronchial lavage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Wouldn't show up on a C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But would cause the C.O.P.D. And wouldn't respond to steroids or antibiotics. Prep him for exploratory surgery and start the betting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Betting?</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I know.  I just want to say that I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Shouldn't you be saying that to Sanford Wells? A fifth-grade career day? You really thought you could pull that off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I figured, how hard could it be?  And I wanted to prove to you that I do care about your needs and Rachel's. I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Is that why you also stole my computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>And then threw it in the trash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I did not throw it, I placed it, knowing that the janitor would find it and know it was yours and return it to you unharmed. I'm a moron. But that doesn't mean I-I don't care about you, that I don't think about you, that I don't want you to be happy. I was wrong. You were right. I can do better. Just… give me a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>So what were you — an Astronaut or a Bullfighter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was myself… for the most part.  I know you're still upset, so I'm gonna… I'll leave you to —  to deal with it however you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House.  You want to come over for dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'd love to.</content></utterance>
