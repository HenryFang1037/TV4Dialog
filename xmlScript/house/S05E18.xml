<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm waiting for a follow-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you're talking about Mr. Kazden, he has a deceased sticker on his file. As do all the other follow-ups you have scheduled for today.  Whoops. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I had colds all winter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I feel run-down like maybe something big is coming on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Runny nose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>No. I know it sounds weird, I'm a nurse, but could you run maybe a CBC or thyroid up —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult.  Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's urinating on herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's having a seizure. If she hadn't peed it would…</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>35-year-old woman. Head of nursing at an old age home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Neurological symptoms and "P"? Oh, green pee. I get it. Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>"Neuro" is also written in green. Does that mean she has green neurological symptoms as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indicates irony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pseudomonas infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She'd have a fever. Toxins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why are we taking this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry I'm late. And, yes, green pee does meet the only diagnostic requirement you care about… it's interesting. But is it worth us taking this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Us" aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay, I accept. She has adult-onset epilepsy, and she really likes those Saint Patrick's Day beers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go check out the house and the office for toxins and infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her neuro exam was normal. No subsequent seizures. It's not life-threatening. It's not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Luckily, neither are you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You and House this morning, the way you were arguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Airing disagreements doesn't qualify as arguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Come on, man. I'm just trying to help. We're friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There are 400 Japanese teenagers you were playing Halo with last night you're better friends with. Your avatar should ask their avatars how they're doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I consider you a good friend even if we don't hang that much outside work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I wasn't arguing with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You kinda were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Fine, I was.  And you know what, I was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You got conned. Methylthioninium chloride. Notable side effect, green urine. She's a nurse. She knows the dosage. Knows how to fake a seizure. She pees pea soup and gets the warm attention of doctors all week long. She's a Munchausen and you're her mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No good reason it'd be sitting in her desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat. We peed in private.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her problem is phenol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Carbolic acid? Yeah, maybe she accidentally inhaled some at a gout treatment facility circa 1890.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She'd have to drink five bottles a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her house. Bye.  And you can start her on charcoal hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning.  Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Oh, you were lying about the throat spray. That does make more sense. So why are you wasting Taub's time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory.  Zip.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Chris? Chris Taub, right? Neil Zane. I was two years under you at Collegiate High, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>So you're some big doctor here now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm a doctor. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>I was speaking at an econ course over at the university. I tripped and banged my leg.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>You want me to have another seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dammit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Please forgive me, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I'm not a Munchausen. I'm gonna die unless you help me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'll have to come up with something more original.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>A cat predicted my death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Oh, I've had this dizziness problem for a while now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You get checked for labyrinthitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>On antibiotics for a week. No difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lie down a sec.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, I'm dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's normal.  So what are you teaching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Entrepreneurship. I'm a CEO, Ost Tech Industries. We make medical devices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>All right, you can sit up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>So did that tell you anything? Did I…  Oh, my God. The… you just cured me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I figured you had a tiny calcium deposit in your inner ear. I just shifted it around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>I've seen three doctors for this. I'm buying you dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Come on. I'm also an investor in a club. We'll make it a night out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, I'm married. Boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>I know some married people who aren't boring.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>This is the cat, Debbie. Have you heard of her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>She was in the news. We found her as a kitten. She lives in the nursing home. She only sleeps next to people when they're about to die.  Ten patients in the last year. And then yesterday she did it to me while I was sitting on my couch. Please, the whole staff, the doctors even, we all know this is real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Can you come back later? I have some business I’m conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Just watch this video.  It'll prove I'm not lying. Dr. House, I am begging you.  Chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She's faking. The cat told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Listen.  Soft breath sounds. Means it's bronchospasm. Can't fake that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>TV Announcer</speaker><content>Debbie the cat spends most of her time just prowling the halls, the queen of her own private world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content> When Debbie climbs on a patient's bed and goes to sleep, we call the loved ones and tell them to come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You want to treat her? She's a nut job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us human?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content> It's like Debbie's here on earth to bring people to the other side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>TV Announcer</speaker><content>The doctors we spoke to also agree…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nut jobs get sick too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So you think this cat story is nonsense. And you admit she faked her earlier symptoms. But you still think she's actually sick now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Confirm she's faking or I'm gonna have to kick her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's that voice again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll give you 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Consecutive?</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die. Bronchospasm, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Bronchitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No cough, no fever, and Blofeld didn’t smoke a cigar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He might have. Dude had a lair. Means he was rich.  Rich people enjoy a good stogie, sometimes send them as gifts. Hey, Taub! Did that sound like I was awkwardly trying to segue into making a point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Emphysema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lungs were clean on the CT. Dogs can be trained to predict diabetic comas, epileptic seizures; they can smell cancer. It is possible there's something in this cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Debbie was able to predict there was something wrong with the patient before you were. Is that a coincidence too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe the cat didn't predict anything. Might have caused the deaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, it could be cat scratch fever or visceral larva migrans. Maybe he didn't kill everyone at the nursing home, but it may be killing Morgan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Those cigars were for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, that reminds me, why is some fancy CEO sending you a box of Cuban cigars? Is it related to your money worries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What money worries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Extrapolating from the fact that he's been skipping his morning muffin, I'd say that he lost almost all his money on the market last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm on a diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolio you forget to log off. But it's mostly the muffins. Scope her for worms in the lungs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We could help out in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, it takes at least four people to look inside a crazy woman's lungs for imaginary worms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So you're in a good mood again. You need another speech about what a great friend I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm telling my wife we don't need to downsize, but maybe we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You really lost all that money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't care about the money. I just feel bad for Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She married a guy in one situation and ended up with another. That's hard on anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thanks. Makes me feel much better hearing my wife's a gold digger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No, I just meant she married this master of the universe, successful surgeon, and now he's basically, you know, a flunky for this mad scientist… who saves lives, so that's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There are no worms in the lungs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What else could cause bronchospasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Severe acid reflux.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No esophagitis. It's not reflux.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why are you pushing a crash cart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why are we in the coma patients’ room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You actually think the cat is going to predict someone's death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You didn't keep this patient despite the cat, you kept this patient because of the cat. You're scared there's something to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would. Cat version will have to do.  Are you scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cats' brains are always in alpha mode. The few scientific tests that have seemed to confirm psychic phenomena, that's where it takes place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I was kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We still have a human patient, right? Airborne allergens possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Skin test was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lungs may be more sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or House just screwed up. If you misinterpreted the breath sounds as soft instead of loud, it's laryngospasm instead of bronchospasm, which you can get from a simple panic attack, which she was having.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I also heard the lung sounds too, Taub. You saying I screwed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>"Screwed up" is maybe too harsh, but yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't you want to check their charts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to even subconsciously</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Her name's Debbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are those welts on that guy's arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Were they here when we got here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> He has a severe cat allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Look at Debbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good news, Mister… Limpert, when you don't die tonight you will finally have done something good for the world as opposed to your life as a… fireman. Foreman's airborne allergen theory makes the most sense. Do a methacholine challenge on Catgirl to check it out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Genetically modified for tastiness. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two years before that, you got chicken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid.

<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>He was in school. He was having his morning snack. And he choked. And the teacher saw it and they did everything that they were supposed to. He shouldn't have died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want to make it make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content> What’s wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s meaningless, is what’s wrong. What’s wrong is that it doesn’t do a thing to bring your kid back, or put you and your ex together again.  Rash on your neck. Probably not enough for Cuddy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, doc.  Breath sound soft to you, doc?  Hooray! You're officially sick.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Churg-Strauss fits best. Here's the plan… Taub, change the litter box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is pathetic. You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just clean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let House do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, that'll happen. He won't just continue to let our room smell like cat pee. I'll clean it next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Now that you've delivered that important lesson, I'm gonna go test the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, you think your bag's gonna die now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Now you're punishing me because you think I'm superstitious? What do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not so much about me caring per se. It's more about me wondering why you're such a credulous idiot. Thirteen, start the patient on steroids for the Churg-Strauss. Unless we have something we need to argue about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is good stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>The best. It's made from the distilled sweat of recently laid-off hedge fund managers. Aren't you happy you came out tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah. I wasn't actually going to, but not the greatest day at work. I used to have an office like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Used to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When I was a plastic surgeon. But one day I took stock of my life and … Uh, screw it. I had an affair with the daughter of one of my partners. They signed a non-disclosure. I signed a non-compete. And the funny thing is I wound up telling my wife anyway. You like your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Same as you. Same as everyone. It has its ups and downs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're lying to make me feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Yeah, it's the best. I'm in charge, you know? I'm a kid with toys. Speaking of which, what do you think of the prototype?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> It's amazing. Gotta make it a half-inch smaller though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>You serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I got small hands, 6.5 gloves, like women surgeons, which are your fastest-growing market. Meaning the girls would have to use two hands to hit the switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Why do I bother paying the idiots that work for me? Put down that crap you're drinking, because I am breaking out the really good stuff.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I went to the bathroom. My urine…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Green again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>It's brown. I didn't do anything, honest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm just a girl who can't say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It is possible she's still faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's "Unchausen".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm just saying the brown urine doesn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We've ruled out every possible cause for brown urine. No blood in the urine. Liver and kidneys fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Brown could be fecal. A fistula…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How do we know the urine is still brown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Had to be. Once you've gone brown…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we've ruled out everything that can make the urine brown, what if it just looked brown? If the green dye never left her system, what plus green makes brown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We scoped her when we checked for the fistula. There's no tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I wasn't scared by the umbrella either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? Not everything's about you, Kutner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I realize it's stupid. I just… I don't know everything. I don't want to invite…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed. But "you're stupid" works just as well. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Why is there a ladder here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oops. Forgot that one.  Scopes don't work as well as pillcams. Give her one. Find the tumor. Come with me, tiny Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry I was late again. I've got a long commute from the poor house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Knew it when I hired you. You'd eventually miss the money, being the big shot like your new CEO friend, if that night club stamp on your hand is any indication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Don't worry, I'm not quitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bad example. I did tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You will note how “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” has snuggled up by Coma Guy over there. And more importantly, she did yesterday as well. And he's still breathing. We done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content> Thank you for showing me this. But maybe she's just confused in this new environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return. His followers gave away all their possessions and showed up in a field. Guess who didn't show. So the preacher said that he miscalculated, and they went right back the next month but with more followers. Every time he was irrefutably proved wrong, it redoubled everyone's belief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I know I sound just like them, but I also know you’re wrong. Something terrible’s gonna happen to me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be dumb as she might be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This woman lost her kid. Why are you attacking beliefs that give her a little bit of comfort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care if her superstitions make her feel better. I just want her to think more clearly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh. Maybe that could make her as happy as you are.  Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Experimenting.  Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It’s just not cute anymore!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You already experimented on the coma guy. Haven't you proved your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to the patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why are you so obsessed with this? Can't you just call her an idiot and leave everyone alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Billy</speaker><content>You're a liar. Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, okay. Uh, kids, playtime's over.  You know what, this is a good thing. Because either you're starting to doubt yourself, which is healthy, or —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't believe in the legend of goodbye kitty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Or, you're starting to give a crap what other people think. Which is just another way of saying you give a crap about other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'd love to hear more of your theory, but I don't give a crap.  Also, the pillcam's back.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Polypoid. Raised edges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Raised edges are actually necessary, since that's the opening to the appendix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How many times are we gonna watch this? There's no tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe it has something to do with that little red dot dancing around down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're wasting time looking for cancer. She's still walking around. She's still pretty healthy. Maybe it's something minor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe we're not wasting time. We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's not cancer. We found spider veins on her back. They weren't there when she came in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spider veins means Cushing's. Could cause an abdominal disturbance, brown urine…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>But the bronchospasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cushing's myopathy. It's uncommon but…  Wait a second. You didn't wake me up to tell me a symptom that's not killing her. What else is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I think she's dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just told you it's Cushing's. We treat…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I don't mean because of the spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If that's my high school gym teacher…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's your coma patient. He was stable for a year and a half, and he just died. The cat was right, House.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Say "puss" one more time. It's the sixth "puss" that really does it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. Sulking will solve everything. That cat sat on my lap, and that cat knows something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You believe it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yesterday it was all a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yesterday it was until I unintentionally proved it wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Patient must have Cushing's. We have to figure out whether it's based in…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cat's nose is powerful. It could smell liver or kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly, except if you'd glanced at the nursing home files I had faxed over this morning, you'd know that most of the patients' livers and kidneys were fine; what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>MRI‘s aren't telling us if the Cushing's in her adrenals or her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So check her ACTH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>A cat's vision is at the blue end of the spectrum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ACTH is 11.7. It's too close to tell. We can't treat the wrong organ 'cause that won't solve anything. She could have a cortisol storm. Could kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, maybe as the senior fellow you could have made sure that my doors were closed, so that I could be concentrating on the cat instead of looking for the cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You all right? Your nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What'd he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Sounds like he said "do you like cranberry juice?"  Crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cheaper than fake blood. And more cran-tastic. Don't ever leave my door open like that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're playing pranks and this woman could be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain. If he finds something, it's there. If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not who I used to be. I'm scared. That's not a way to live. I want to come work for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Jeez, Chris, you didn't think… I didn't mean to imply that I could hire you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You said you needed guys like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>I know, but… You don't have an MBA. And I just hired a chief medical officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let me invest in that laser scalpel start-up. I got money saved. Not a ton but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>We put in a $2 million minimum for the first round financing. Look, I guess I could take you on at a smaller number. But you have to understand, it wouldn't be some quick payoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I know it's not gonna change my life overnight. I just need to start changing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Neil</speaker><content>Okay then, let's start.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What exactly are you hoping to find inside your dead coma guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Catnip. Chew toy. I don't know. That's why I'm looking…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Your patient had cardiac arrest during the venous sampling. We got her back, but her heart's still tenuous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That tell us anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's weak, possibly dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So nothing. What about the ACTH?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Slightly elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That confirms the Cushing's is in the brain… go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are you sure that it's Cushing's? You'd expect central body obesity. She's in good shape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it had a normal presentation, there wouldn't be a cat involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So it's the brain. That means the next question is whether to remove the pituitary right now…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not a question for me. That's a question for the patient. You'll present both sides and let her decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I've got to stop telling you my theories. You always just try to prove me wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass getting bigger at the full moon? I confirmed that one. Photo’s on my blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Normally, you'd be up in the patient room hectoring her on what to do. Instead you're up to your elbows in some irrelevant dead guy who may or may not be connected to a magic cat because you want to prove to me that you don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Case is over. I'm exploring a scientific mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I put up with your obsessions. I even encourage them for one reason: they save lives. I don't know what you're doing now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cushing's means your body's overproducing a hormone called cortisol. The recommended course of action is to suppress it with drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>And that will cure it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just treat it. It could come back. The only permanent solution is to cut into your brain and remove your pituitary gland, but the surgery's dangerous. Your heart stopped on the table once already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I want the surgery. This thing is gonna kill me if I don't kill it first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because of the cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Do you want to tell me what an idiot I'm being?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. I really believe that there are things that science can't understand. That there is a role for faith and prayer. But it's in the waiting room. Not the O.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>There's a reason I got sick. There's a reason for all the bad things that have happened to me. I don't know what that reason is. But I know that if there isn't one… If there's no greater purpose in the world. Then it's not a world I want to live in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll schedule an operating room.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths. It was just trying to keep warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, dead people are renowned for their warm glow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They are if they're feverish, like three of the patients were. Or if they're wasting away, like the other eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wasting doesn't…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it does. If it means someone sticks a heating blanket on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Congrats. Because of your crazy obsession with this cat, you've solved a completely trivial mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Completely trivial. My God. It's clearly only partially trivial. Debbie climbed on Morgan too, which means she was overheated. So what causes flushing and mimics every Cushing's symptom except central body obesity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cancer. A corticotropin-producing carcinoid tumor of the intestine. But your pillcam didn't find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Means it must be somewhere the pillcam couldn't go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The appendix. Congratulations, you probably saved her life. You definitely saved her needless surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I did.  What's the O.R. extension number? Just curious.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wouldn't come here for thanks. That would be ungracious. It's more about gloating. You were about to cut out a piece of your brain just to chase some crazy superstition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>But I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You "didn't" didn't do anything. I stopped it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>And what made you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Science. Logic. Reason. Pick any three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>A cat chooses that exact moment to sit on your computer. Maybe that's science and logic and reason or maybe it's something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>I looked up the preacher from New York State. His followers never faded out. They became the Seventh Day Adventists. A major religion. That man changed the course of history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because his followers were as deluded as he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Morgan</speaker><content>Maybe he just gave them something to live for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Feel better. </content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kutner!  Cat pee on my chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Blood on my face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fake blood!  You pay for the dry-cleaning. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why are you still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I’m not sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I guess he was impressed that you stood up to him — and got a cat to pee on his chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Yeah, a cat!</content></utterance>
