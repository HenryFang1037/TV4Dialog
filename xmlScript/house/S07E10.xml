<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Sir, I'm not slacking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>You stand up. You look me in the eye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>I feel lousy. I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>"Can't" doesn't exist here! Now, you finish this course, or you're in isolation the rest of the day, you hear me?  MacDonald, you ready to make Parks eat your dust?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MacDonald</speaker><content>Sir, yes, sir!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Ready, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>What's the matter, Parks? You got a boo boo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Sir, I'm bleeding, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Is your life in immediate danger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Then you get your ass up over that wall! I said get your ass over that—aaah! Aah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>My back hurts. I can't move. Help. Help. I can't get up.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We should not be looking at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He sent out an alert. It would be rude not to look. Though I am straining my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>What are we checking out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Why? I haven't— That… is not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>That is you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content> That's me, but that  is not. Whoever did this made it smaller. Much, much smaller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Whoever did this has a bone to pick with you. Ironic, since your bone is—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>is not in that picture. My proof is right here.  You really want to see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Oh, whoa. Convinced. You have any idea who did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I don't even know where the original picture is from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>The bathroom at the Carlton Hotel. The towel. Hotel logo's reversed. Shot must have been taken in the mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We were there for Sanford Wells' wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That must narrow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>He slept with three women there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Oh, you're a whore!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>38-year-old former marine came into the E.R. with back pain. Now his bladder aches as much as his back because he can't empty it. What are we looking at this morning? Up-skirt celebrity? Endearingly funny cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Another study about gays being better parents. We were lured in by the word "lesbian." Has he taken any antihistamines or anticholinergics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nope. And the E.R. ruled out enlarged prostate, stopped colon, and spinal injury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Thanks. We can wean him off—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Steroids isn't fascinating, it's moronic. There's no other sign of hormonal imbalance. What's fascinating is that you equate discipline with bullying. Which means that your parents either disciplined you too much or too little — I'm guessing too little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's hardly surprising you agree with our patient's philosophy. You run your department like a boot camp. As if cruelty ensures performance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Oh, is this where I'm supposed to disagree with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The diagnosis of urinary retention depends on the particular mechanical cause. We need to know if there's a blockage in the urethra versus a nerve or a muscle problem with the bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fascinating… without misdirect. Cath him and see what's stopping him from emptying his bilge.  Oh, not you, Chase. Sending Captain Micropenis to deal with what is probably normal-sized equipment, it's too cruel, even for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Good morning.  And what brings the lesser Cuddy to these parts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Pediatrician appointment for an s-h-o-t. Waldenwood insists vaccination reports go in with the application.  Honey, finish your oatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Waldenwood. Is that by any chance a boarding school? Or a work camp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's our first-choice preschool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Blocks made of gold… Kids don't have to pick their own noses…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Great facilities and teachers. And they're known for their gifted program.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure that's the right place for her? Sounds a little snobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I've done my research. We visited. It's a perfect fit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You'll feel pressure. I need you to tell us when the urge to void becomes unbearable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Sorry, can't make you feel better till we make you feel worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I get it. Goes for what I do too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We cause pain when it's the only option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>The kids I work with at the camp are there because a judge sent them. I can't teach them good behaviors without first getting rid of all their bad ones. That's not gonna happen unless I push them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I don't see why metaphorical pushing has to involve actual pushing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I may work these kids hard, but I never hit them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Yeah, well, it beats the alternatives, which is ending up in jail or in a gang or… a coffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>How often do you pull that off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Two-thirds never re-offend. That's better numbers than juvie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>She's brilliant, but new to the real world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Yeah. Hey Doc, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Let's empty you out. Take this urine to Taub. Have him screen it for bacteria. I'll analyze this data.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Half hour on the phone, no go. Website won't take down the picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I thought their policy doesn't allow nude photos. Now tap the tube gently against the table to re-suspend the cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>They don't. Technically… I'm no longer nude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Maybe you should shut down your account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I tried, but whoever did this changed my password, so I can't even prove it's my page. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, there's a clue. She's got serious text skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>My password was "password."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You're a dumb whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Do any of the three seem like a more likely suspect? Maybe one was clingier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I don't even remember their names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Listen, this is a tough time for me. Breaking up with Rachel, moving into a hotel. I want you to know how much your humiliation has eased my burden. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Urine is clean for bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Not surprising, since his bladder tests show that his pain problem is really a nerve problem. Neurogenic bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Could mean spinal cord tumor, cerebral palsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>House is gonna go right for syphilis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>How can he be so sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Rare complication of an embarrassing illness. It's practically a House special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I want to get ahead. Let's go test his blood for syphilis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Okay, I'm gonna take some blood. This will only hurt for a second. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Stop it! Stop trying to kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Hey, let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>That girl was trying to kill me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Let her go. Security, get some help in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's fine. How 'bout we get back to someone who isn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Differential diagnosis. Back pain, neurogenic bladder, psychosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>A symptom which we learned about when he choked me. Hate to slow us down by acknowledging it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And yet you have. Tertiary syphilis fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The tests came back negative. Several meds could cause those symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressants, ritalin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Also other native plants. Wormwood, jimson weed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The amount of jimson weed or ritalin he'd have to ingest, seems like he would have mentioned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Unless he didn't know about it. Maybe one of those kids at the camp got tired of Driscoll's lessons and poisoned him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Go to the camp. Check for potential poisons. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I all but ignored your assault, showed you no compassion whatsoever, but you came up with a good idea. Score one for tough love.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wells </speaker><content>Glad to hear you met someone you like. Weddings are good for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I was hoping to get in touch. The thing is, I'm a bit fuzzy on names. Sorry. Open bar. She was sitting at Dr. Simpson's table. Brunette, purple dress, low-cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Your niece?  Fantastic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wells </speaker><content>Her info is in your email. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Wells </speaker><content>You want me to hook you up with two women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Actually, three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>How do you cheat on a test when there's no test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Sorry, not playing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Go away, House.  I am not giving you advice just so you can distort it to suit your own warped world view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But it's been working so well. Cuddy wants to get Rachel into Waldenwood preschool. The problem is, Rachel's dumber than a paste sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>And her not getting in bothers you. You care about Rachel. That was not advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cuddy cares about her. When Rachel gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset. And as the boyfriend, I will be expected to be supportive and consoling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Not your strengths, I grant you. Leave it alone. It's just a play date. It'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Play date being their code for way to weed out the paste sandwiches. They'll hand her puzzles and counting games, and Rachel will just sit there and eat the pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Oh, crap! Crap! I'm such a sucker!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That's the isolation area. Kids who've behaved badly go there, sometimes 23 hours a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Sound like a pretty good incentive to behave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Yeah, by treating the symptom instead of the disease. Basic systems theory. Troubled kids are produced by troubled families. This place doesn't even attempt to change the environment that damaged them in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>So there are no bad kids, only bad parents? Then why is my brother an ex-con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Treating kids decently doesn't mean identically. Some kids need more structure or discipline. Nobody needs this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Maybe we're coming at this wrong. We find a poisoner, and let them point us toward the poison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Driscoll's got 24 kids in his troop. You want to interview all of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Maybe we don't need to.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Driscoll sent me to isolation all the time. It doesn't mean I poisoned him. He's the psycho, not me. Tell 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>MacDonald </speaker><content>D.I. Driscoll's way harder on him than the rest of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Maybe because he's a bigger pain in the ass. What are you in here for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Shoplifting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You ready to upgrade to second-degree murder? Spend ten years in jail? If he dies because of whatever you gave him, that's what'll happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>That supposed to scare me? My mom's dead, my dad's never been around. And after this, I'll get bounced to another foster home. My future's not exactly bright. Prison now or later doesn't make that much of a difference to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>MacDonald </speaker><content>Dude, I'm not mopping the whole floor by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>MacDonald </speaker><content>It's just my allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Do you take anything for them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>MacDonald </speaker><content>Not right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>These IV fluids will help flush the drugs out of your system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>You know which of the kids dosed me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's not medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Look, I'm not gonna hurt him. But I get why you're scared of me. I'm real sorry about this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>No apology necessary. You're ill. You didn't know what you were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I used to be a real screw-up. The military taught me that actions always have consequences. Part of being a man is accepting them. And after all the times I've said that to the kids, an apology is necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>My heart's kinda racing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I got it. Heart rate is 170. P.A.T. until proven otherwise, we've gotta slow it down. Six milligrams adenosine, IV bolus. Tell the nurse to get in here with the crash cart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Pushing fluid sent his heart into overdrive. It took three doses of adenosine to get it under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>House, where are you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Playground. Great place to meet chicks. Their moms too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Tachycardia could be a humoral effect — mastocytosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We'd see other GI or cutaneous symptoms. Pancreatic insulinoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It would cause bladder problems, unlike pheochromocytoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well done, Chase. Now, turn off your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You heard that? It's on vibrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No, no, no, you're right. This is in no way clever and hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Before you start rolling anyone in flour, work the patient out for a pheo. Adrenaline pituitary scans, 24-hour urine collection.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Teacher </speaker><content>How soon after the admissions session did the child get sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The kid barely got home before she collapsed. Her parents are a wreck. Desperate for answers. Have you experienced any symptoms, or does someone else oversee these sessions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Teacher </speaker><content>The teachers supervise. No one's mentioned feeling sick. I'd love to call the family and offer my support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sorry, I can't reveal names. Doctor-patient confidentiality. So this is where all the admissions play dates happen? She wouldn't have been in another room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Teacher </speaker><content>This is where we have them all. Maybe, to be safe, we get rid of these toys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, no, no, don't do that. I'll tell you if anything's toxic. For now, you should minimize your exposure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I'm supposed to be supervised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The scan is pre-programmed. There's no risk to the patient. You're literally gonna sit here, watch the monitor, and chat with him if he gets lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Uh… still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Report me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>How you doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>You shouldn't bother trying to protect Landon. I know he's the one who drugged me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The antihistamines aren't what got you sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Doesn't change the fact that he did it. I tried everything with that kid. I just… can't break through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's clear you care about him. Have you tried telling him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>You gotta understand something. These kids, they're all manipulators. As much as I care about all of them, I can't—I can't show them that unless there's some mutual respect. Otherwise…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Forget those other kids. Think about this kid. He watched his mother get sick and die. He's never known his dad. Who knows how long it's been since anyone's taken care of him, or if there's ever been a man around with any degree of consistency? I believe that you're on his side. I'm betting it would help if he did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You are a beautiful man. Can I leave now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I know where all three women are, but I'd like to avoid the additional humiliation of falsely accusing any of them. You I.D.’d the hotel off this. I'm hoping there's another clue in there somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We could enhance the image. Maybe her face is reflected in that gleam off your butt cheek. Or maybe it's time to chalk this up to the hazards of being a player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Your zipper problems just blew up your marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Don't move.  Unlike me, you've had the decency not to cheat on anyone, but you haven't been giving much thought to who these women are, how they might feel. Obviously, you hurt one of them. Emotionally, you hurt her, because physically, how would you even know? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Looks like your shorty is a shorty.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You're early. Dinner's not ready.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>All right, you little lump of clay…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Rachel. Rachel… It's a new toy. What kid doesn't like new toys?  A moron, that's who. Okay, look at the pretty colors. Now, what color is this?  Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Orange!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes, that is orange. What color is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay, blocks going away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Bye-bye blocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Next time, reinforce the levees. Bad Corps of Army Engineers. Bad! What's this?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>No, I did not. Don't deflect. That picture was taken by someone your height. Just take it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Winn </speaker><content>What picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Fine. Play it that way.  So, uh… you really like kittens, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Winn </speaker><content>Yeah. You said you did too. No wonder you're pissed. 'Cause that is not you.  And I didn't take it. Did you mean my height with heels or without?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You weren't wearing heels when we were in that room— Oh, yes, you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Winn </speaker><content>I started to take them off, and then you asked me very nicely not to. Why would I do this? I mean, I'm not mad about what happened with us. Or apparently with you and any other woman at that wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Sorry, I guess my forensic analysis wasn't as advanced as I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Winn </speaker><content>Wait. You know, you don't have to rush off. I still have those heels…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>How did you get out of there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I didn't… right away. Wasn't anything wrong with her physically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>One down, two members of the threesome to go. You should flip a condom to choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We checked his adrenal, pituitary, and thyroid glands. Monitored his catecholamines. It's not a pheo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We had to put him on a diltiazem drip to regulate his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That means he's running out of time.  It means you are too. Your campaign to soften him up so he would go easier on the kids… All in a pointless attempt to validate your own upbringing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Another cardiac arrhythmia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Not our patient. It's the ER.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Same here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We need things exclusive to you, but not the rest of the camp. Otherwise, a lot more people would be sick. Toothpaste, deodorant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Can't be deodorant making him sick. He doesn't wear any.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Doesn't mean you get to be disrespectful.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>There's gotta be a link. Diet, sexual history, drug abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No. Believe me, I asked. Those were some fun conversations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Do you believe the answers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I know the answer to that is always supposed to be no, but I did. Not like the kid has had much unsupervised time lately.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The camp is in the woods. There are tons of opportunities for infection that not every person will pick up. Legionellosis from water, toxoplasmosis from dirt, brucellosis from animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Too bad none of those explain his symptoms.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Nocardia fits. Bacteria lives in the dirt. They both—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nocardia starts in the lungs, not the bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>How generous is extraordinarily generous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Call the charity. Explain the donation's a fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>And take back Wells' wedding gift? You are extraordinarily screwed. Bushes can make a happy hunting ground for ticks, Lyme disease.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>40% of Lyme patients don't develop a rash, and a bite is easy to miss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The side effects are fairly limited. And it would be better to treat you before you develop any more symptoms.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's got the fine motor skills of The Hulk in oven mitts. Do you want a doodle?  Do you? Feed the monkey. Cuddy puts her to bed at 7:30, which cuts way into our training time. Play date's on Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Dog training clicker. Gives immediate positive reinforcement, bridging the precious seconds between desired behavior and treat delivery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House, she's not a dog.  It really seems to be working.  Does Cuddy know that Rachel's here, and that you're turning her into a schnauzer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I told Marina that Rachel and I are working on a secret art project for mommy. Which means that some Peds patient is about to be short one art project.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Mackenzie </speaker><content>Would you give it up already? I told you, it's not me. My parents won't even let me on social networking sites. Too many sexual predators.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Did you stop Landon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Oh, my legs, they hurt. The muscles are in a vise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I'm not sure yet. Ten Diazepam. 40 potassium.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The leg pain was caused by a muscle cramp from low sodium, which was caused by kidney dysfunction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Landon didn't respond to doxycycline either. I think we can rule out Lyme. I thought I was getting through to him, and he just wanted to steal my car keys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If only his previous behavior had given you a reason to expect that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Why are you putting hot sauce on a toy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Maybe you don't care if children chew on your caterpillar. I think it's wrong. What causes kidney dysfunction on top of everything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Arsenic poisoning. And people do change. Driscoll took it to heart when I asked him to think about Landon's history. He was much nicer, and then—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wow, two ideas that don't make any sense. If it was arsenic, they'd be puking and pooping. And conversations with moralizing strangers do not make people change their behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Rachel is not gonna do that more than once! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Whipple's could affect the brain, kidneys, heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Not without G.I. involvement. Why is it impossible to believe I made a compelling argument, and he—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If he changed, it's because something besides you made that argument compelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Compromised kidneys secondary to bladder issues points to botulism toxin, which lives in soil. Got into the kid's bloodstream through the cut on his forehead. Got into the drill instructor’s through some abrasions on his feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Good idea. Give 'em both the antitoxin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>I saw my chance to get out of here. I had to take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Don't make excuses. You tried to steal from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Oh, these kids are manipulators. You can't let your guard down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>What do you mean "all these kids"? Don't lump me in with the losers at that camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Seems like you belong there. It may be your only chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Look, I've screwed up, but I've never been in trouble with the law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Store owner caught me trying to boost some chips and stuff. Called my DCS caseworker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content> I thought all the kids were there under court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>That's usually how it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So why is he different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Nika </speaker><content>Why would I take a naked picture of you? You're cute, but you're not that cute. Now please go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're the only one left. You're pissed off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Nika </speaker><content>I'm pissed off because you're in my apartment, and my boyfriend might be here any minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Nika </speaker><content>Last thing I want to do is publicize that I cheated on him, so why would I prank you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And where was this boyfriend at the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Nika </speaker><content>Out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Nika </speaker><content>It's from my sister's birthday last month. And before you suggest he's my brother, note how I'm kissing him. You used me, I used you. It was a mistake. Now I just want to forget about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I just got off the phone with Landon's DCS caseworker. You were right. I'm not what made my argument compelling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>To give your bladder an antibiotic wash to protect against infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm Dr. House. And that boy is the spitting image of his mother. Of course, I've never seen her, but his care worker told my lackey that you paid his enrollment fee at the camp. That could mean that you're a family friend, but then, why hide it? The only person who'd want to hide it… is his deadbeat dad, who has decided not to be a deadbeat anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Please, don't tell him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We spend days looking for a link between them, and he doesn't tell us the kid is his son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We were looking for exposures. He didn't think it was medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Soon, he won't have to worry about his kid finding out. Being dead makes keeping secrets much easier. Neither one was responding to botulism treatment, and the boy started having seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>And Driscoll might have been right that their biological relationship doesn't matter. Genetic illness emerges when people are the same age, not during the same week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Unless there's a trigger. Genetic conditions can be set off by things in the surroundings, and these two obviously share surroundings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That's a relatively rare phenomenon. Which is our specialty, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Our patients are related. That can't be a coincidence.  I just had an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Relevant to our case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wegener's can be brought on by exposure to heavy metals. Did you see anything at the camp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Near the isolation hut, there were some old generator batteries. Could have leaked into the soil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Seems like someone else in the camp would have had lead poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You got anything better? Treat with cyclophosphamide.  Go find your bliss.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a play date. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I found out she'd passed months later. By then, Landon was already in the foster system. I was figuring out a way to approach him when he got into trouble, so I-I brought him to the camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You need to tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I can't. Not now. If I die, the only thing I'll ever be to him is the hardass who made him run obstacle courses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You'll apologize to me for something done in a psychotic state, but you won't own up to being his father. What happened to "actions have consequences, a man accepts them"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>I'm in his life, and I am working to get him on the right path.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He doesn't need a drill instructor. He needs a dad.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Teacher </speaker><content>Rachel had a great time. Played with everything. She's a very clever girl.  I'm sorry to ask this, but we've had some problems with parents coaching kids. Rachel caught onto our toys unusually quickly, and she even knew the game was called "Feed the Monkey."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's not my kid. She's a pain in the ass. And she's a better liar than you are. You didn't cut your leg getting into your truck. The abrasion has dirt and gravel in it.  A bit of fertilizer too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Man </speaker><content>Tripped in my greenhouse. Growing my own organic veggies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Didn't ask. Not gonna tell.  She didn't hesitate. She didn't oversell. Took me years to learn how to lie like that. And Rachel has it on instinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Man </speaker><content>Sounds like you're real fond of that kid.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nice stitches. Do they hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>No. They gave me a shot of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That was Lidocaine. It triggered an underlying genetic condition called variegate porphyria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That would explain their symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>But I didn't have any Lidocaine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But you had a handful of antihistamines, courtesy of the deviant in the next bed. It's also a porphyria trigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Wait, so we have the same genetic thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah… small world. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>This is good news. We can manage the condition with hematin. A liver transplant could cure it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Sometimes two patients share one donated liver. Would that work for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Possibly. We'd have to test your blood, tissue type. And if they matched—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>Landon </speaker><content>Why would they? Just because we have the same thing making us sick…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>Driscoll </speaker><content>Also… I'm your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You don't think a white guy can be a bad father? Happy to check your DNA. Do you really think he'd say he's your dad if he isn't? It's not like you're a catch. </content></utterance>
