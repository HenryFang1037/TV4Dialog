<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content> Am I gonna have to give a speech? You're the publisher. Can't you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Elaine</speaker><content>I can warm them up. But you are gonna have to get over this fear of public speaking before the book tour. Everybody. Can I have your attention? Thank you. Tim has a few words to say. There you go, Tim. They're warmed up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Well, what do you say at a time like this? Seriously, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> You could thank people for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Thank you, Nick. Actually, I’m always thanking Nick, a man famous not only for his ruthless editor's pen, but his patient hand-holding of crazy authors. You'd think that after three novels, I'd start to develop a little confidence, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Elaine</speaker><content>For a book like this, we are happy to supply the confidence. Best-seller. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Well that's not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Come on. Short stories don't make money. Short stories weren't making money back in 1908. You'd have to be mathematically illiterate to think they'd do as well as a novel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Elaine</speaker><content>Okay, Nick, let's step away from the champagne before somebody gets hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>You slaved over this book right next to me. Why would Northrop even publish it if it's only going to tank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Have you failed to notice you're our star author? Obviously, Elaine wouldn't want to offend you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content> Uh, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I -- I'm sorry. I don't — I don't know why I said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Elaine</speaker><content>He's joking. Nick knows as well as anyone what you have done is art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>So is folding paper into animal shapes, but you don't expect to make a living off it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Elaine</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> You really think someone who goes through ten assistants a year and doesn't return her own children's phone calls would give a damn about the state of the American short story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>Please, be quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> I think something's wrong. That title was a mistake too. People are gonna compare you to Salinger, and , boy, are you gonna come up short on that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>Honey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Call 911. Help! We need help!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Cameron brought this up from the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's Phineas Gage, the most famous case study in medical history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're telling me this patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. No trauma, but he does have frontal lobe disinhibition. Just like Gage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Gage was a different person after the spike. Argumentative. Impulsive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whereas our guy became a different person after Chardonnay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was sober when they brought him in. There's also the nosebleed, the collapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> MRI show anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. What fun would that be? So the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood. It's cool neighborhood adjacent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>A well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity eroding into the brain could do the damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose. See what you find. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Marika</speaker><content>Daddy, I'm always gonna win if you keep telling me what your cards are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Well, then suppose I tell you… while I tickle you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub. This is Dr. Kutner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We're here for another test. Sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>You don't look sorry. Um, no offense. Although you do look kind of cheerful. It's a little creepy. Should I want a doctor who's excited about how sick I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I'm not —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're going to put this up your nose, scan for any problems. I can assure you that we are completely unexcited about that.  Excuse me, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content> Hold on.  She has an auditory processing disability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Marika-beleeka, you have to get off the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> This might be slightly uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>Honey, do you mind if I step out? I have to make sure the final arrangements are in place for the breast cancer walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Yeah, you do that. I'll pretend to be macho while a guy stuffs three feet of plastic up my nose.  It's too bad it's not your nose. Lots more room to maneuver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>I guess the walk can wait ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Or in a sensible world, even longer. Just how does tying up traffic for six hours stop breast cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>You know how it works. People donate —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Why not spend six hours building houses for habitat for humanity? Or is it wrong to help two groups of people at once? I bet there are those who have breast cancer and no home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>It's my job, Nick. You walked yourself last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>To be supportive. And because I knew you wouldn't have sex with me if I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>I'm gonna make my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Make this go away.  God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wednesday night. Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me rephrase. Low-down-blue-meanie —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I understand monster truck code. Do you understand "can't"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not when it follows "low-down-blue-meanie." Is the world coming to an end Tuesday night? Otherwise, Wednesday—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>All right, it's not "can’t." It's "don't want to." The fact is, I just don't like monster trucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You've always liked monster trucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you've always liked them. I've tolerated them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not hiding it. I'm saying it loud and proud. Death to monster trucks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No nasal cancer. And no marriage either if our patient keeps saying everything that comes into his head without regard for the consequences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You always led me to believe you were one of a kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Luckily jerkiness is a temporary condition for this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it's not. We may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But he's also gonna be the guy who doesn't say them. If he spent his whole life constructing this nice guy persona, isn't that as much who he really is as anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You would argue that. You're all persona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I agree with Wilson. This guy's a Harry Potter.  The sorting hat was going to put Harry in Slytherin based on his nature. He refused, so he ended up in Gryffindor, through choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's damage somewhere in his brain. Go find it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Are you sure you understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>No, I'm lying. Except I can’t.  You ask questions. While I talk, you look at my brain activity to see where it's screwed up. Then you're gonna cut the screwed up part out to test it. It's depressing, but it's not rocket science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think he understands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> I don't mean to be abrasive. Especially since you're such a pleasure to image naked. Again, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Thank you for understanding. I do, you know. Really, my apologies. This stuff just comes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House paged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Whoa, I would do her in a minute with fudge and a cherry on top. Would someone please explain to this woman? There's only so many apologies —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He has frontal lobe disinhibition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> I've already embarrasssed myself with one doctor, whom I am at this moment imagining, with you in a king-sized bed, with a mirror on the ceiling. I am so, so sorry. But if I couldn't have both of you together, you would definitely be my first choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>It's like trying not to think of an elephant. Not that you're an elephant. Your breasts, in fact, are all homo sapiens —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> House isn't here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, he wouldn't have paged me if he couldn't watch and enjoy the—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That was for my benefit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're 40 years old…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>38.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The administrator of a hospital…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dean of medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People don't get personal with you. Except for me, and you dismiss me as a jerk who's jerking you around.  But that guy can only tell the truth. And he prefers your body to that of a smoking young hottie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So that was your way of saying I look good today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't get the slightest kick out of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Don't be ridiculous, House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I hope you know your pistons are second to none.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm okay. I'm not jealous of Cuddy’s pistons.  Starting baseline activation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You sure? You looked upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What he was saying was obnoxious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You've never been called attractive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He didn't call me attractive. He cast me in his mental porno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> That's what attractive means. It means "I'm attracted to you, sexually."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Attracted can also mean "I'm attracted to the whole package, to who you are."  Slight elevation at transaxial 60.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It could. It never does. It's what women choose to hear, not what men say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Actually, it's exactly what men say if they have any brains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>All right, we have enough for a baseline. What can we ask him that's indiscreet, but that he won't hate us for knowing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Nick, do you vote the same way as your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> God, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Good. He's spiking at 30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>She believes I voted for Hillary Clinton in the primary and Obama in the General. You're thinking I’m secretly a Republican, right? Wrong. I secretly don't vote. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Wait, you're 46, and you've never voted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Your voice is no longer attractive to me with that note of disapproval. Although I'm sure that will pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look at that.  There's a spot in the cingulate gyrus that's not lighting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>One vote makes a difference? Not mathematically true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Okay, Nick. We've got what we need. We can't biopsy that. It's too close to the brainstem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be neurosarcoidosis. At least it's treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So we give him steroids, and if we're right, we should start seeing his symptoms improve within half a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What are you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I find your strong attachment to a working democracy to be extremely sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ooh, you smooth talker.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you think my nose is too big?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Relax, he also implied my bedside manner was a little off. You don't agree with that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No one's ever mentioned your nose before? You're a plastic surgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They tell me it suits my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe. Maybe that's just the social contract. You tell me I look great. I tell you you're a people person. How can you know the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You could ask for the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> What do you think of my nose? Please tell me the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cafeteria worker</speaker><content>It's fine. It's a nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just proving a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anyone sitting here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just my persona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults. Or what they think are insults. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So that wasn't an insult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not suggesting that, like our patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive niceness. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not always nice. I'm not nice to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you know nice bores me. Hence, still nice. No, I'm suggesting that you have no core. You're what whoever you're with needs you to be. Okay, I guess that could be insulting. The interesting question is why. Why do you think the world will end in chaos and destruction if you're not there to save it? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, "James, you will grow to manhood under a yellow sun."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And why'd you lie about monster trucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I checked your appointment book. You got tomorrow night marked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing. So you thought someone might look at the book —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm playing racquetball tomorrow night, with Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would you hide that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because the world revolves around you. I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And maybe I didn't want to rub your nose in the fact that we'd be doing something you can no longer do. Because I'm nice. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>I thought you said the steroids were gonna help him. What — is it his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>EKG says heart's fine. It's gotta be the kidneys. I need to get him on dialysis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's on dialysis, and he's stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We know it's not systemic sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Chronic lymphocytic leukemia could explain brain and kidney problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The CBC showed normal white blood cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Four or five times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be diabetes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or a congenital metabolic disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Congenital disorders generally don't wait till you're 46 to manifest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So he's a late bloomer. His daughter has a neurological condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew. You're not athletic. Run to the end of the hall and back. I'll time you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust.  Gets old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters. We can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You suspected that was a trick question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But I could have said neither. Diabetes makes more sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, that's why we should not test him for it. Test the daughter. Kutner runs the nerve test. Taub, you may be right about the diabetes. Take supper away from our patient and run a glucose tolerance test. Oh, and the nurses have been working so hard. You can do the blood draws yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They have to be done every couple hours. You're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess everything. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This can become either hot or cold. As soon as it starts to feel uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Marika</speaker><content>But you don't think there's something wrong with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>No, baby, they're testing you to help daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yes, what you're doing is very important. It's like the better you do, the better we know your dad is.   I'll start with heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>I know it's not his fault. I know what he says is involuntary, but, it doesn't help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Inside, he's still the same man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We all have thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I know we all have sexual thoughts. We have ignoble thoughts. I just don't want those to be who I am to people, especially not to my wife.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>My real choices are my actions. And I've never done anything to hurt her. I've never cheated. You're kidding me. You've cheated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What? No. Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Because you look guilty as hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you serious? Of course you're serious.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I still think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Fine. I'm not playing racquetball with Wilson. I was never playing racquetball with Wilson.  I thought it would be helpful if a Department Head owed me a favor. But it's not worth this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not bad. You put on a good show. You studied up. Wilson actually booked a court. If you were really a racquetball player, you'd know that you were holding a squash racket.

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's a mild burn. Since Marika has a neurological disability like you, we needed to make sure —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>Nick, you know about her problem with auditory processing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>The therapist said Marika's test scores —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Were indeterminate. She doesn't have a disability. She daydreams. She gets below-average marks in school because she's below average. Every parent thinks their child's "above average."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Kunter</speaker><content>His wife rescues dogs. Among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the house. Our patient hates it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The dog marks his territory all over the living room. I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach. He said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's out going to jgonzalez@nymercy.net. There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology. It's a consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Secret consult, 7:00 PM.  Oh, Joan is perky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're wrong. There was a patient file attached.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was password-protected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Wilson doesn't password-protect his patient files. I'm the only one he'd expect ever to look there, and he knows there's only one patient I'd want to check on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think Wilson’s sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If Wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to Manhattan. He could pull strings here and get the best treatment.  Six articles by Gonzalez. "Managing suicidal thoughts in oncology patients," "Suicidal ideation in children with leukemia."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't want to ask this, but, have you ever had reason to think he might be depressed?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We'd need to remove the damaged area in your cingulate gyrus, but it's too close to the brainstem to risk surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The brain stem controls the body's involuntary systems. The slightest mistake could kill you. Even if you survive, you may never be able to breathe on your own again. You may never—</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you. You could have come back, but you didn't. You chose to be uncomfortable. Now, why would someone choose that? Because they hate themselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Has it ever occurred to you that when I don't share something, it might not be meant as a challenge? It might just mean that I'd like there to be one molecule of my life that goes unexamined by Gregory House. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It made me think. You only snap on one subject: losing people. So I went back to the intel. It's true there's only one doctor named Gonzalez at New York Mercy, but there's a Javier Gonzalez who's a nurse in the psych ward. And who could you lose who'd end up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Daniel Wilson.  Once you got a name, it's amazing how much stuff you can learn on the phone. I mean, if you're a doctor and you lie freely. They found your brother sleeping in the lobby of an office building in Manhattan. Got aggressive when they asked him to leave, and the cops took him to the Mercy psych ward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There have been new anti-psychotics developed since he ran away. He's been on them for a couple of days, and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why wouldn't you tell me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, you and I… We don't have the normal social contract. I don't expect you to tell me the lies —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I mean, collaborative lies. Giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves, just a little.  For two days I've been thinking about how Danny’s gonna react when he sees me. If I said that to anybody else, they'd say, "don't worry, it’ll all be all right." You wouldn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it might all go horribly wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yeah. Yeah, it might. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>V-tach. Get me the paddles.  Clear.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Echo says his heart is structurally fine, but his temperature is still dropping. He's headed for hypothermia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I can't reach House. It just goes to voicemail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It means we were wrong about infection. His temperature's just going up and down because something's playing with his thermostat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Which means the brain damage is spreading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What causes brain damage and nosebleed and involves the lungs, heart and kidneys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cancer? We could text him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not cancer. Normal PSA, normal blood smear, colonoscopy normal. Do a full body scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House hates full body scans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House isn't here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House is right. Everybody's got three or four meaningless anomalies that'll come up on a scan. Chasing each one will take time we don't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Feel free to send him an IM.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>13 years ago. I used to go to Princeton whenever I could. I must have hit every homeless shelter in town. And then one day, I’m just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich, I look out the window, and there he is. He was gone by the time I got outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a small abdominal aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Irrelevant. What else you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cyst in the pleura around the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Also irrelevant. Couldn't cause any of the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a density in the liver. Could be a vascular malformation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If he's got multiple AVMS, screwed-up blood flow would explain everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can only spot them with angiography. We'll have to do targeted scans with contrast and then embolize each one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Can we do that before he freezes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We'll find out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The spell-correct on Kutner’s phone has got a hair trigger. Either that, or the patient has a “cyclone in the floral of his lungs.”  You took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you were punishing yourself. I think you wanted to feel what it would be like be homeless in a New Jersey winter. That tells me, guilt. That tells me, something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The schizophrenia started when he was a teenager. When he was in college… He was on meds, but he'd still think a professor was out to get him because he got a B, or he'd fight with his roommates because he never showered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Med school. He, called me, every day. Talked for hours. I didn't have hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. Later for that. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was tired of being the guy that everybody counted on, so one night, Danny called — One night, Danny called, crying, upset about something. I had to study for an exam. So I — I hung up… Took my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wonder how that turned out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My mother called me the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind. Which I knew meant that he would never be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down. And because we're wired to find meaning in semi-random events, you decided never to be that careless again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't think that's a little facile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I don't. I think you did it consciously. You developed your people-pleasing talents  the way an Olympic athlete develops his muscles. Talk about an overreaction to a single event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It was a pretty big event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hanging up the phone? That's what you're blaming all this on. That's the behavior you've been trying to correct. As though nothing else went wrong in your brother's life. Of course, he overreacted too but…  His glucose was normal? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Since this is a significant moment in my life and all, I… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I think I'll just go in then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Explain that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'd given him steroids. His glucose should have been elevated. That wannabe cyst you found in the whole body scan; without the glucose, it's an irrelevant cyst. With the glucose, it's a relevant fibroma. He has Doege-Potter syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-33"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>His fibroma is secreting human growth hormone, which acts like insulin, lowering his glucose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It doesn't explain the organ failure or the brain damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This whole thing is an overreaction. That one small fibroma. It's benign, but his body's acting like it's an invader. His antibodies went to war against it and got carried away, attacked his other systems. Take out the fibroma, he'll be a happy hypocrite again in no time. </content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Maybe I should call a cab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Your wife's probably just late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Yeah.  I'm sorry about… You know… the things I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I have a conspicuous nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>It suits your face. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content> I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic.  I have some good news. I was gonna tell you, and then you got sick. It didn't seem like the best time. I've been offered a better position. I'd be coordinating cancer awareness walks in three cities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>That's great. Congratulations! I know you've worked hard for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Is Marika okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Audrey</speaker><content>I'm sure she's moved on.  Kids are so resilient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll be seeing Danny again next week. I'd like you to meet him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. He sounds interesting.  Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I thought seeing him again would change everything. It would be wonderful or terrible. Instead… we're just strangers. It's kind of, anticlimactic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is better than terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it bother you that we have no social contract?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> My whole life is one big compromise. I tiptoe around everyone like they're made of china. I spend all my time analyzing: What will the effect be if I say this? Then there's you. You're a reality junkie. If I offered you a comforting lie, you'd smack me over the head with it. Let's not change that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, see, this — if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because… It makes me feel better…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is kind of fun watching you torture yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you think things will work out with my brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thanks, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do actually like monster trucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
