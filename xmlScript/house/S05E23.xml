<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Maury</speaker><content>It’s exactly the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>Then slow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Choreographer</speaker><content> Everything all right, Jeremy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>Sure. Ready when you are.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Female Staff Member</speaker><content>He can’t talk to the conductor like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Choreographer</speaker><content>No, he can’t.  She could.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>Fine, unless you mess up the timing.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Are you going to ignore me all day, again? I help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You tried to kill Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Doing what you wanted. That’s all, boss.  I exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you don’t. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Saying it is one thing, living it is another. You’re not rational.  Not completely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Put the phone on the receiver, send the hookers home and get dressed. We’ve got a case.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Twenty-one year old star of the New York Ballet collapsed on stage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I’m taking a personal day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cuddy said get your ass in or you’re fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>She’s not gonna fire you? If you don’t go to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>How long do you figure until I just… disappear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hold on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No tumors or punctures in the lungs. No bruising. No sign of trauma. No STDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And supplemental oxygen’s only gotten her saturation level to 60. Lungs keep collapsing despite a chest tube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ER ruled out the obvious. White count and temp are normal so no pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Coffee’s burnt. Thirteen’s wearing cherry-flavored lip gloss. Foreman’s staring at you. Any of that helpful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>STD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We just said the tests were negative. You think we should…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>She’s a dancer. What about dehydration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What about a pulmonary contusion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>CT showed no inflammation on the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>What about dehydration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Hey. I’m just the irrational part of your brain but elevated means high, right? Dehydration could hide an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We’re like Magic and Kareem. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mr. Pietramala, you have kidney cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Pietramala</speaker><content>Wow. Is that a bad one? I mean, they’re all bad, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The door was closed for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, now it’s open for a reason. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Pietramala</speaker><content>He just told me I have kidney cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then you’ll obviously need a moment to process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m hallucinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m… I’ll be right back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check everything I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can’t treat patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s gotta be sleep apnea. I get a good night’s sleep and I still feel exhausted. Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you have any other neurological symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Aphasia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Memory loss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Irritability?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah! That one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Don’t deflect. He cares about you. You care about him. Tell him you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You shouldn’t be practicing. At least…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enough!  Don’t give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Who were you talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone who’s not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your mind made a choice. It means something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>You know he’s just going to keep asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kutner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Good choice. He feels bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You gonna help me or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I could eat from this place seven days a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We practically do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You can order tomorrow night. Do you want some wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, thanks.  I have my husband’s sperm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your dead husband’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We froze it when he got diagnosed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And you kept it? All this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I used to think if I didn’t find anyone, then…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You found someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know. But…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if it goes wrong? What if I turn out to be a radical anarchist with a secret family and that I age backwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nobody plans on getting divorced. I didn’t plan on my husband dying, but he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So you’re saying you want a prenup, in liquid form.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What if it’s not sleep apnea? Trauma from your motorcycle accident? Vicodin abuse? You need to be admitted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> I know you’re wrong about sleep apnea which means you know you’re wrong about sleep apnea. You’re scared. Tell him you’re scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Can’t sleep with you here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you see someone standing beside me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then, no. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>So, what’s next on your list of things it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Patient’s not responding to the antibiotics. Still can’t breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So run a test to confirm it’s pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can’t do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trans-tracheal aspiration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s basically water boarding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It is pretty radical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It’s a great idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Somewhere between regular and you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Our patient can’t breathe. Either do the test or come up with a better one.  So, we’re down to infection, trauma, MS, schizophrenia, pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Schizophrenia usually manifests younger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s why it’s further down the list. We can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>An infection can be treated. Cured. Means you still got a job. Means you still got a life. Doesn’t make it a better idea, just a nicer one. This the rational you talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Can’t do this on my own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When we inject the water it’s going to feel like you’re drowning, but it will be over in a few seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penelope</speaker><content>Then it will be better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Hold her shoulders down a little.  Ready?  You’re doing great. Here comes the liquid.  Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I slipped. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her skin came off.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her skin is sloughing off faster than we can replace it with the artificial skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The ANA was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Focus on the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want us to ignore the fact that she’s lost 80% of her skin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We know it’s not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can’t just ignore the skin. It’s obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>By doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I prescribed antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Toxic epidermal necrolysis. That’s a one in a million reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where the hell were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I do have a practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I feel guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn’t do anything wrong. You prescribed antibiotics. Any other doctor would have done the exact same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn’t make any sense. Unless there’s something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Guilt as a symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative… I have to apologize. If I feel better then you’re right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penelope</speaker><content>They found a mass in my liver. Cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>They said that they think they can treat it and that the skin is starting to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penelope</speaker><content>I’ll be able to dance again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> She’s half dead and she’s wondering if she’ll ever plie again? Healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I treated you for an infection before confirming that you had one. That’s why you lost your skin. I know you’re in pain. I know that I caused it. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Very nice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Jeremy</speaker><content>Thank you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Maybe you didn’t mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Couldn’t. The artificial skin was too thin. She’d bleed out. Why were you talking to the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Did you just check with Wilson again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.  I felt nothing. It’s MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Apologies aren’t supposed to make you feel better. They’re supposed to make the other person feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In order to make you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fine. You want to do an LP to confirm or is guilt enough to start filling prescriptions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Last mass about a centimeter to your right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A short burst of flutter. We’re almost done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Entering the right hepatic vein. Cameron kept her dead husband’s sperm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She doesn’t like yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She likes his better. Or at least she wants to hang on to it in case mine is… unfaithful or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Advancing two centimeters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You gotta let her do it. If you don’t, you’ll be stuck with her forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I want to be stuck with her forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She married a dying guy. She has issues. You cannot leave her ever, for any reason because then you’re not just the guy who left her; you’re the guy who killed her kids.  That’s not a good rhythm. Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Narrow complex tachycardia. She’s gonna crash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Liver biopsy was negative for cancer but the procedure sent her heart into a-fib.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We don’t know it was the biopsy that caused the heart problem. Maybe the heart caused the lungs to collapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why is Wilson here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were looking for cancer. I thought it would be helpful for </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We didn’t find cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. Which you reported to me five seconds ago. Thought I’d let him finish his hors d’oeuvres before getting the bouncer to take care of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Until we regulate the heart we can’t get meaningful pictures so we can’t tell…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Metoprolol can correct irregular heart…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tried it. Didn’t work. Is Cuddy making him oversee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Heart’s too irregular for MRI. Other scans wouldn’t …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then you’re making him oversee your choices. You don’t trust yourself. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson. Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do I need your approval to throw you out?  You happy now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There’s only times her heart’s going to be still for our pictures and that’s when she’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It’s not MS. Severe mental illness and Vicodin are all that’s left. Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine. Vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you saying we should kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we stopped her heart we could get our pictures and then restart it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What if we can’t restart it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then she stays dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We restart hearts all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’ll take four minutes to MRI her entire heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And we only have three minutes until there’s brain damage. Sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it. I think it was her idea. Pneumonia was her idea and almost killed my patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Ooops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kutner was secretly a woman. That’s why he killed himself.  It’s Amber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It raises questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It answers questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares? I’ve got competing ideas. They can’t both be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s on the upper end of you radical. Do you have any alternative?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then you’re as safe as you can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great.  You get the LP results back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s a big shock. You don’t have MS. But while I had your blood sample, I checked your Vicodin levels. Way too high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need the pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Not an argument. He knows that’s not an argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It could still be schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, if you’re on anti-psych meds, you’re not going to be able to practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’d prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’d prefer something that could actually work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re rationalizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>No kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I know that you’re afraid of the pain, but electoshock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Heart attack, stroke, seizure, death or worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Worse? Double-death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You live but you damage the only thing you care about. Your rational mind.  I’ll make some calls.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Penelope</speaker><content>I’ll actually be dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just your heart. Just for a little while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Penelope</speaker><content>Hopefully.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Stop having ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Insulin shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes. That’s marginally less dangerous than ECT. Puts you in a coma, could cause…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you had psychosis, which you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, except the “I see dead people” thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve been popping pills for years. I’ve only been seeing things for days. Something changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Vicodin addiction is still more likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, we’re no longer dealing in absolutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, I’ll be up in five minutes. Then we can talk about how you’d rather be in a coma than in rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, if you could be up here in two, that’d be really helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I’m about to put myself into insulin shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Left atrium is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Left coronary artery also fine. We’re almost at three minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Chordae tendineae clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Right atrium is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I got to start her back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We have some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’re over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Right coronary artery is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The three-minute threshold is a guideline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She might have less. We have to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s that by the aorta?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m restarting her heart.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I need glucose in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You could have died. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It worked. Where are my pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you sure? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s been everywhere I’ve been for days.  She’s not here, ergo…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This was not the next rational step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now who’s being biased? You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted…  Forgot how to do my zipper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Any other neurological deficit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t seem to annoy me as usual. I’m not sure that’s a deficit.  And, I’m all better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is she really gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things. I check out, don’t I?  Damn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He didn’t see anything. He saw an artifact on the monitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was a shadow on her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’d already been technically dead for three minutes. I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any brain damage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. And all tests indicate that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously had more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Best of luck. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume we can’t kill her again and take more pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uhhh. You’ll wanna check with Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It’s something. A lesion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Tumor? Scar tissue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be an abscess infection. Explains why it’s invisible in the blood. It’s doing its damage behind closed doors, sealed off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, the problem with speculation is you make a speck out of you and some guy named “Lation” which really doesn’t affect me at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We have to guess. It’s all we’ve got. We can’t do a biopsy. The last time we went into her heart she had a major cardiac event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which just leaves…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The picture doesn’t change. She lies there in pain. He sits there, worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing changes.  I just had an epiphany. All by myself. Popped into my head out of nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Care to share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s too devoted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Too devoted? You think he feels guilty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. I’m being cynical. People can care because they care, not because they cheated. Theoretically true. But gonorrhea fits better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. No STDs. We tested her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tested her blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That is the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not where her problem is. Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart. Got walled off in an abscess, it’d be invisible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And it would look like a shadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No need to test her again when we can check Prince Charming. Once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Here are your onion rings, extra well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you, Molly. And another beer when you get the chance. I’m celebrating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank goodness.  Don’t tell me, I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And everyone’s a winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s not too happy about it. He insists he’s never cheated, must have gotten it from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Timing would fit. He’s got no symptoms and she’s dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lying would fit too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s not hanging out in her room anymore.  What does it matter? You were right. We’re prepping her for surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I saw guilt in him. If he’s not actually guilty, then I wasn’t right. I was lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, you made a brilliant deduction about her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And if I was just lucky…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think. Enjoy yourself, while you’re still in the pink. The years go by  as quickly as a wink. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. It’s later than you think. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson. Come get me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I know a nice facility outside Philly. I went to undergrad with one of the directors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many shirts do I need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They said three. They have laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Like living with Mom again. Delightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s probably Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s unavailable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Tell him the infection’s made her septic. We can’t remove the abscess until we get her BP up and it’s not responding to fluids, it’s not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s off the case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patient okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>He’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don’t I feel scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’d say you’re unaware of what you’re feeling at this moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I feel like crap. My life if falling apart, but I don’t feel scared. Not of the rehab, anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We’ve always been able to find a way to cheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It won’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want it to work this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Do we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, it’s your only option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do I do if my only option won’t work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don’t give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. It’s either that or electroshock every six hours. Good night, Wilson.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What if we put her on a heart-lung machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She’s septic. We don’t need a heart-lung machine. We need a blood-vessel-holder-together machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could try high-dose dopamine. It’s a vasoconstrictor. It’ll close the blood vessels so she won’t bleed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her heart can’t take that much dopamine. It’ll explode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And, if we don’t use the dopamine, it’ll implode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is House really done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It sounded that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dopamine it is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Great. My nanny is off the clock at 7:30 so your week off, bigger desk, tighter nurses’ uniforms or whatever other stupid thing you’re about to demand is going to have to wait until…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Coffee cup. On the top shelf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That was a test. I already did the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Nicely played. She’ll think you’ve come clean and given her everything. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We were able to successfully remove the abscess from your heart but the dopamine caused the blood vessels in your hands and feet to clamp shut. We need to amputate or the gangrene will spread. You’ll die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bold idea, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe we can get the boyfriend to convince her to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah. Boyfriends get everything they want.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Home. The case is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, it’s not. Not until we come up with something that might work. It’s a shame that she might die because House has some personal crap to work through.</content></utterance>
