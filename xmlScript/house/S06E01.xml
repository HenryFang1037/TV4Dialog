<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dry heaves are gone, so am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Valdez</speaker><content>I’ll check with the doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. I’m here voluntarily. Just got to check with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Valdez</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Dr. Nolan left specific instructions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>She’s not sick. She’s scared. So tell her to tell –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wow.  And he’s black. I thought you’d be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t keep me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Dr. House, you look a lot better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am a lot better. No painkillers. No hallucinations. Leg hurts, but it’s manageable. Great job. Gonna miss you. Want to start missing you as soon as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Well, legally, you’re free to go whenever you want, but I suggest you stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll take it under advisement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>If you thought the hallucinations were from your Vicodin problem, why didn’t you just check yourself into a rehab facility?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>But you had been abusing Vicodin for years. Never had delusions. Never had trouble sleeping. Never had any problems other than narcissism and antisocial behavior, until two colleagues died. Your father died. Your issues run deeper than Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that’s not gonna cheer me up, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You need to be transferred to our long-term ward, started on medication, talk therapy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I get it. Uh, just one thing I’m getting hung up on. I can leave whenever I want. How ‘bout I start with that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You can’t go back to practicing medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don’t want to practice medicine. I’ve decided I want to be an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Well, if you want your state astronaut’s license, you’re gonna need my recommendation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that a popular new treatment – blackmail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You need to get better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Orderly</speaker><content>Welcome to Ward Six.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, brass tacks… What do I have to do, and how long do I have to be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Depends on you. Process is pretty basic. If you follow the schedule, agree to take meds, participate in group and individual therapy, we can work on goals –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I set a goal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Excellent. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My goal is to get your boss to write the letter that I want him to write. Now let’s talk process. I can smile through gritted teeth and play nice, but there are serious risks of violence involved in that choice so I’m going with turning this ward upside down, making you and your boss’ job and life so unmanageable that he’ll write whatever he has to write to get rid of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Safer</speaker><content>He’s all set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Ow. I’ve never been in the end unit before.  Yo, I don’t need an escort. Get off me.  Who are you? You believe these guys? Lecturing me on manic depression, like I couldn’t write a book or two. I stop taking my meds because I want to stop taking my meds, because nothing is wrong with me. No reason to keep dragging me back here. When I’m on them, everything slows down. That’s when the problem is. Hey, nice to see you. My roommate last time couldn’t stand me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>I’m Juan Alvarez. J.A.’s my stage name, but Alvie’s what everybody around here calls me, like the Woody Allen character in, uh, Annie Hall, but the Puerto Rican version and not as neurotic. So what do I call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you’re actually waiting for an answer this time. You can call me House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Ow!  He’s a brick, wah wah wah wah, House. Buh buh dum dum.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Hey, wait up. I’ve already got the whole place wired so I’ll give you the rundown.  Yo, everybody! This is my new roommate, House, y’all.  Main thing you gotta know –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is this the line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Hey, Gabby, meet my new roommate, House. You can call him “Heezy.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Don’t worry. She won’t call you anything. She hasn’t talked in, like, ten years or something. Good you came here. You need to know the lay of the land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I need to request a new room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Ha. Ha. You’re funny. You’re also gonna come here to get your meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not on any meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You either? Good for you. Tell me my mind works too fast. Probably tell Usain Bold he runs too fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excuse me. I know you’re busy ignoring me, but my minibar is empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You think Bolt could do the long jump? That sport needs to evolve. Had the same world record for, like, 20 years. I think if one guy launched himself headfirst and right before he hits the ground does a front flip instead, get three extra feet out of that, easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go be that man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Hal</speaker><content>Ahhhhh! Ow, my head. Gahhh. My head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Safer</speaker><content> You’re not getting any Haldol. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>That’s Hal. His real name is Connor, but we call him Hal because he –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>We can’t play that. They keep it locked up. I wish we could, but at the same time, you can imagine how annoying that could be. Crazy people playing on it all the time. We’d never get any peace. Come on. I want to introduce you to everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Do you think he’s serious? He’s a doctor. He knows that acting out will only reinforce our diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content> Or it’ll work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>You actually think this is something we should be concerned about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>A patient makes a threat, you should always be concerned.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>There are two new additions to our ward. You all know Alvie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Thank you, thank you. Hold your applause. It’s great to be back here in Mayfield. Not just for the food. Not just for the ladies –  Well, okay, maybe just for the ladies. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>And you should also welcome Greg to the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t worry about the name. I’m just passing through. Don’t want to break any hearts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Not now, Jay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he’s claustrophobic, right?  You’re claustrophobic?  Can I get a pen to write this stuff down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Where are you going?  Where’s he going</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Paranoid. Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Hal</speaker><content>Dr. Beasley. I am having an issue with the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Hal</speaker><content>I swear I’m eating less and less, and I just keep getting bigger and bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A crayon? Anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>We’ll talk about it another time. I understand you all had art therapy yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Maybe we can hang some of the new pieces on the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cut your wrists, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Greg, there are certain topics –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, I’m sorry. Is suicide taboo? Gosh, if I’ve broken a rule on my first day, I will kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Group’s over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That flew by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>You realize you’re not the first uncooperative patient on this floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Is there a club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Yes.  Come with me to the clubhouse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Orderly</speaker><content>That didn’t take long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m that good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Come on, Alvie! Let’s see some action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Oh! You got nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Me! Me! Me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Pass, pass, pass! Good.  Come on, guys!  Ready to play nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you believe me if I said “yes”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>You do know I’m trying to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I also know you’re trying to be sweet, caring and effective. You’re just not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>You want out.  Just talk. Be honest. Try to work with people. Try to deal with people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>House, House! He’s on my team!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shut up. Nobody likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Am I crowding you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t see the sun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, no! Everything is closing in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He’s the claustrophobic one, right? ‘Cause I’m doing this from memory. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>You have to dribble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? The CIA satellites aren’t watching me. They’re watching you, ‘cause you’re wearing green.  That one was just too easy.  Seriously, anorexia? What, are you supposed to be a girl? And, in answer to your implicit question, yes, those pants do make you look fat.  How upset were you when you woke up in the ER and you were still alive and a failure? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Whoo-hoo. Two-nothing. Good, guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re right. It is rewarding when you reach out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>You can’t go up there. It’s yard time now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put it on my tab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you’ll find music therapy’s more effective if the patients are inside to hear it.  Where’d you get the key?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> They gave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So, if she ever talks, are we gonna get a German accent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> No. She’s, um, my husband’s sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So let him come play the piano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>He doesn’t know how to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice. You’re a little heavy on the right foot, though. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>See her head? It bobs to the music. It’s the only real reaction I’m getting from her.  It feels like… we’re talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not talking.  Her head is bobbing to her pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Are you a new doctor on the ward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Technically, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can I lead this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Orderly</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Leave the lid unlocked when you’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can you close the door? You’re letting all the cool air out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>If you keep up this scorched-earth policy, you’re gonna end up living in this room. Are you ready to try another strategy, or do you want me to leave you in here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Twenty-one. Two one. That’s game. Hey, House is back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Diane</speaker><content>I’ll get the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Come on. I need some meat. I got no one left to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Diane</speaker><content>I’ll play you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Girl! Come on, House. You can serve. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve had some time to think about the approach I’ve been taking.  I’m new, unhappy here, and I’ve been taking it out on you guys… unfairly. It was… misdirected anger.  ‘Cause when you think about it, the real jerks here are the doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See how they give you a ping pong table, but no paddles. No net. It’s like they’re mocking you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Preach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The game is called table tennis, not table volleyball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content> Greg, you know where this is gonna end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who ever saw a tennis court without a net?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Little run-down park across from my apartment growing up. Three courts, no nets. No one ever used it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No one’s gonna try to hang themselves with a ping pong net.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Hal</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>It ain’t right, doc. You treat us like little kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, little kids are allowed to play ping pong and they can play the piano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Yeah, worse than little kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>All right, why don’t we just go and sit down and discuss it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Hal</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. I want to discuss it right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Guys.  Guys.  Guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>We want our paddles. We want our paddles. We want –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>House is right.  I think everyone here can handle these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously? Is that your strategy? Give everybody what they want except me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You’re a natural leader. You could do something useful down here, for them, definitely for you. Or we could… keep fighting. If you think you can break me, if you think I’m not every bit as stubborn as you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Came to fight the man and he had the master plan, but it started to unravel, Nolan smashed him with his gavel like BLAH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>So you gonna keep trying to make them miserable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>New plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> His mind is burning, the wheels are turning, the butter is churning. You think Nolan can keep House from strolling? –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, it’s easier to come up with a new plan in silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Right. Cool.  Can I hum?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>I’d like you all to welcome another addition to our ward. Steve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>Uh Freedom Master. Steve Elkerton is just a cover. It’s like Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Coooool. We got more Jesuses than superheroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>Well, I try to blend in in the outside world, but I figure in here, everybody gets it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Hey… We’re living in the Ward of Justice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Alvie.  Can you explain a little more about what you think everybody gets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>There’s good and evil in the world. And some people are – are special, and they’re chosen to help keep evil forces at bay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>You don’t think you can stop bullets, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>I move out of their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Can you read minds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Group time, Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>Why isn’t she talking?  She needs help. She needs somebody to save her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>That’s what we’re all trying to do. Let’s take five minutes. Everybody get to know Steve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>I can fly. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content> I know you’re scheming. Working on your next elaborate plan to get out of here. Why don’t you put the plan on hold for a few days? See what happens. Just let me do my job. If you prefer private to group, we can do that, maybe try some SSRIs.  If you think nothing’s working, you can always go back to your schemes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God, if only you’d said that two minutes ago, before I came up with my new scheme. Now I’m committed.  Ha! Get it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Huh. Shaq up in my area. I’m a better baller and a better rapper.  What? And I’m good at basketball too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do you have third floor privileges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Ever since I shared in group about my uncle fondling me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Yeah. And now I can use the third-floor vending machines.  You eat sour cream and onion chips? I mean the whole point is the dipping. Sure, we save time by not adding the mix and sour cream, but you’re missing out on the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need you to break into Nolan’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Commando style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want you to focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You want me to mess him up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go into Nolan’s office. Look at his calendar. I need the name of the woman he met with at 11 today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, get me chips and dip. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>I get it, I get it. Plan “B.” “B” is for blackmail. I got you covered.  Commando style.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then we can assume the girl he’s with is called “Nooner.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Nooner, Nooner, Nolan’s gonna spoon her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s gonna fork her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>And then he’s gonna knife her.  I didn’t get a chance to check the phone or anything else.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You got to be at level five. That’s like the top of the Space Needle. Hal’s the only one that’s up that high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hal’s at level five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>They give him a point every time he clears his plate. I’ve been eating his potatoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Will he sell you some minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>No. I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes. Phone’s worth a lot more.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Track down the owner of this car, and I’ll be able to visit you in your office tomorrow. My doctor is too smart, too old and too well-dressed to only be running one ward. He screwed up something in his life and I think he’s doing it again. I need her name so I can blackmail the blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House. House. He called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did he want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He wanted to know about you. He wanted to warn me that you’d be calling for something. And he told me if I wanted to help you get better, I had to let him do his job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I hate you. I’m gonna cooperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>That’s not much of a plan. That’s actually their plan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s not confident, Alvie. Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> No regrets, raise ten cigarettes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> Kind of tough to play and chat. A couple of weeks ago you told me playing to her was a complete waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re right. Your playing does get worse when you talk.  I assume she loved music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>She played for the Philadelphia Philharmonic – cello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if she responded to the piano, she might respond even better to the cello.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>You’ve been on meds for a while now. I’ll be checking in with you periodically to see if we need to adjust your dose. Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Can I go now? There’s a manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes, and he’s a terrible bluffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content> It’s nice to see that you and Alvie are friends again. Tell me about your fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He hit me. I hit him back. Repeat until pulpy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Alvie told me you instigated the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that tends to be the way fights work – different interpretations of the same circumstances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Very understanding attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s that tone again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>You’re smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How come every time you compliment me, it sounds like an accusation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>You’re not having any side effects from your meds, which is unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not that unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>The story about the fight isn’t adding up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don’t you stop pretending that you haven’t reached a conclusion? You don’t trust me. Actually, it’s more fundamental than that. You don’t like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>I didn’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think I’m not taking my meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. So what do you want me to do? Want me to take a urine test? Will that earn your trust?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Actually, yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>Well, is there something trapped underneath or…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>No. I just want to move it away from the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>I’m sorry. My powers aren’t for frivolous –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Just one quick lift.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> House, it’s none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’m just curious. As a doctor, What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Either he is Freedom Master, and he shouldn’t be here, or else he’s suffering from a serious and dangerous delusion that he needs to deal with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So… legit medical reasons. You’re not just trying to break the guy because he’s a little different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>He’s not different. He’s delusional.  Can you help me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content> What is she looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>You’re not a superhero, Steven. You’re just a regular person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>I can save her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>That’s okay. We’re… we’re all just regular people. It’s what we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>They stole her voice box.  They have it in there. That’s what she’s staring at. That’s what she’s staring at. She’s always staring –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Your wife is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>Good can defeat evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>Not every time. Evil people killed a lot of good people that day. You couldn’t save her. No one could save her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content>It’s in there. Her voice is in there. Her voice is in there.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not allowed to get angry? They screwed him up. And for the record, I am two privilege levels above Susan. And I got the same depression-scale score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Every patient is different. It’s not about scores and levels and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Happiness is happiness. The test is the test. Coping is coping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>And you think you’re –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely! I need to address some deeper issues, which I can do on an outpatient basis. Three hours a week? And that’s just my opening offer. If you want to counter, I’ll likely fold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“No” is not an argument. Are you trying to frustrate me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“No” again? I can cope! I’m coping. In fact…  I’m coping better than you think. I’ve not been taking my meds.  Not one. And yet, I still scored a “high functioning” on your depression test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>So your proof of your well-being is that you lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Manipulated. My proof is that I can fool the test, I can fool you, which means I am high functioning. I am sane, rational, capable. I should not be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>These are your pills from today? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not gonna take it. I’ll just cheek it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Lick it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me to lick your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I washed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Your test results were improving too regularly and too quickly. I was concerned that you weren’t taking your pills, that it was all an act, so I switched you to a placebo…  to see if your improvements would continue.  Your psych tests told me nothing, but your urine tests told me you were faking. You need to stop fighting the system. You need to let me do my job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m living in a psychiatric hospital. Staring out of the window is what we do. I assume you’ll need help carrying it up. I still got grounds privileges.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, cast aside the useless cripple. How very German of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Seriously, the thing weighs a ton with that case. I think I need a dolly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>The dolly’s probably easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eh, the dolly… already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So why do you put your life on hold to visit your sister-in-law five times a week?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You’re not even a bad person for lying about why you’re doing it.  Oh, that is impressive. That is a superhuman feat.  Why don’t you take a rest before you fly that thing up to the ward?  He’s still depressed. Give me your car keys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>You gonna dangle them in front of him to entertain him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m gonna make him feel like he’s flying. I’ll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair.  Seriously… you’re gonna say no to that? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>I think you have a good heart.</content></utterance>
