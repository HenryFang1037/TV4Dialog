Well, you know Matheson… the guy loves to hear himself talk. Yeah. Yeah. I'll meet you at the restaurant. Hey, we're going over the contracts now. I gotta get back in there. I love you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Officer Smith </speaker><content>You're getting paid to clean, not window shop, Vesky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>You calling me a thief?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Officer Smith </speaker><content>Take it easy. Just yanking your chain. Damn, it's freezin' in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Officer Smith </speaker><content>Used to think my job sucked. How much you make an hour anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Not enough.  The difference is that this job is just a temporary setback. You, on the other hand, will always be a schmuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Officer Smith </speaker><content>Yeah. Schmuck with a guaranteed pension and benefits. I'll take it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I'm sorry I'm late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>No talking about real estate tonight. I really want you to just enjoy yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Well, seeing you in that dress, I'd say mission accomplished. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Gets a little better. Wait till you see what's on underneath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Waiter </speaker><content>Fresh tako with lemon. Enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>I… ordered the appetizer special.  Oh, I thought tako was a kind of tuna. Ooh. We're so not eating this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Well, we should at least try it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Please, it's moving, Bert.  Oh, it's so gross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Actually, it's… not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Bert? Bert. What is it? What… honey, what's wrong? Someone, please call 911. Honey. Honey…</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House!  I assume you're avoiding me because of the charity gala.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>This Friday? It's completely slipped my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>So you'll be there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, I meant it slipped my mind to tell you I'm not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>What do you think it'll look like if you don't show up when I get an award?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Like I don't give a crap about awards, charities, what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>If you ever want…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I RSVPed two days ago. What, you think I'm a complete ass? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>If you were already going, why did you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Foreplay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Are you wearing my tie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Oh, I saw it in your closet, and it happened to match my shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Why were you in my closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Looking for a tie. What's the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Obviously, he wants you out of the closet for some reason. I suspect marriage, but I'm liberal that way. Now, tell me how someone can have an allergic reaction when all their tests were negative for known allergens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Environmental. File says he's a real estate developer. Could have been exposed to something visiting a construction site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He's lying.  He's not an executive. I saw his hands. They're covered with calluses and little cuts. He works with them. A lot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hmm. Baby steps. Go down there and do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>But what if I'm wrong? I'll just end up offending him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Consider that part a bonus.  All right, I'll send along one of your big brothers to help. You want scary, smarmy, or shorty?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We need to ask you a few questions. Alone.  If you don't mind.  Uh, they tend to be personal in nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>I'm his wife. I can probably answer them better than he can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>They're about his job. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Well, what does that matter? He sits in an office all day…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Honey, take a break. It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>No! Seriously, if there's something really wrong with him, I-I wanna know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Our questions are about what he eats for lunch at work and what comes out at the end… bowel movements, mostly. Color, texture. Smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Oka…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Pretty sure you can't help with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Maybe I could use a break.  Thank you for your honesty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're welcome. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I can't let my wife find out about this. You have to promise me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>That depends on if it's considered…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I lost everything because of the recession, my entire real estate company. And she has no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So what do you do for a living now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I used to be a janitor when I was in college, and now I'm almost 40 and doing it for the people I built homes for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>What do you think? Cause I need the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>No, I mean why lie to your wife about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Oh, n-none of our business, really. What kind of cleaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Industrial jobs. Crime scene cleanup. Septic tank repair.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's the holy grail of potential diseases… caustic cleaning chemicals, raw sewage, mold spores, fungal infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And not to mention cleaning up blood and other bodily fluids from a homicide yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We should check out the crime scene. He might have picked up a bacterial infection from the victim's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Place has been cleaned and sanitized by our patient. We sent for the autopsy report… probably take a week to get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>When he's not working, where does he go all day to hide out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>His old real estate office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Treat for bacterial infection. Meantime… Bert, take Ernie and check his office for environmentals. I'll talk to Cuddy about getting the autopsy results faster. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Well… at least the Alzheimer's patient in room 202 won't remember she only got half a ham sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You're really going to the charity gala?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why? I wanna do something nice for my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You never do anything unless it stands to benefit you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I realize that three failed marriages can leave a man twisted and bitter inside, but in a good relationship, people sometimes do things for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>A hundred says you don't show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I'm just making easy money. 200.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why do people believe I'm incapable of doing anything nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Experience.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's a tie. I'm not wearing your underwear. I said I was sorry. You want the tie back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Can we get to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Both. And you can keep the tie. Went out of style five years ago.  Vicodin. And he doesn't have a prescription. We didn't test for an allergic reaction to narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Or it's the obvious. Take a look at this. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We think you're suffering from boric acid exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Which is causing the rash. We need to decontaminate your skin and hope you didn't inhale it into your lungs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I-I feel like I'm… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Never seen a fever spike this fast before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Acid exposure burns literally. It shouldn't be causing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>What's happening to him? Bert? Honey, are you all right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We have to get his fever down right now. If it gets any higher, it could cause permanent brain damage.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We used cooling blankets to get his temperature down. He stabilized at 102.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Problem's not boric acid. We found no traces of it on his skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Infection from the murder victim's blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We found Vicodin in his office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Maybe we're thinking too far outside the box here. Just because he could have picked up any one of a hundred exotic diseases from his job doesn't mean he didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Taub's life partner has a point. Started treatment with antibiotics, and he got worse. Simple answer begins with "m" ends with "mia."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Meningococcemia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That works too. Confirm with a lumbar puncture. And on the off chance we're wrong, find out what else he's been lying about besides his job and his drug use.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You sure do hide a lot from your wife. Your job, your drug use. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>What does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Can't help you unless you're completely honest with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I was doing manual labor. If I came home barely able to move, Diane would know something's up. That's why I take the Vicodin… to hide the pain. I'm not an addict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Is that all you're hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I didn't just lose my job. Well, that's how it started, but I figured it'd just last a couple months. I maxed out our credit cards, took a double mortgage on the house, and I sold all of our investments. Who'd have thought the recession would last this long, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So it's Obama's fault you're lying to your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Look… I screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's too late now. I want you to roll over on your left side for the procedure. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Haven't you ever done something in a relationship you wish you could take back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>How'd you handle it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I told the truth. Eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>How'd that work out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Not well.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I need some intel on this charity event on Friday night. If I go, do I have to actually give money to charity?  I'm going. Just don't want it to suck. There has to be a way to make this fun. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Show up and behave. Problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Your problem solved. Don't you think she deserves more than a plaque and a round of applause for 15 years of running this dump?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>It's a watch, not a plaque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's a cliché. I want to make things more exciting, something she'll remember for more than ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Okay. By fun and exciting, you mean screwing this up for Cuddy so she won't even dream of asking you to go to one again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Gram stains are negative in the first CSF samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>One down, three to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I'm starving. You wanna get a bite after…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Already have plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What difference does it make? We're roommates, not a married couple. We don't have to eat every night together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>So you're saying… it's a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Yeah, it's a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I don't have plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Ooh. Shocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Are you mad because I picked you? You're stuck actually doing your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>A little hazing never hurt a med student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I doubt it ever… helped either. I'm sorry that I think our patient shouldn't be lying to his wife. I'm a woman. I guess I just have a different perspective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're sharing this unique insight that women don't like lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Uh, no, I'm sharing my unique insight that you don't respect women. You sleep with a different one every few days. Or maybe… you find meaning in meaningless relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>At least I have relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I'm seeing a high lymphocyte count in the CSF sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>And that couldn't wait until they finished mocking each other?  That means it's not meningococcemia. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>He's getting worse! He can barely move his legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I can't feel them. I can't feel my feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>What is it? What is happening to him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Luckily, he didn't lose his feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We were able to restore his circulation before any serious damage set in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's not meningococcemia. CSF was negative for bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>But high on lymphocytes. It's some kind of viral infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Serum sickness fits everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>There'd have to be a cause, some drug he's been exposed to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>In rare cases, a tick or a spider bite could set it off…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Show of hands. Who's going to this charity thing Friday night? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Already got a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cuddy is getting an award. I think we should all be there, show our support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I assume you're planning on screwing it up, so you want to maximize witnesses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why does everyone go to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Experience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Shut up! How 'bout go… or work the clinic all weekend? I hear it's genital herpes awareness month.  Serum sickness fits. Take him off the antibiotics. Start him on corticosteroids. If we're right, he'll be better by morning.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Canceled date, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You're bugging my cell phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No. I just noticed you're not wearing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You tracking my wardrobe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I'm just observant. That's why I'm good at my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It's also the reason you're starting to annoy the crap out of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Forgive me for trying to connect a little with my roommate. I just found out that Rachel is now officially more than just emotional with her online friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You're getting divorced. What did you expect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I know. You're right. Just… thinking about it kinda makes me wanna throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You still wanna get something to eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I could cook.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Ooh. That had to hurt. Not as bad as you. You just missed a free upgrade. Ha. Just did it again. You ran past the power up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Double damn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Of course I'm not letting you…  Okay, maybe a little. You're having fun, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I used to think the whole brooding thing was just part of your work persona, but now I live with you. You need to lighten up, Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>And you think I need you to show me what? How to have fun, relax?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It was working till you flipped out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>If I was gonna take advice on how to live my life, it would not be from you. You're broke, you ruined your marriage, and yet you act like you're the victim here, like somehow we're all supposed to feel sorry for you.  You screwed up your life, not some emotional friend your wife met on the… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>My stomach. You… you poisoned me! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I ate the same thing you did. How come I'm not…  Oh, dear God. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Open the door, Bert, please. Baby, talk to me. He locked himself inside. He went crazy. He hit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Bert. Open the door, Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Bert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I can't get out! Why? I can't get out! Oh, lord, oh, no! Why can't I… get out?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Skin rash is gone. But whatever it is, it obviously moved into his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He had a psychotic break. I'd say that usually indicates neurological involvement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Usually. Not always. The hallucinations stopped once the steroids we gave him cleared his system. I think that… Mm. I think we caused this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Taub tried to kill me last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The steroids probably did clear up the rash, but the rest of his symptoms are the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And now bilateral conjunctivitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Uh, excuse me. I'll be back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I… I, uh, better go check on him. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Swollen joints, high white count, fever. Conjunctivitis. Anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Uh… could be familial Mediterranean fever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Not likely. That almost always presents with abdominal pain or… diarrhea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Given his job, the skin and eye involvement, it's more likely a systemic fungal infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, we would have seen it in his blood work. Unless the saline used to recover and store the tissue samples has been shown in recent studies…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Get new blood and CSF samples using formaldehyde instead of saline. And start him and his wife on triple antifungal therapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>His wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, if he's really trying to keep her happy, I assume they've shared bodily fluids. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I hate you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You could have picked it up from your job. The… real one, not the fake one. If you had been more honest about…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>If his wife knew about his job, they both might have been more alert to the early symptoms. We could have caught it earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>That's ridiculous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>My God, sweetheart, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Whatever you're doing, it's obviously not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We think he has a systemic fungal infection. We're starting him on a parenteral antifungal regimen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It can be transferred through bodily fluids, so we have to start you on the treatment as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>A fungus? Where would he…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>it could be from anywhere. The spores can become airborne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>But why would he be the only one? No one in our neighborhood, no one in his office building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Sometimes it just happens… that way. It's hard to explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>No. It's not. I need to talk to my wife in private for a moment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What's it look like I'm doing? Auditioning a band for Friday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>So you're trying to ruin Cuddy's moment in the spotlight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I think, if you do this, your evening will end with you in your apartment alone… with a sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Muchachos, adelante. Tres, cuatro… </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>This is all for the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Yeah. Either that or… the opposite. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>If it means anything, um… I think he's honestly just trying to protect you and keep you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>She's right. He's at 101.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>Diane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We're gonna have to get your fever down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>What… what's wrong? What are you saying? I can't hear you. I can't… I can't hear anything!  Why can't I hear anything?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His hearing is almost completely gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The new blood and CSF tests were negative for spores and fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Tumor necrosis factor syndrome? Fits the conjunctivitis and painful swelling in his joints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Except it's never been documented to cause hearing loss. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Oh, no, she di'int!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>This isn't the classroom. In the real world, real doctors know that patients can have more than one thing wrong with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Zing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He was taking Vicodin. Extreme abusers can experience hearing loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Except his drug levels never got into the ototoxic zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You have a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I do. Only in the sense that you're wasting my time with a bad idea and she's wasting my time with no idea. Maybe we should hear from silent and silenter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It's probably neurological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Brain tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Or a viral infection that's reached his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I say we go with Ernie on this one. Get an MRI. Find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I'm gonna move out next week. I'd rather stay friends than be roommates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Just make sure I get my keys back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's not my fault.  : I cooked it thoroughly!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Yes and no. Yes, because it is a great honor, and no because… Well, you know the because.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You think House is going to embarrass you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, not intentionally.  Maybe intentionally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I know what you mean. I picture him doing something stupid like… hiring a mariachi band or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, actually, I could get behind that. I tried to hire one last year, but the board wouldn't let me because they thought it was too expensive. </content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Bert </speaker><content>I'm freezing.  Is… is Diane coming back? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Bedside 101… when a patient is near death, try to be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>She's not coming back. I'm not gonna lie to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What? You heard what she said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He's seizing. We gotta get him out of there. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Both his kidneys are fried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He's in a coma. He has maybe a few days left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We can try and get him on the transplant list, but in his condition and without a diagnosis, I don't see him getting selected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He wouldn't survive the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hence my previous comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What do you want us to do, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If it's a tumor, we start chemo. Bombard his head with radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Which will probably kill him in this state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And without an MRI, we don't even know if he has one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He's definitely dead if we do nothing. If I'm wrong, all we do is shave a few hours off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We'll need his wife's consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Masters will get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Probably not a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Uh, he's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, he's not. Consider this me officially booting you out of the nest.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Just wanted to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Do you even like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I put making friends and having relationships on hold so I could concentrate on studying. I always thought there'll be plenty of time for that in the future. But… now when I do want them… I can't even get a date to this charity event. If I can't establish relationships in my personal life, how will I ever do it with a patient? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Be honest with her. But if it comes down to a choice between the brutal truth and hope, side with hope. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He's in a coma. We think it's a brain tumor, and we need your permission to start treatment. Due to his current condition, the risk factor…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>You mean… it could kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's possible. But… there is still hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>Can he hear me? They say that… that people in coma can still do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Sometimes, but your husband's hearing… is fine. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Diane </speaker><content>I didn't mean any of those awful things I said. I'm so sorry. I love you, Bert. I've always loved you. I also kept a secret from you. I was gonna tell you at the restaurant… but you got sick. And I wanted to wait until you felt better. I'm pregnant, sweetheart. You're gonna be a daddy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Moved him to the ICU?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We also did a partial MRI.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Cleaning a crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Crime scene and an MRI. Still not seeing the connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We've been missing connections this entire case. Did he say anything? Did he show any signs of stress in the MRI room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He said he was cold, but it's always freezing in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cold and rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Cold urticaria causes rash, but it's almost instantaneous and not time-delayed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>And it wouldn't explain his other symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Muckle-Wells syndrome? There's only been a couple thousand documented cases in the U.S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, now there's a couple thousand and one. Fits every symptom there. We're idiots for not seeing it before. Treat with rilonacept. He'll live a long and healthy life filled with lies to his wife and future child.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Exactly! Why? Because love and happiness are… nothing but distractions. The only thing my relationship with Cuddy has done for me is make me a worse doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>My happiness is being paid for by other people's lives.  How is she?</content></utterance>
