<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Forget it. We're not here to fool around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Tony</speaker><content>I'm not fooling around. I need this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>You're an idiot. You know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Tony</speaker><content>Just shut up and give me a boost.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Hurry your ass up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Hey, sometimes a guy's got to do what a guy's got to do.  Jaguar one to control. Uh, sorry for the delay. Glenn had to take a leak. It was unavoidable.  Target area is clear. Repeat: Target area confirmed clear.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>Dr. Lee, target area is cleared. Launch vehicle's in range. All systems go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Thank you, Cesar. Whenever you're ready.  The CT-10's light enough to launch from a UAV, but can penetrate 8 feet of 6,000-psi concrete before detonation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content> Bomb's away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Precision guidance system's not affected by darkness or weather and can hit a 2-foot-wide target from 69,000 feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>General</speaker><content>What about sound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>None inbound at all. We've developed a new fan and a baffling design that—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>Ordnance on target in three, two, one.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Karma's a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think her seizures are the result of bad karma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think if you spend your days designing ever more effective ways to blow people up, stuff's bound to come back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thirsty. Side effect of a new antihistamine I'm on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You don't seem congested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm, intriguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You have any thoughts about our patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got some questions about whether Thirteen really believes in karma or just wants to. As for the patient, it's not gonna be easy to break into her office. Might want to start with her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am definitely interested. Could be a tumor. Could be a CNS bleed. What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> 50 bucks!  Pay up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Let's go. Let's go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bet's off. Fight was fixed.  That punch barely touched him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You bet on Foley to beat Zachary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Speed beats power… unless speed has been paid to speedily take a dive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He touched him enough to put him on the canvas and the official counted him out, which means you officially owe me… 50 bucks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We bet on a sporting event. That was not sporting. Less than 30 seconds. That was barely even event-y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, here's what I saw. You lost and I won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Prove it. Prove it or pay up. You got one day. And don't make me send my boys out looking for you.  What? All right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, two puzzles. Tie goes to the one that costs me money.  Keep each other posted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I've always been healthy. I never even get colds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I guess your luck finally ran out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I take it she doesn't like people who makes bombs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> It's all right. Half of my family feels the same way. Of course they all work on Wall Street, so… Ever since the first 4th of July I can remember, I've always loved explosions. When I got to college and I had to pick a major, figured I might as well pick something I'm passionate about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Destroying things. You weren't passionate about anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Bombs are tools, just like anything else. You can use it to make things better or you can use it to make things worse. I also like romantic poetry and picnics. Is there anything else you want to know before we do this MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nope. Try to stay as still as possible. This shouldn't take long.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, how's it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>You mind? I mean, there are plenty of other seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not here to judge. You did what was best for you and I got no problem with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>I'm not gonna ask you nice again. Just go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or what? You're suddenly gonna fall down? Listen. I got a problem. A guy who knows absolutely nothing about boxing, because of you now thinks he does. You can imagine the potential ramifications. I need you to get on the phone with him and tell him you took a dive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>I didn't take a dive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you and we're done. Just enough to convince him. Not enough to get you in any trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content> I didn't take a dive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That story's getting boring. Look, I'm not from the commission. I'm not some bookie. I'm a doctor. This is my I.D.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>Look, if you were a bookie, you'd know no one pays a guy to throw a fight he has no chance to win. I was a 12-to-1 underdog. Lost my last five fights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you were the better fighter. That last punch barely touched you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>You ever been barely touched by a guy who weighs 230 pounds? Look at me. Look where I am, what I'm wearing. Now, do I look like a guy who just got a payday? I didn't throw the fight. I just suck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ha!  Proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just because he wasn't hit in the face—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at his pupils. He has anisocoria, which, given his age, the adrenaline surge of the fight, the fact that he's still alive means he was tachycardic. He has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The bet was on who would win, not who would live the longest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he's physically unable to continue because of a preexisting illness, then it's technically a "no contest," which means all bets are off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know that just because I was right about this one fighter doesn't make you any less of a man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it would, if you were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then as I said earlier, prove it. And one possibly Photoshopped cell phone pic does not a diagnosis make.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>Oh, excuse me, Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Désolé, je ne parle pas anglais. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>I'm a co-worker of Wendy Lee's. I'm also her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. I'm a guy who doesn't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>She's your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you thought I didn't know who Wendy Lee was? Yeah, makes sense. I'm not good at names. Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>Her last boyfriend was a real nut. He's basically stalking her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, this is what I don't care about.  I don't care who cares about her. Used to care about her. Either one you falls down dead, you can drop me a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content> I think I know what's wrong with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You screwed up in the lab and accidentally spilled some bomb on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>No. He really is crazy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Poisoned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently our mad scientist is also a slutty scientist whose milkshakes got all the nerds in the yard fighting over her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's a slut because she's dated two different guys at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were still judging her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> She's not a slut and it's not poison. When we tested her blood and cerebral spinal fluid for toxic exposure, it was negative for every poison we could think of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, that just leaves every poison we didn't think of. She works in a bomb factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So do a lot of other not-sick people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The guy had any actual evidence she was poisoned, he would have gone to the police, not to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And if we had any evidence of what was wrong with her, you'd be showing us MRI results. I assume they were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Couldn't hurt to start activated charcoal, see what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what else wouldn't hurt? This case is getting interesting. Let's add a little danger.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just because he has guns doesn't make him a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Tell that to the bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Look in the desk. See if he's got a diary or a journal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Something tells me he's not exactly a diary kind of guy. Maybe a manifesto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just look. I'm gonna check out the rest of the place, see if he's got a computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's Foreman.  Yep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You break in yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, we're in the abattoir now. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can leave. I think Taub and I found what we're looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Looks like she actually was being poisoned, but she's been doing it to herself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I'm not an alcoholic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know. I know the whole label thing is so limiting. You're a person who happens to suffer from alcoholism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>You broke into my house and now you're being a smartass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>During your history, you said you didn't drink at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You just collect bottles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Yes. I collect them for my friend. She uses them in her art projects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you're ashamed of these art projects. The bottles were hidden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>That's because my housekeeper keeps throwing them out. I-I've told her a dozen times not to but either she doesn't understand or she doesn't care.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why would she lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's the easy question. She needs a government security clearance for her job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And what's the hard question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If she's an alcoholic, why doesn't she have at least some partially full bottles in the house? I mean, why keep the empties? Why not just throw them away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So she's probably telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We start her on Valium for alcohol withdrawal.  It's the best we've got right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One normal EKG does not a healthy person make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>Look, I told you I just suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you make me so sad. Don't talk like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content> Why do you care so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kill me for loving my patients. It's just what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, stop. Stop!  Look, my–my leg hurts. Okay? Just talk to me for a moment.  You don't have to be a loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever's wrong with you, it's real. Sick is good. Sick means it can get better. You cold get better. And I don't mean healthier. I mean… maybe you don't have to suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>Figure out what's wrong with yourself. Leave me alone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Hoffner</speaker><content>Abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>She said it felt like she was being stabbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Ah! Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give her morphine, 5 milligrams IV.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is it a symptom of the underlying condition or a symptom of our treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We'll know soon. I stopped her treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We should restart it. Acute pancreatitis from alcoholism would cause this kind of pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's stress related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's in a lot of pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's under a lot of stress. She's got two guys fighting over her and she got done with the final test of a new bomb. Her guilt is killing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As far as you know, she likes being the center of attention and loves her job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>As far as you know, she doesn't drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if it's a kidney infection? Acute pyelonephritis could kill her if we don't start her on IV antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Would kill her if it was pyelonephritis, but since her urine and CSF don't show signs of infection—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I paged House.  What? We got nothing. Less than nothing since he's actually ignoring my pages, which means we have a sick patient and apparently a sick boss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tell him you admit he's right. Let's get him back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If he's ignoring you, it's because he trusts you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, it's not, but he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thanks. I feel warm inside. Right now I'm debating which bad idea I should pretend is a good idea and force everybody to implement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think this is good for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Obsessing over a bet is good? And doing his actual job, treating actual patients, that's bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House only doing what House wants is the only way he can function. Since the breakup, he's been seeking out crazier and crazier things to do because they're crazy. This is — well, it's not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, just irresponsible and possibly dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>By House standards, it's dull. This he's doing just because he's interested. I think House getting back to doing… stupid House stuff for stupid House reasons is the best thing that could happen to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll go explain that to the patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>



<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's definitely not pancreatitis. Restarting the treatment obviously didn't help anything. I assume you tested for infections.  And I assume that look means "yes, and I was wrong."  You call for a psych consult? Wow. That's the same look I just got from Chase. So an hour ago, we had three theories we couldn't agree on. Now we've got no theories, but we're in agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>CT and ultrasound showed inflammation in the renal capsule. Could be an obstructing calculus or a perinephric abscess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blood cultures came back negative. It's probably just a benign cyst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, let's just dismiss an idea because it's probably nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be gas in the perinephric space, in which case, we should be prepping her for emergency surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What looks like Wolff-Parkinson-White but isn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her EKG was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So was his. That's why I said "looks like." As in similar to, but not the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You want us to help you get out of paying your bet while your actual patient lies in agony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's the real bad guy here? The guy who doesn't care enough to help or the four guys who are not competent enough to help? He works out too much, gets pounded too much, and not in the romantic way. His pupils—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your patient? No. Plenty of time to save her life after we save my money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Underlying neurological condition exacerbated by an acute UTI brought on by her sexual escapades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Slut? Escapades? How do we treat? A scarlet "A"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry. Acute UTI brought on by her healthy enjoyment of her womanhood. We start her on IV ampicillin and an aminoglycoside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You ignore us all the time. You go on crazy joyrides all the time. But you answer pages, you sleep.  I know I'm gonna regret doing this, but I'll ask anyway. Is there anything I can do to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Although…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great news! You have an underlying neurological condition, which together with your heart—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>You said my heart was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I also said I would get you your career back. But it doesn't seem to matter since you've so clearly been handed the golden spit bucket.  Sympathetic overdrive. It's a medical term. So is "great news." Of course, if you prefer wallowing…  All you need is a chin. And a heart, apparently. Then you can go back to being the guy who won 20 of his first 20 instead of the guy who lost 5 of his last 5. Although, technically, I count the last one as a "no contest."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>And you save 50 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a doctor. I don't tell a fat guy to lay off bacon for less than 300.  This is about dignity for both of us. Give me your arm.  Give me your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>My boss has me break into places all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pain has been getting worse. I figured if I upped the Vicodin any more, I'd end up back in a rubber room, so this seemed like the smarter choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You drove all the way over here to break in and call me an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, I drove all the way over here to tell you we're implanting an automated cardio-defibrillator, which won't actually do anything to help the patient except maybe give us enough time to come up with a guess as to what's actually wrong with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, that makes more sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And I broke in here because Cuddy and Wilson both separately asked me to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even more logical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And that's not heroin, which means you knew I was coming over here, and Cuddy and Wilson are right. You're just playing a game. Throwing out a bone and watching us fight over it. {She starts to leave in a huff.]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There is another theory.  Compound CS-804. It's an experimental drug that's supposed to regrow muscle.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is that an accusation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sounded like a question. Just a straightforward inquiry that only someone with serious insecurities would take issue with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay, so in answering, I have to decide between the only two possibilities. "No" and "yes, we might have screwed something up, but are intentionally hiding it because we're incompetent and we're asses." Answer is "no." Glad we didn't shortchange that avenue. It's a blood disorder. A coagulopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not a diagnosis. That's like saying she has a runny nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>True, but not saying she has a runny nose risks getting snot all over us. We can treat it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cause could still be a toxin. She must have been exposed to who knows—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Past tense, which means she would have been better now that she's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Same goes for House. If this was about Cuddy, he would have checked out weeks ago. Something else is going on. Something new.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You always have some opinion on these things, especially when it comes to House, double especially when it comes to men and romance, but suddenly you're keeping your mouth shut.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Great" is a little vague.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Riggin</speaker><content>Even better than the previous study. 12% increase in strength, 22% in flexibility, and some improvement in at least 60% of the subjects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you done maximum tolerated dose studies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Riggin</speaker><content>Not yet. But that's part of the beauty. Since the compound is easily excreted in urine, as long as they keep hydrated, there's really no reason to expect any danger at virtually any dose. I mean, obviously you can't know for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But if it's worthy of the preface "obviously," then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots. Do I look like an idiot?  Sorry. Cranky. What I meant to say was: Why don't scientists have groupies? 'Cause I'd do you right now if society wasn't telling me that you're just an underpaid dork.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bad news is, because of your extended exposure to her and her workplace, we're gonna need to treat you as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>I feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Unfortunately that's the way it can be with radiation. No symptoms until it's too late to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're gonna need a bone marrow transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>A marrow transplant does leave you exposed to all sorts of illnesses, but there really is no choice here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>She doesn't have radiation poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's getting better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We need to start your treatment before it's too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>Cesar</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're either suicidal or you know we're wrong. And the only way you could know for sure what wasn't killing her is if you knew what was. And you do, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because you've been poisoning her and the reason she's getting better is because you haven't been near her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Our co-workers are on their way to your home right now to search for poisons. You mind saving them the trouble?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Training for my big fight. Just need you to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content>Drink five more bottles? Get punched a few more times? Look, just get out and give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's your specialty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Foley</speaker><content> Ooh, looks like you already lost your big fight.  Look, I may not be able to take a punch, but I can still throw one.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Where's Cesar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Um… in jail. He was trying to kill you. He found out about you and Glenn, which, he admitted, shouldn't have surprised him since he started seeing you while you were dating Tony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>He poisoned me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Repeatedly… with Spanish fly. The active ingredient cantharidin is a potent toxin and can cause a lot of the same damage as radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>He poisoned me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>He had a security clearance.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ahem!  What's this?  A palm. Hmm, useful for many things. Slapping, greasing, probably some other applications too. Right now it's ready for $50 and humiliation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He was actually sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He wasn't knocked out by the punch. He was knocked out by the clinch before the punch. Took a shot to the back of the neck. More specifically, to an abnormal growth of nerves caused by a glomus tumor. Kind of like a built-in taser. Sent a massive shock to his entire body, shut everything down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow. Fascinating. Completely explains exactly how he lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you are not gonna be like that, 'cause you got a lot more posters here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I'm not. Well done, House. You might have saved that guy. Given him his life back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, no. He needs surgery. He's never gonna fight again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What happened to your eye? You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Better than okay.</content></utterance>
