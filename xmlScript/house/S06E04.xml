<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not permanently. He is setting up interviews to replace Taub and Thirteen, but it might take a couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, what happened to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He quit, and I had to let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You actually fired your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes. You two are both competent, and I know I can work with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You really do know how to woo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It would be interesting. We could work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Did you see who the patient is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's one of the reasons it'll be interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dibala is one of the most repressive dictators in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You had no problem treating a guy on death row.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Who was still in prison after we patched him up. We fix Dibala, he gets on a plane and executes half his country. He's been repressing an ethnic rebellion in the south, the Sitibi people.  It's getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dibala is a guest of the US government. And he's been invited to speak at the UN. I’m not asking you to love him. I'm asking you to do your job.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Utterly incomprehensible. And, of course, I’m talking about you firing your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We weren't getting along with her working under me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This'll help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cameron and I work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But you weren't her boss. And you’ve stopped working together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why don't you just tell her you were wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>'Cause I wasn't. I know how this looks. I know it might break us up. But that's better than definitely breaking us up, which is what would have happened otherwise.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God, it's three years ago. Does that mean I’m still crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're just helping out because –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. I just ran into Thirteen while she was clearing out her locker. My condolences. Although it's not like she's the hottest woman in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> We haven't broken up. Are you back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sort of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Did you get your license back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not for a month or so. So you'll be in charge. I'm just gonna pitch in a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Dibala thinks it was an assassination attempt. Polonium, like the Russian guy in London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>FBI checked the service of process forms and his hotel room. No radioactivity trails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Acid reflux?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No history of asthma or heartburn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He has a bug bite on his hands. Malaria's endemic in his country. Let's start him on coartem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't want to step on any toes, but I guess I do have a higher duty to the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you have something to say, say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room because you're rightly upset with me. Although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Do you have anything medical to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Poison fits better because of the vomiting. Bug bite might not be a bite. It might be the start of chloracne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Assassination attempt through dioxin poisoning. It's hard to detect. Fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Start him on olestra.  You couldn't have just said dioxin up front?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was hoping you'd get there on your own.  So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>You are sure it is dioxin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's our best guess. The olestra here binds to the poison, flushes it out of your system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Where are you from, doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm Australian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Do I hear a bit of the British?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Most people don't notice it. Yeah, I-I kicked around there for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>You went to medical school there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Actually a year of seminary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>And you left. Hmm, hmm. There was a Catholic mission near my childhood village. I liked the priests. They were good people. But when my two younger sisters were dying from consumption, it wasn't more priests we wanted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I fired my girlfriend because he said he was gone for good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need this in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A week ago, it was the last thing you needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Houes</speaker><content>It's a process. I'm learning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And screwing me over as you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that's why I did it.  Sorry. If you want, I’ll explain it to Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's not ready. He doesn't have his license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then he can't practice. But we'd be idiots not to listen to him. You're in charge, he sits in on all the differentials. Until you get your license back, this is all unofficial. No procedures, no patient contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think I can probably deal with that last one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The only reason I let you go is because our relationship wouldn't work if I was in charge. But I won't be in charge soon, so... I came to offer you your old job back. I know. I look bad. But circumstances have changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't want the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because there's a much simpler explanation for you firing me. You wanted to break up with me, but you were too weak to do it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then why would I try to hire you back? Can we please get some dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Uh, you're a follow-up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ruwe</speaker><content>You must not treat him.  Dibala killed my wife. She was a trade unionist.  They took her from our home while I was at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who took her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ruwe</speaker><content>Dibala's Youth Labor League. He pretends it's to get young people off the street. But he takes teenage boys from the provinces and feeds them drugs and alcohol and teaches them how to torture. They dumped her body in my yard two weeks later. They raped her. They carved inyenzi, cockroach, onto her stomach because she's Sitibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm very sorry, but I can't discuss other patients. You should talk to a lawyer, talk to the UN...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ruwe</speaker><content>So they can sit and watch, like they did in Rwanda? There are 2 million Sitibi. He's planning to massacre them all. His radio stations are talking about a final war to exterminate the cockroaches. He can't recover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sorry. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How was your first day of school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't pee once in the sandbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How was it with Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did you think I was talking about? Hmmm. You didn't use garlic. You didn't use it last night either. We always use garlic on Chicken Florentine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It tastes fine this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You seem to be losing your sense of smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think you're losing your sense of mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can check right now if you pull my finger. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, it's the –  Are you inventing some big medical mystery here? Because if you're imagining things again...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You weren't wearing shoes last night either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, shoes, garlic – I am vampire, Sookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told you to get that echo fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My downstairs neighbor, after you moved in, started complaining about the extra noise and the cooking smells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't want you making things worse. He's on the condo board, and I’m trying to get the back garden renovated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The white coats taught me a whole bunch of fun coping and relating skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's not only a total jerk. He's a decorated war hero who lost an arm in Vietnam. I mean, there's no winning with this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Coping skill number one… Complete avoidance.  You happy?  Booty call? Give me 20 minutes to not shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Patient's having a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mask at 15 liters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just thought you'd like to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Streptokinase, heparin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lassa fever. You were mad that I withheld it last time, so I’m saying it right up front. He's already stabilized, so 40 CCs of ribavirin, and we're home in time for Ellen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I checked. There's no Lassa in Dibala's country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The rash is gone. It rules out your dioxin theory. He's running a slight fever, which we can add to the heart, plus the lung ulcers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ebola? Marburg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Too long an incubation period. And… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't people sometimes travel? To places that have, you know, a fever that originated in the Nigerian town of Lassa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's been to three other countries in the last two years: here, Zimbabwe, and Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. No Lassa there either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh.  Again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Trypanosomiasis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No sleep disturbances. But fits best with the symptoms.  And it's geographically the most –  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The Egypt visit was for the African Union Meeting, Where I’m guessing he was  meeting people from  Africa. Which includes Liberia, which sent some members of their Foreign Ministry, which has itself just been hit by an outbreak of jock itch. No, wait. Not jock itch. Lassa fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll start the ribavirin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did say it up front. It's great to have the old team back together again, huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Yesterday, it's poisoning. Today, Lassa fever. Maybe a specialist –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Joseph! Leave him alone. These people know what they are doing. Are you married, doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>You have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Judging by your tentative answer and the complicated expression on her face, I believe that is she, standing in the hallway. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I got a call from Douglas' department at Princeton General. They want me to interview with them. Which is weird, because when I called last week, they said they had nothing available. So I never sent in my resume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Douglas owes me a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Most people send chocolates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'd stand outside your apartment all night holding up a boom box, except you told me you hate '80s music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So... about dinner, I'm free tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>I was wondering what that noise was. It's the damn cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I’m Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>And I can't sleep with you banging around with that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>Is that hard for you to understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end, not a tap shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>Now you're getting cute with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, we started badly. I apologize for the noise, and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>And a thousand other things I don't give a crap about. Now you keep it down, or we're gonna have trouble.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You paged me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>This is Ama. She is from our country, but she lives here now. We'd like you to use her blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>She recovered from Lassa fever two years ago. Our health minister has advised us that plasma from one who has the antibodies is much more effective than ribavirin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content> This is a signed consent form. Will you take her blood, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Ama</speaker><content>I want to do this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Ama</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you from the Sitibi people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Ama</speaker><content>I am Sitibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Did they threaten you in some way? Your-your family members back home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Ama</speaker><content> Please let me give the blood. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's being coerced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If she is, I’d rather have a needle prick on my conscience than the death of her family members.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hey!  You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Who is that man?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You did a stupid, terrible thing. But given the circumstances with your wife… You could get a reduced sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Ruwe</speaker><content>She wasn't my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then who was she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Ruwe</speaker><content>They never told us her name.  What his men made us do to that woman… He is now going to do… to all the Sitibi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You could have gotten killed.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The bloody eye was from an enlarged lymph node blocking the retinal vein. We restored circulation, but it means we've got to add lymph involvement to the heart, lungs, and rising fever.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I feel like I’ve been inadvertently undermining your authority, so I’m just gonna observe. Not gonna say a word. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The heart could point to sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm thinking the x-rays indicate a lack of hilar adenopathy, which rules it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Staph aureus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.  Because…  He…  Smokes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's miming a thermometer. He says the fever's not high enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So some other infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's wrong. The fever could be misleading us into thinking infection.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can't be lymphoma. LDH is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's got good liver function. It's masking the elevated levels. Biopsy the lymph node. Check it out. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You talked!  All I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful, burbling fountain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You could be sipping Courvoisier next to a replica of the Playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't have anything on him. I don't want anything on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The closest he's been to Vietnam? Ordering the mee krob at that place on the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mee krob is from Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What did you do? Why do you think he's faking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I saw his mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You broke in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. He was holding it. Private medical insurance. Not from the VA. Plus, he's got to be early 50s. He's too young to be a vet. So I looked further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You did break in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Online. There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why would he fake being a veteran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just look how you're acting. People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Normally, we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Victims get pity, heroes get adulation. It's way better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor. Now forget the Vietnam stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I could prove this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything, the guy’s a totally ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Which is the point. It's easy to be nice to people you like. But being nice to people you hate, that's a skill. Do it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Thank you for saving my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The man that tried to kill you, he said that you were preparing a massacre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>The Sitibi are my countrymen. I am fighting a guerilla war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In a way that's being called genocide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>20 years ago, these same Sitibi rebels took over the south. They massacred tens of thousands, and they would happily do it again. I'm trying to impose order. I'm trying to prevent a genocide. Genocide. My own son, my youngest, he is a student here. He hasn't spoken to me in years because of what he read in your newspapers. But what he read is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about your Youth Labor League?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Ahhhhhh. There I was at fault. I hired men, who, in their zeal, stepped over the line, and there were abuses. But that will not happen again.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How's it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Normal-looking nucleus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How's it going with you? It worried me when you joked about letting that man shoot Dibala.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I wasn't joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can't want to kill anyone, especially not your own patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's only natural to feel he should –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, it's completely unnatural. Only psychopaths can kill other people without having some sort of breakdown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not when it's justified. Look at soldiers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Even when it's justified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Am I trying to kill our patient? Of course not. But if he died, am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world? The cells are neatly differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine. It smells like… victory. That big flag in your place prompted me to chat with your housekeeper. Turns out you're a citizen of the Great White North.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>You broke into my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Technically, no. Well, technically, yeah, but two steps. Hardly –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>You're going to jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine? Falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>You think I’m faking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Murphy</speaker><content>They sent troops to reinforce the '73 Peace Accords, Which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine. 36 years later, every second, I feel the pain in my hand like I’m still grabbing that boy's arm, even though my arm isn't there. So, no, I’m not faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. On a related note, go Maple Leafs.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Did you get the biopsy results? Is it lymphoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. So we have to move on. Infection, perhaps autoimmune…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Did you get the biopsy results?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, I just told you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They both really like diagnostics. And I think they both really like watching House torture me. Anyway, thank you for understanding about the job. I had two really crappy alternatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There was a third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You could have stepped aside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We both would have lost our jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You could have asked Cameron or Chase to take your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They wouldn't have wanted to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You just said they both really like diagnostics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want to go back in time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I want to make this work. I want to understand you. I mean, you know how you made me feel. If you could do it again...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Obviously not, right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Will he ever be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think… Neurons don't grow back, and he's already in his decline. Anything he tells you, any command he gives, how will you ever know it's not just the delusions of a sick, mad, dying old man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He just started spiking a fever.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don't have some clever way of telling me this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patient's dying. I'm done with clever. Look at his skin.  It's tight for a 75-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Based on his admission photo? Bit subjective. Fever points to infection. And now he's got nodules on his fingers. That's blastomycosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nodules? And you're calling tight skin subjective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m with Foreman. We would have seen fungus balls on the head CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fungal lesions can be missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We could settle this with a test. Anticentromere antibodies would point to scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Point to, not prove. And his fever's too high. We have to treat him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive. You're with me on the scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I guess. I just don't care enough about the patient to waste my time trying to convince anyone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We get it. You don't like the guy, you didn't want to work on this case. And yet you're still here. Why don't you take a stand? Either do something about it or shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Treat him for blasto if you want. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll get Cuddy. I can convince her to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This isn't a democracy. I don't care who you get. At least for right now, this is my department. We're treating him for blasto. Start him on Amphotericin B.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>You tell my colonel I'm a sick, dying old man who can't be trusted.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>You were trying to put a gun in his hand and point it at my head. The gun is now in your hand. That is a practical difference, not a moral one. If you want me dead, then pull the trigger. It is not so easy when you have to do it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Allison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I guess I didn't want you dead. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>She is too weak to act on her beliefs. That is not her fault. Most everyone is. Even my own advisors. My own colonel.  All they do is negotiate and debate and sign treaties. They are appeasers. And all the while, we are beset by assassins and traitors, the scum –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Cockroaches? What are you going to do about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>What is an enemy to you? Some younger physician who covets your office? In my world, there are dangers and bloodshed and death. And that makes you a man. And men make choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And your choice is to send bands of drunk, crazed children to massacre an entire people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>Dibala</speaker><content>Don't ask me questions you don't want to know the answer to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're kicking me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll explain it to your psychiatrist, but… yeah. You got to go somewhere else.  House, I know when things go wrong, usually you just double down and get more involved, but here you could go to jail. And I truly believe that you've changed enough to know this is the right thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need a blood sample. We got to do the anticentromere antibody test. It'll show House is right. It's scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why are you doing this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because I didn't want to kill him. And you're right. I have to take a side. So I’m going to do what I can to keep him alive.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blasto still fits best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know it's not conclusive, but when you put it with all the other evidence –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I've made my decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Have you told Thirteen you were wrong to fire her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What does that have to do with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I've worked with you long enough to know you're reasonable. You can usually admit when you're wrong. But there's some deep part of you, that when you find you're wrong about the most important decisions you've made, you get insecure and you just retrench. If you want to mess up your relationship, that's your right, but you mess this up, our patient dies.</content></utterance>

Short version: I’m really trying to do work on some stuff. This is a definite setback. Although, in fairness, you really did make it tough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Phantom pain in your missing arm? Five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet. That's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This would be a lot easier if you do what the crazy guy who tied you up says.  Put your hand in there. Put your hand in there.  Now look. Mirror magic. Your arm is back.  Now clench both your fists at the same time. Clench. Real hard.  If you believe in God, pray that this is gonna work. You might also want to ask him why he blew off your arm. Ready? Now let go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion. If you're anything like me – and, by the way, you are – you need to know which.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's under lock and key in the morgue. His government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy. They're taking his body out tomorrow.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think this is really important –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One of the patients in the morgue was a 70-year-old woman who had scleroderma. You and Cameron, if you took that woman's blood, you could have messed up the test results so we treated Dibala for the wrong disease.</content></utterance>

Look at the news. The moderates are taking over. There's hope for peace talks. You tell the world that I faked this test, Dibala becomes a martyr. The massacres begin.</content></utterance>
