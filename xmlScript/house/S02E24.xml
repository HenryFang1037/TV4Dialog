<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because we’re human beings. It’s what we do. Said he was at a luncheon meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You took his history?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guy looks like Harpo. You should see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You asked him what book he’s currently reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s hilarious to watch him try and talk. I asked him anything I could think of. Favorite color? “Bwuu.”</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is either a toxin, infection, or an allergic reaction. I assume you gave him Epi, so that rules out allergies. Put him on antibiotics in case it’s an infection, and if it’s a toxin we’ll keep him here overnight, let the swelling go down, send him home. I’m going to the movies.  enters.]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Which one of you is House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Skinny brunette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>No, that’s Dr. Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m skinny. How do you know her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>I was a patient of yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Stay! Stay away from him. Shocking, isn’t it? Who’d want to hurt you? </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re pathetic.  Judging by the growth, I’d say I’ve been unconscious for two days. You’ve been sitting there the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Judging by the oily buildup in your hair, I’d say you’re lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was scared. Pardon me for caring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did I lose any organs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach, nicked the bowel, and lodged in the posterior rib. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I always say, if you’re going to get shot, do it in a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The one in your neck –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t remember that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>-- went right through, severed your jugular. The shooter turns out to be a guy who –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don’t care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor? Shot you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume his reasoning was faulty. So what was it? Infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The surgery went fine. You’ve had no post-op –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not me. Patient. Harpo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You just got shot, House. You should rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got shot. Diagnostically boring. Big fat tongue, on the other hand, endlessly entertaining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We biopsied his tongue. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it was negative. And the blood tests were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I didn’t say we did blood tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue and you don’t have to biopsy a tongue unless you’ve already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don’t involve torturing the patient. Any other symptoms beside the increased intracranial pressure? Any guesses on how I figured that one out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer. Since we don’t have a definitive answer, we must not have done an LP, and the most common reason not to do an LP is increased intracranial pressure.  He was shot by Security trying to – House.  Will you – House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m talking to Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Lie down, you’ve got to be in pain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not today, today I’m on morphine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> You’re gonna rip your stitches out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check Harpo’s trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Forget about the patient!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, you’re curious. Trash. You don’t know what I’m talking about, but you know it’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You can’t just be walking around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then, stop me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’ve lost blood –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Physically, stop me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You could damage –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can’t, because that would involve touching me and then things would get so sexually charged –  I’m twice your size, get your hands off me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Everything that lives, eats; everything that eats, poops: that’s why every organ has a sanitation department, a lymph system. Whatever’s doing the damage is dumping its waste in there. That’s what you meant by trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sorry, I know it’s crazy, but there’s no other place. The ICU stands for intensive care, he needs intensive care, so do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He needs to be shot again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He is handcuffed to his bed, he is sedated, he is not gonna hurt you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If your security was any good I wouldn’t have been shot in the first place. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He is where he’s supposed to be. Where you’re supposed to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who did my surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Gillick. Why, you’re going to send him a fruit basket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s annoying enough dealing with your Vicodin habit. Quit upping your morphine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not. I’m reducing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you’re not in pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m feeling better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Gillick is very good. Your recovery time –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My stomach kills me, my neck is throbbing, my leg feels better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s unbelievable. Since getting shot is not an FDA-approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes. Terribly, tragically wrong. Enjoy the mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system. If it’s alleviating pain, who knows what else it’s doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Get back to the ICU before you rip out your stitches and I have to chain you to your bed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>If I’d’ve killed you it would have been over. I need you to live because I want to see you suffer. </content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House. The test was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are you sure you want to be doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m fine, I think. Cameron, you got my records?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They don’t like to release patients’ operative notes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And yet you’re holding them. And whispering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Killer needs his rest. Otherwise he’s grumpy all day.  Hey! Wake up! Watch me save a life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Almost for sure it’s some sort of infection. We’ve got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it’s not even slowing the thing down. Unless we find out what type of infection, we can’t treat, and we can’t figure out what type because we can’t do an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do an LP.  See what I did there? Couldn’t have done that if you killed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We would have done an LP two days ago if we could have but that much pressure… something’s bound to go –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We would have done an LP two days ago if the risks hadn’t so obviously outweighed the benefits. We just cut a hole in his throat. The equation has changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Couldn’t have put it better myself. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pressure is 120 mL H20 with small visible excursions related to respiration and pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, within normal. That’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, that’s weird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You wanna hear a story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have a rule. People who shoot me forfeit the right to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>My wife was sick. None of the doctors could figure out why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I know this story. She died, so you selected one of her doctors to kill because that would make everything right again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>No, she lived. You cured her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m truly sorry I did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>In the course of investigating her illness, you convinced me that everything was relevant. You needed the truth. I confessed to you that I had had an affair. But it turns out it had nothing to do with why she was sick. Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms. You told her that. You also told her about my affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You caught crap. She left you. Now I’ve gotta pay because you couldn’t keep your little Killer in you pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>She killed herself. </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What sort of hospital has glass walls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>It’s my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You thought I just liked watching people get needles poked in their back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t worry, it’s not insulting. At least, not to you. You’re satisfied with that answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You’re Dr. House, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not going to shoot me, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You treated a friend of mine. She told me you only talk to people if you have to, and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sevens marry sevens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours. Maybe there’s some wiggle room if there’s enough money or if somebody got pregnant. But you’ve got at least three points on your husband and your frock says he didn’t do it for the money and your breasts say you haven’t had any kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Numbers don’t lie. We’re having trouble finding out what infection your husband has. The most likely culprit is an STD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You want to know if I’ve had an affair with someone closer to my integer and I have to tell you the truth or my husband will die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is your friend single?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>No. But I’ve always been faithful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wow. I would have bet money something would go wrong. Let’s rotate him back.  He’s bleeding into his ocular orbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>LP wouldn’t do this. Lots of pressure behind, got to relieve it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What’s going on? What are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I should go.  I seem to have torn my stitches. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You collapsed in the hall. Tore your stitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I remember. I was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>How’s your gut? It’s hurting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>She locked herself in the garage and she started the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener?  You’re an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Now that is a bold position to take given that I shot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The shooting just makes you an idiot. You’re an ass because you’re trying to wrap it in a flag like you did a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You’re an ass and a hypocrite. You don’t believe in rules, you do whatever you think is right… it’s all I did. You were my role model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Watch out, you’re getting crumbs on the flag. I didn’t commit to honor her, I didn’t commit to never lie to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Well, if you kept your mouth shut, she’d be alive and you wouldn’t be shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you kept your pistols in your pants –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>It’s my fault she’s dead! I know it. But why can’t you admit it’s maybe just a little bit yours, too? That maybe it’s not just medical mistakes that screw things up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here’s how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Infections don’t make your eyes pop out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We should get back. You’re supposed to be chained to your bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not done eating. Got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This is really stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, my stitches pop out again, I got three doctors to save me. Could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins.  Okay, I’ll be you guys.  “No way, mate! Too much blood to just be a vein! No way hizzy! If it was an artery, he’d still be bleeding!”  “Actually, he’d be dead.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He could have had a granuloma in his sinuses that bled, that could have been caused by Wegener’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while sticking the eyeball back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tongue and eyes are sick. What about the nose? It’s right in between, why isn’t it sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So it’s not spreading, it’s got a common source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which can only be what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The brain, except the CT was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check the brain’s trash, see what it's hiding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The brain doesn’t have a lymph system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know, all its garbage just gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re referring to the blood-brain barrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What else? Biopsy the barrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wouldn’t it be safer to make a few educated guesses first? Try some relatively safe treatments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Biopsy the barrier, first start him on mebendazole in case it’s a worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And Levofloxacin in case it’s an infection slipped by the first antibiotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And azithromycin for STDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I really don’t think the wife is the kind to be messing around. If I was married to her I certainly wouldn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House. The patient isn’t married, he’s a widower.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Really, it’s more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My body is fine.  My mind, on the other hand –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe she was a girlfriend. Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spoke to every nurse on that floor, the patient only had six visitors. Two females, no babes. His mother and his aunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So they missed someone. They’re not Security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They were a little busy trying to save the guy’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s only one possible conclusion. It was a hallucination. What does that look like to you, a .6? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Anesthesia? No, it’s gotta be 6 smudge. Let’s say you’re right. It wouldn’t be that uncommon after trauma, after that much blood loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My perceptions are compromised and my judgment is compromised. What if his wife told me that the patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leopard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So pull yourself off the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the next case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You take two weeks. You recover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And what if I don’t? What if it wasn’t the shooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The guy who sees connections between everything sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruption?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if it was the surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who showed you your surgical file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you know it’s mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because your patient hasn’t had surgery and you don’t care about anyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My anesthesia was almost non-existent, and yet I wasn’t awake. For some reason, someone decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It worked!  There’s a clinic in Germany, they’ve been treating chronic pain by inducing comas and letting the mind basically reboot itself. There’s about a fifty percent chance your pain will come back, which, of course, means there’s a fifty percent chance that it won’t.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could mess with his brain, it wouldn’t cause fever.  He’s been sleeping a lot lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You worried? I marked a change of meds on his chart.  Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fever.</content></utterance>

Except it’s still light outside, your neighbor will see you. So you go out the back way, into an alley and drop off your trash by their garage.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got that from trash cans in the alley?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>How did he know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Right. ‘Cause you’ve got nothing but respect for him. Maybe he knew the answer because the question wasn’t nearly as tricky as you thought. Maybe he’s not getting smarter. You’re getting dumber.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You pretend to buck the system, pretend to be a rebel, claim to hate rules.  But all you do is substitute your own rules for society’s. That’s a nice, simple rule – tell the blunt, honest truth in the starkest, darkest way. And what will be, will be. What will be, should be. And everyone else is a coward. But you’re wrong. Someone cowardly should not call someone an idiot. People aren’t tactful or polite just because it’s nice. They do it because they’ve got an ounce of humility. Because they know that they will make mistakes, and they know that their actions have consequences, and they know that those consequences are their fault.

Keep riding, I’ve got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 clicks by Friday. What about blood from the kidneys? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kidneys drain into the bladder which drains into the ureter, there’s no way it would mess with the scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, basic human anatomy. Therefore, I think it’s safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere. But given that this case doesn’t make any kind of sense whatsoever maybe we should even question the basics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe he’s not human.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let’s not rule that one out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Even more likely, he is human, his anatomy is where it’s supposed to be, but he has testicular cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I screwed up some basic anatomy and I’m misconnecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem. Think there’s any way I would have done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can’t think. Seeing as how I’m too old to become a professional athlete, she screwed me over, big time. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you’ve got a good life, you’re healthy, you’ve got no reason to bitch, no reason to hate life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, here’s the flaw in your argument: if I enjoy hating life, I don’t hate life, I enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn’t say it was rational.  HIV testing is ninety-nine percent accurate, which means there are some people who test positive, who live with their own impending doom for months or years before finding out everything’s okay. Weirdly, most of them don’t react with happiness, or even anger. They get depressed, not because they wanted to die, but because they’ve defined themselves by their disease. Suddenly, what made them ‘them’ isn’t real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t define myself by my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you have taken it one step further. The only way you could come to terms with your disability was to some way make it mean nothing. So you had to redefine everything. You have dismissed anything physical, anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you protecting her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because she’s done nothing wrong?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, I am. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You agonize over moral choices. You aren’t completely comfortable with anything until you’ve taken days to get your head around every possible side. I’ve known what she did for six hours. How come you’re acting like you’ve known for days?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re unbelievable. Even when you’re out of your mind with anger and fear, you still couch it in logical terms. Are you hallucinating?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I never called Wilson by his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, right. The hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not the hallucinatee, Wilson was the hallucinatee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You think maybe you’re focusing on the wrong thing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy’s office was the hallucinatee, the bathroom was the hallucinatee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Ah. Bathroom. It figures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What figures?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, let’s recap. We’ve just ruled out everything, which doesn’t make sense, and the answer has to be something that does make sense. Do a cystoscopy, make sure he’s human.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everything was right where it was supposed to be, all the tubes go where they’re supposed to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. Find out if his father hunched?  His father have trouble peeing?  His father have sex with his own mother? The answer to any of these questions, if yes, assume you’re right. If the answer’s no, assume you’re right, but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to make sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But then we’d have to cut through his stomach, and since he’s clearly got a bleeding problem, this kind of surgery might –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t clearly have anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How did I get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don’t remember how I got here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m taking myself off my case.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think I’m losing my mind. I’m having blackouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You said you weren’t having any –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you are doing this to scare me, you made your point. Next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m off the case.  Why did you jump up when I came in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I thought you were going to attack me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah, you were in my face. You were –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You came in here with Wilson and –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>-- which means this is a hallucination.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How can I tell what’s real and what’s not? Everything looks the same, sounds the same, tastes the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Seems like I’d be the last person you’d want to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not? You’re obviously not here. I’m obviously not here, which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I’m really just asking my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You’re talking to yourself, there’s a lot of unnecessary explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, I’m trying to work this out. That requires give and take, even in my own mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>All right, what was the question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How can I tell what’s real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound like something I’d ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>All right, your concern is that if you act in the real world based on information that’s not real, the results are impossible to foresee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With you so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>But information is incapable of harm in and of itself. Ideas are neither good nor bad, but merely as useful as what we do with it. Only actions can cause harm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That sounds like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>So you do nothing, you refrain from taking any actions. Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would, but if they’re based on faulty assumptions your team will point that out. They won’t do anything that could hurt him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I trust my team.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It means you’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means one of your assumptions is wrong, because if something doesn’t make sense it can’t be real. So what are our assumptions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We don’t have any, we’re just guessing and testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We assume the tests are right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s more basic than the test results?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can fill another cup of water, but we’ve gotta dive in. We’ve gotta see what’s actually in there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We assume he’s got a bleeding problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn’t supposed to bleed, causing parts of his body to blow up! Assuming that crazy assumption is correct, we operate on him, we’ll kill him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>If I’d’ve killed you, would it have mattered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You don’t care whether you live or die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I care because I live. I can’t care if I’m dead. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>I don’t want to hear semantics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You anti-semantic bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Would anybody care that the world lost that wit? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Working, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>That’s all right, you don’t have to say anything. Just let me soak into your subconscious. You think that the only truth that matters is the truth that can be measured. Good intentions don’t count, what’s in your heart doesn’t count, caring doesn’t count, that a man’s life can’t be measured by how many tears are shed when he dies. It’s because you can’t measure them. It’s because you don’t want to measure them. Doesn’t mean it’s not real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That does not make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>And even if I’m wrong, you’re still miserable. Did you really think that your life’s purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return? No.  You believe there is no purpose to anything. Even the lives you save you dismiss. You turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it, strip it of all meaning. You’re miserable for nothing. I don’t know why you’d want to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I know what’s wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Great. What’s he got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case? I’m having hallucinations, blackouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But you’re always insane, and you’re always right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m almost always eventually right. You have no way of knowing when ‘eventually’ is. Every time I’ve had an epiphany on this one you guys were right on board. No challenges, nothing to explain. No offense, but either you guys are getting smarter or I’m getting dumber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ve worked with you long enough to know –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know the test results even before you enter the room. We have identical knowledge. How is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something doesn’t make sense. One of your assumptions has to be wrong, because if something doesn’t make sense then it can’t be real. But what if the faulty assumption is that it’s real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, you’re losing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve lost it.  Why did you stop me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because I think you’re going to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t think that. You know it, because you’re in my head. As long as the delusion makes sense my mind lets it go on. To make it not make sense I have to push it past the point where it can trick my mind. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, hey! This is a nightmare, you’re gonna wake up. It’s real, you’re killing a man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s also possible I may already be dead, but I don’t believe in the afterlife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House, go back to your room. If this is a hallucination, it’s a good one: you’re pain free, you can walk –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is not real, therefore it’s meaningless. I want meaning.  Oh, God.  Goodbye.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be okay.</content></utterance>
