<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>We’ll call you when we’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I’m sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So she’s really coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content>Who’s coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You give her a raise? Increase her benefits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t have TiVo on this thing, can’t rewind. Shut up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content>He’s examining me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s got to go back to work as soon as I’m done with the examination. Guess I do, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It’s got to be something. I mean, she didn’t come back because she likes you.  Wait a minute! She did come back because she likes you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content>Heh heh! You dog! You slept with her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep talking. I’ll finish your exam with a prostate check.  I’ve agreed to take her on one date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?!? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content>So, you in to this girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No! She’s not giving me any choice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content>Wait… she’s making you do her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Date her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Young ingénue doctor falling in love with gruff, older mentor; her sweet gentle nature bringing him to a closer, fuller understanding of his wounded heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Some guy</speaker><content> Do her, or you’re gay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For God’s sake. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Wilson and Some guy</speaker><content> Sitting in a tree, K-i-s-s-i-n-g.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Grow up. And learn to harmonize.  Damn it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who the hell walks around with an open urine sample?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I didn’t, uh, I didn’t… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You think that was a bit of an overreaction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, he peed on me. I’m not into that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s apple juice. Now go find that man and apologize. One more patient complaint and you’re looking at a suspension. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I forgive you for ruining my jacket.  Look, you seem like a regular kind of guy, not the type to get another regular guy into trouble, am I right?  Twenty bucks cash if you’ll stop crying.  Forgive me, yell at me, just give me something I can work with, okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Game’s over. You two make nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a wheelchair, and get this guy into the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right pupil’s blown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Holy… you gave the guy a stroke? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> So the bear wipes himself with the rabbit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lame. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What are you doing here? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What, here in this office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House practically begged me to come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Please tell me you took him to the cleaners?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Same lousy salary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then why’d you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Cause this is the happiest place on Earth. 21-year-old male, comes in with grinding of the teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And House gives him a stroke, totally blows out his pupil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You scared a guy into stroking out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does that surprise anyone here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Blown pupils usually means brain stem edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, but since he’s not dead or in a coma, I’m going with stroke to the optic nerve.  CT scan shows two things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ischemia. Death of brain tissue. Means there’s been some damage, hopefully not permanent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s it. There’s nothing there to tell us what the underlying cause is. We’ve got to do an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re looking at the wrong part of the scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m looking at the brain, what else is there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The jaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The jaw tells us why he stroked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, the jaw tells us why we can’t do an MRI. Unless we want his jawbone flying across the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Metal plate. He’s had major reconstruction and there’s no way we’re removing it, so we’re forced to be clever. Angiogram to rule out vascultis, EMG for peripheral neuropathy, tox screen to eliminate drugs, an echo to rule out cardiac emboli.  Dr. Cameron. I’d appreciate you keeping the terms of your new contract to yourself. Don’t want everyone clamoring for the same perks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> What perks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nothing you’d be interested in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So it’s not money, then? Office space, insurance, parking… anything he could offer you, we’d be interested in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He agreed to go on a date with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> A date? Date, dinner and a movie, naked and sweaty date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He only committed to the first two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s so, he’s so old!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And you’re so young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s a big mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s my boss. I’m allowed to sexually harass my boss. I’ll arrange for the EMG,  you want to set up the angiogram, and  you get the blood samples, patient history, patient consent? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Like watching an accident about to happen.]</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Morning! Harvey, I’m Dr. Foreman. I’m here to discuss your case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>I’m Annette, I’m Harvey’s friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nice to meet you. I need your next of kin, you didn’t fill that out on your intake form. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Harvey’s parents are dead. They died two years ago in a car crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I see. So, Harvey, you have any siblings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>No, and no grandparents or uncles or aunts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Annette, I don’t want to have to ask you to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I want her to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, she can stay.  You do the talking. Why’d you come to the clinic this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Uh, about six months ago, I started grinding my, my… you know, in your mouth, you get, you chew with them…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Teeth. Harvey’s experiencing a little nominal aphasia, you know, when you can’t remember nouns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I know what nominal aphasia is. Have you had any treatment for the teeth grinding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I went to a, you know, they do that thing with sharp, uh, pointy things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Needles? Someone took your blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>No, they make you breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pulmonologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>No, she had this, uh, electrical machine… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>He saw an acupuncturist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uh huh.  Do you know what the acupuncturist did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>She diagnosed Liver Qi stagnation and sent Harvey to a Shen balancer. He referred him to a homeopathic doctor who sent him to chiropractor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Naturally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Well, the chiropractor thought it might be food sensitivity and sent Harvey to a naturopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>The naturopath sent me back to the…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Back to the acupuncturist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. Well, we’ll need to see the records from all of those, uh, practitioners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everything set for the angiogram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cameron’s got the EMG first. Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Harvey’s guru.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’s what she called herself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s what she acted like. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Hi. I’m having vaginal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pleasure to meet you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>My OB/GYN died recently. He’s a nice man. Warm hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not anymore. So, does it hurt when you tinkle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s when it’s worse. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have some vaginal tearing. No sign of brusing, no indication of trauma, forced entry… Ramona. You naughty girl. You’ve either got yourself an 18-year-old boyfriend or an 80-year-old with some little blue pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Myron thought he’d just try them out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lucky you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Prefer it if Myron was a little droopier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Maybe a little. We used to hold hands, read together, or watch Jeopardy! I haven’t seen Jeopardy! in almost a month!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Have you talked to him about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You try talking a 73-year-old out of sex. With all these male enhancements the pressure to put out’s incredible. It’s worse than high school. He doesn’t get what he wants from me, he’ll get it from Connie in the corner condo. She’s dying her hair red! Major league slut. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here’s a prescription for vaginal estrogen suppositories. It’ll help with the lubrication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Thank you. Maybe you could give Myron a prescription. Something weaker than he’s got now? Tell him it’s better for his heart – he’d buy that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can’t tell him the truth, so you want me to lie to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Close your legs. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nerves stimulate muscles to move by creating a small electrical current. The machine will measure that. And I will insert this needle into various muscles and ask you to flex. Sometimes it can be painful. Let me know, and I can pull back –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>No. I mean, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Okay. Put your arm out to the side.  You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>I’m good. You don’t have to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Raise your arm up over your head. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The EMG was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, based on this history it’s either toxic herbs from the homeopath, spinal damage from the chiropractor, infection from the needle that the acupuncturist accidentally let sit in eye of newt, or the Shen balancer. What the hell is a “shen” and how come it’s lopsided?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report. Mitral valve prolapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine, you’d make a damn fine living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Clot’s formed on a faulty valve, gets sent to the brain, voila! Stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course, no harm, no foul. It’s just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could also be an aneurysm due to trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Trauma? From what, the chiropractic treatments? It’s bacterial endocarditis, an infected valve. We should do blood cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world. But that’s just me being all narrow again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I noticed a small bruit when I listened to Harvey’s left carotid. You could hear that if you had an aneurysm from trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Aneurysm would have shown on the angiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, not necessarily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. Quite a dilemma.  Oh, great pool hall oracle, grant me guidance.  Do we go with Foreman’s theory, which is at least marginally supported by medical test results, or Chase’s theory, which is completely unsupported by medical evidence. What to do…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The guy obviously broke his jaw somehow. Who knows what other trauma he’s suffered? We should do the angiogram again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And all signs point to…  Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken. Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wow. Yeah, I get it. House is adorable. I just want to hold him and never let go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re choking him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Foreman, stop. Let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> She was trying to kill him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>No. No, she wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His vitals seem okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Please. Please don’t hurt her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What the hell is going on in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s… she’s a dominatrix.  Right, Annette?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>The patient asked you to strangle him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac. He likes to be strangled or smothered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>That’s just sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that’s an intriguing legal opinion. Geez, what kind of a lawyer is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>You want a legal opinion? Call the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>I was careful. I watched the monitors, made sure his O2 stats were over 90. I would never hurt him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then what was the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Harvey was upset. He needed to calm down. To feel in control by being controlled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Eh.. um… He pays you for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content> In return, he does my taxes and cleans my house. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’re not done here, we have to talk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Call the cops, bar her from the hospital, force her to pierce your nipples… not really medical decisions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was a long time ago. I was seeing this woman. A banker, and turns out she liked to be burned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You actually dated someone who likes to get burned? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, why would you want to be in a relationship with someone that’s so obviously only going to lead to pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was a weird scene. I observed – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase. Did you know about this woman? What she does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I met her at some parties, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wouldn’t have tortured you if I knew you liked it.  Well, here’s a phrase to remember: “Hey, this guy might have been pounded on the head one too many times!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I said I thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you’d mentioned the “liking pain” thing. You’re on my naughty list. Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m not into –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume you never started him on antibiotics or blood thinners before Mistress Ilsa’s rude interruption.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was probably a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You still think Chase is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, he’s probably right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then we should schedule him for vascular surgery. Go into the carotids, find the aneurysm, repair it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If we put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But if Foreman’s right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think Chase is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we’ll probably kill the guy. So, start him on blood thinners, and if he has another stroke, then we’ll schedule the surgery.  Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>You Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have a feeling I’m going to regret this, but yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Ramona said I should come to you for my refill.  Uh, with, for the beginning to droop?  She said you’d probably want to talk to me first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She lied.  Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Always happy to make people happy. Goodbye.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content> Sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t want more sex?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>The truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sounds crazy when you put it like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Oh, Ramona’s got a big appetite. If I don’t perform, I don’t want to lose her.  You got a pharmacy around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the hospital? Could be. Let’s see if we can find it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Pharmacist</speaker><content> You looking for ED medication?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that’s one example of a blue pill. Name six others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Pharmacist</speaker><content>There’s a brand of acetaminophen out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfect. Fill her up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Little busy here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I heard about Dr. Cameron’s conditions for coming back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s purely business. I’ll make sure you get the recipt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I think it’s a good thing. What happened in your last relationship, it’s no reason to wall yourself from people forever. 5 years of self-pity is probably enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Well, you’ve certainly given me a lot to think about. If only I was as open as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Bear in mind Cameron’s probably the only female that can tolerate you. Wear the sky-blue shirt. It almost makes you look nice.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content> I was scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I need you to squeeze with both hands.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Weakness in his right arm and hand. Harvey’s having mini-strokes; the blood thinners aren’t making a difference.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I said Chase was probably right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh yeah, we’ve all got perfect 20-20 hindsight. Get a hold of Main in vascular, see if his surgical dance card is free for tomorrow. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You couldn’t keep your mouth shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I didn’t see any reason to. Where are we going? I want to make sure I dress appropriately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be army boots and t-shirt. It’s the county paintball tourney. First prize is fifty bucks; I’ll split it with you if you hold your end up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m not sure if that was the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. I made a reservation at Café Spiletto. Regarding wardrobe: are you too young to remember spandex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ll figure something out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The surgery will repair the damaged blood vessels in your neck and your strokes will stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>All this is because of the strangulation?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content> I can’t, I can’t. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I already did. Mashed them up in his applesauce, it’ll lighten him up soon enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone should just tell him to do it. Way faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Except that’s forgery. Also illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And I already tried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not you. Where’s a good dominatrix when you need one?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>Not because you deserve it. You’ve been bad. You will have the surgery, do you understand?  Do not laugh at me. You will respect –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Where do you get off telling me what to do? Get out of my way, you back-faced witch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Is that part of their deal, or…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>This isn’t like him.  Something’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Get out!  Get out!  Get out, get out! [Harvey knocks over the tray with dishes on it before Chase and Foreman get his arms.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s making me question my view of myself as a people person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>Now you want to do surgery on him without his consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The kid’s in a coma, he needs the surgery!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>He said no. We can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Emergent situation, invoke heroic measures.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>I’ll need to show the judge an affidavit from next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, they might have a problem signing anything seeing as how they’re dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>He’ll want proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like what, dad’s hand? I don’t even know where they’re buried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>Bring me a published obit or a death certificate and we’ll run with it. I don’t want you to mess up your clothes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great, and when your searches turn up nothing you should try to find out where they live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He said they were dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Accountants, they’re usually pretty good with money, so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe they were bad accountants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim? The odds are astronomical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe Harvey burned through their money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’d be my bet. Go to his apartments. See if you can find his folks. Address, number, something. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, can I talk to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look, Cameron’s a friend. This whole dating thing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Time’s up. Thanks for playing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, I’ve been on the scene more than you recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way ahead of you. I’ve got a case of malt liquor stashed in the trunk, Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD, we are gonna get all the way down. Now move. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Come on, you’re not into her. Most guys who aren’t interested in a woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you know me too well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s what I’m saying. I think you should go with your instincts here. Be a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m missing my soap for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Women love to be right. You’ve got to leave them feeling superior. Like they’ve dodged a bullet. If you’re nice, she’ll blame herself –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And fall for me even more. The Love Doctor has made an art of breaking up with women. ‘Cause you’re convinced that the loss of you would be too devastating for any woman to handle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yeah, I’m the one with the serious ego problem here. I’m just saying: some relationships aren’t meant to happen. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sorry to have bothered you. Thank you. Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, Harvey Park.  Great, we’ve been looking for you! I’m calling from the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. Harvey’s here, and it’s rather… He hung up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You tell him why you were calling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I didn’t get a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Call back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll do it.  Let the master show you how it’s done.  Mr. Park? This is Dr. House calling from Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Your son Harvey is dead. We need you to identify the body. Yes, I’m sorry, it’s the law.  There’s a real art to delivering bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They’re gonna show up at the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Be sure to let me know when Cuddy starts screaming. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You lied to them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s only a white lie. Technically, all I did was call them a little early. Trust me, he’ll be dead real soon. Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Just as soon as you sign this surgery consent. I have a pen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Harvey’s your son. I’m sure you still care about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you don’t get off on embarrassment the way your son does. I guess it skips a generation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Lawyer</speaker><content>How much money would it take to compensate you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute. But here’s the thing. Humiliation comes in all kinds of packages. People finding out that your son’s a perv, that’s pretty high up there. People finding out that you’d rather let your son die than sign a piece of paper, where’s that rank? And trust me, if I have to paste up a sign in every nail salon and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania, I’ll make sure they know.  Your son will be in surgery first thing in the morning. Dumplings, that was a cheap shot. </content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hi. Are you, uh, can we talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Gee, I wonder what this is going to be about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just want to make sure no one gets hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I will be fine. Everybody’s acting like I’m going out with Jack the Ripper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not you I’m worried about.  It’s been a long time since he opened up to someone, and I… you better be absolutely sure you want this because if he opens up again and gets hurt, I don’t think there’s going to be a next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re worried I’m going to break his heart?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The wide side’s too short. You’re gonna look like Lou Costello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is a mistake. I don’t know how to have casual conversation. You think you’re talking about one thing, and either you are and it’s incredibly boring, or you’re not because it’s subtext and you need a decoder ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Open doors for her, help her with her chair –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have been on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh, not since disco died. Comment on her shoes, her earrings, and then move on to D.H.A. Her dreams, hopes and aspirations. Trust me. Panty-peeler. Oh, and if you need condoms, I’ve got some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did your wife give them to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Drug rep. They’ve got antibiotics built in, somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I should cancel. I’ve got a patient in surgery tomorrow. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And if you were a surgeon, that would actually matter. That’s a good idea, settle your nerves. Get me a beer, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re gonna eat before dinner? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is pretty lame, right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think she likes lame.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> It’s beautiful. And you look very handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ve always loved this restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s changed a lot since the last time I was here. It used to be a strip joint.  Nice earrings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>My mom’s. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice shoes. Comfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m not expecting you to be someone you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re in a restaurant, we’re dressed up, we’re eating. If not small talk, what is there? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> According to Freud, and I’m paraphrasing, instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can’t control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it. Like an eighth-grade boy punching a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I treat you like garbage, so I must really like you. Given your Freudian theory, what does it mean if I start being nice to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That you’re getting in touch with your feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. So there’s absolutely nothing I can do to make you think that I don’t like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sorry, no. I have one evening with you, one chance, and I don’t want to waste it talking about what wines you like or what movies you hate. I want to know how you feel about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You live under the delusion that you can fix everything that isn’t perfect. That’s why you married a man who was dying of cancer. You don’t love, you need. And now that your husband is dead, you’re looking for your new charity case. That’s why you’re going out with me. I’m twice your age, I’m not great looking, I’m not charming, I’m not even nice. What I am is what you need. I’m damaged. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Came in late. Had a good time last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How’s the surgery going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Harvey’s doing fine so far. How’d the night go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was fine, how was your evening?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She had the ravioli, I had the puttanesca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, I really want to know about the quality of the food. Either something very good happened, or something very bad. Which is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards. Maybe it was the garlic bread.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or the wine. Something made my eyes puffy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. Crying in your pillow can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was the wine. We had a nice, candid conversation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing deep, mostly small talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Took your advice, complimented her shoes, that’s fifteen minutes of chat right there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No snide comments?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which means we’ve got no idea what’s causing the strokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s had two more post-op. We won’t know the extent of the damage until he comes out of the coma. If he comes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe we should go back to the blood thinners, up the dosage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it’s not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears. Then he won’t be able to hear.  Oy ve.  Nobody home, leave a message!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>This is important!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo. Better get a full-body scan. If it is clots, it’d be good to know where they are.  Sorry about that. Guy dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Those pills you gave Myron, they’re not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, glad to see you’ve got the correct perspective on the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Well, the old ones, you know, made me feel like a tree!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice visual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>The new ones, well, might as well be eating candy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Candy wouldn’t take away your headaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You came to me and told me that you were having too much sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I never did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You too, Sequoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Well no, that’s not true, I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know that everybody lies, but you’d think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn’t be trying so hard.  Your rings don’t match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>What, well, why would they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, style is one thing, but one silver, one gold? How long have you guys been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>49 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content> 55 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn it, you’re having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Did you really say you wanted to have less sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Well, less. If I wanted none I’d stay home with Esther.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I just need a little rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You guys aren’t the victim of the little blue pill, you’re the problem!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Me, too. I should just have told you how I felt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aw.  Oh, welcome to hell. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-31"><speaker>Myron</speaker><content>Hey, how ‘bout the pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Chase, these breath mints you’ve been popping since yesterday. Are they a new fetish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, I got them at Harvey’s. What, I just took two boxes; the guy’s got a whole drawer of them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you didn’t find that interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, there’s lots of interesting stuff at his place. The mints weren’t high up on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase, get your nose in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you’re trying to humiliate me, I told you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, just put your face in his mouth. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rich, wouldn’t you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Uh. Smells like old vomit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Number one sign of fulminating osteomylitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Infection of the jaw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably from the original break. Never healed properly.  Infected tissue from the jaw breaks off, blocks blood flow to the brain, and life just isn’t worth living without blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was hidden from the scans by the metal plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And an infection of the jaw isn’t likely to show up on blood tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So how do we confirm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like this.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus.  We’re gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw? Okay, call a surgeon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Dr. House.  How’s tricks, Annette? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>I just wanted to see if he was okay. I’ll leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. I came to talk to you both. Like I tell all my patients, you’ve simply got to say “no” to strangulation. Me, I’m a freak, I get off on not being in pain. That, and chocolate-covered marshmallow bunnies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>He’s not a freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, he is. A little. But it’s got to stop. Or he’ll die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Annette</speaker><content>It’s not about pain. It’s about being open, being completely vulnerable to another person. If you can learn to be that deeply trusting… it changes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, lock him in a cage. That should be fine, medically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Harvey</speaker><content>Dr. House. Were my parents here? Did they come to see me? </content></utterance>
