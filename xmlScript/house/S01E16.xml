<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>I don’t want to go to school, I can do my work at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Jessica, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Everybody hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Oh, they don’t hate you. They don’t even know you because they’re too ignorant to try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>I hate myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Jessica, don’t say that. Oh, honey, look at me, look at me. You are a wonderful, beautiful, little girl. Don’t let a few bad apples –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>A few?  Try my whole class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Remember the story where the guy keeps saying that he hates green eggs and ham, and then at the end he realized he really loved them? One day they’re gonna realize what a great kid you really are. You’ve just gotta be like Sam I Am, and don’t give up.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ever see an infected pierced scrotum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I’d like to see it happen. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if pain’s what you’re after the penis is really the way to go. I’d recommend the apadravya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’re not talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh? Sounded like we were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you’re attempting to avoid talking because you know what I want to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nipples?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You need to get rid of one of your people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. As soon as I do performance reviews. And then review the reviews, of course. Because a decision like this can’t be made without proper, you know, review. Shouldn’t take longer than a month, maybe two. Four at the most, unless it gets complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There’s no way out on this. You may as well get it over with as fast as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it’s a human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Like you care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like you don’t. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have a week. Get it done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We have a referral from Dr. Linkowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He knows you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Definitely don’t know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The patient’s ten.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ten year olds do not have heart attacks. It’s gotta be a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. The simplest explanation is she’s a forty-year-old lying about her age. Maybe an actress trying to hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I meant, maybe the tests were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s what the ER thought. Three CKMBs were positive, the EKG shows classic signs of ST elevation. It’s a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s morbidly obese. The “morbid” part of that raises alarms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Come on, it takes decades to eat your way into a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Doesn’t take decades to kill yourself. If I was that fat, I’d be pretty tempted to knock back a bottle of pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not a drug overdose. The fatigue, muscle pain, and difficulty concentrating have been bothering her for over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’s because of her depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said. The heart attack would seem to indicate that they missed something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s got to be something genetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What about Metabolic Syndrome X?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Insulin resistance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Syndrome X could cause a stroke, but I don’t know about a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could, if her blood pressure was high enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which is likely, considering her weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It fits the symptoms. Me likee. Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.  Oh, and one more thing. I’ve been told that I’ve got to get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week. New sheriff, belt tightening, you know how it goes. Okay, carry on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s some kind of game, House’s own version of “Punk’d”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not House, it’s Vogler. We can’t let it get to us, we’ve got to stick together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are you suggesting, we start slashing each other’s throats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m suggesting it’s a zero-sum game. Your loss is my win. That’s not conducive to team play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is what House seems to want. I'm with Cameron. May be a bad strategy, but I don’t want to give House his satisfaction. Come on, sick kid, remember?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>She’s diabetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, but it’s similar. MSX patients don’t respond normally to insulin, which causes her body to create too much, which causes metabolic abnormalities. We’re going to do a test to be sure, but there are certain dangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Is this thing treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s controllable through proper diet and exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Wait. Jessica already eats right. And she exercises every day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know you’ve already seen several nutritionists –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>And we’ve done everything they recommended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I understand, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Why can’t any of you doctors see past her weight? If diet and exercise are the treatment, then the diagnosis is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It might be, but the only way we’ll know is if you’ll let us do this test.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>It’s really bad, especially at night. It’s like my heart is on fire, like it’s, uh, oh, I don’t know, like it’s…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Burning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Exactly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm, sounds almost like heartburn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>So, can you give me something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like a thesaurus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I take it you never mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Prenatal? I’m not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, you don’t get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>I know when I’m pregnant, all right? I have six kids. That’s why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vasectomies can reverse themselves, condoms break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Okay.  This is what a woman is supposed to look like. Okay, we’re not just skin and bones. We have flesh. We have curves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have little people inside you.  Okay, okay, I’m sorry. I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Damn right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let’s see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Blood, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The heartburn, gotta make sure it’s not spreading.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>I don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The test involves some pretty precise measurements. If we don’t know exactly how much you weigh, we won’t get the right answers. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tell you a secret. When I was your age, I was heavy, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Were you over 100?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Way over. The kids in my neighborhood used to call me Rerun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Rerun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He was a heavy guy from TV. I used to pretend I liked it, but I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>How come you’re not heavy any more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ninth grade, grew five inches, everything kind of evened out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>You think that’ll happen to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, yeah! I mean, your mom’s tall, and you are a little short for your age. You’ll probably spring right up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Obesity isn’t something you just grow out of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Take it you’ve never seen a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s not a baby, she’s ten!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And you figure making her feel like crap would do her a world of good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, if it gets her off the couch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sure she’s already under enough pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not from mummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Everything in society tells us we have to be thin to be successful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, society tells you you have to be thin to be attractive. And guess what, that’s what attractive means: that society likes looking at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think we should be telling our kids it’s fine as long as they’re healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All right. You weigh 90 pounds because it makes you healthier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Forget it. He’s just cranky because he's the one who's going to get the axe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On what? Sharon’s plan for Gaza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Who you’re gonna let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, you should be able to pull that off. Most billionaires aren’t very good with numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It will be more cost-efficient once I’ve grabbed Cameron’s ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase… well, I can grab his ass, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You are uniquely talented in many areas, but office politics is not one of them. Don’t take Vogler on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just a little bit longer, and you’ll be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Like Dr. Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wanna put some money on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>I said I’m thirsty.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We understand you’re upset, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>You were supposed to be monitoring her condition. but instead you were bickering and placing bets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I apologize if we weren’t paying full attention to your daughter, but I assure you that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically sincere. And they didn’t screw it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m from the lab. The blood tests showed your daughter wasn’t hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis wasn’t caused by anything these doctors did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>So then what was it caused by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea, but you’ll be happy to hear it can’t be cured by diet or exercise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing that could also cause a heart attack. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume I don’t have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A hypercoaguable state could cause a blood clot. Blood clots can cause a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>More likely to cause a stroke, not the psychosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, you’re wrong. If the clot made it to the amygdala area of the brain, it might cause uncontrollable rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right, because anything’s possible, but nothing’s going to cause multiple clots in a kid this age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s fat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Obesity doesn’t cause blood clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Extremely obese patients can get a fat embolus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right, after they get liposuction which she’s clearly never had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because we have her medical records. And because no plastic surgeon in his right mind is going to give a ten-year-old liposuction!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She hasn’t had liposuction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her tox screen was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn’t show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her mother wouldn’t give her diet pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Yeah, she thinks her daughter’s perfect just the way she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prevent further clotting. And you,  find those pills.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not diet pills. You might want to broaden the search just a little. And don’t just ask the mom, if she hasn’t mentioned yet, she’s not gonna –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t give a damn what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference. You don’t even offer a medical opinion any more. Who would you fire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want your opinion.  Fine, it’s you.  Either way, you’re making a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wh- Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Anyone can make a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, it’s the money. You resent it, but you’re going to tell me he doesn’t need the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t appreciate the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He wants the job. He just doesn’t appreciate it. There’s nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out, but this is not the place to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You thought I’d pick Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn’t think you’d pick at all.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I guess he’s not the “rise above the fray” guy he likes to think he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You practically forced it out of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s scared of losing his job, just like everyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking. You’ve made it quite clear that you’re miserable here –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, I’m not going to interrogate them, but I just want to ask if Jessica ever mentioned anything. It’s pretty important, she’s very sick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He asked for time to complete performance reviews on everyone in his department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>And you told him no and gave him how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A week. He’ll do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Guy’s never done what he’s told. Don’t see why he’s going to start now.  Hi! Edward Vogler. Is Dr. House claiming that I’m forcing him to get rid of one of you? I assume his goal is to stir up antagonism toward me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And your goal is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I am forcing him. I’ll do whatever I can to ease the transition for whoever he chooses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If you’re feeling guilty about your decision, there is an easy solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I don’t feel guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then why approach me and tell me all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I don’t feel guilty, that doesn’t mean I don’t feel bad. I’m rich, but I’m still human.  I just wanted you to know that if there’s anything I can do for you, my door’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You looking for info? Thought you already had House all figured out?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s actually a personal record for this clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> But it’s completely benign, there’s no sign of cancer at all. I’ve already spoken with Dr. Bergin, and he’s available first thing in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>For what? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>For the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>But if it’s not cancer, it can’t kill me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> …No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>I’ll have a huge scar! I won’t be able to wear a bikini!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Yeah, you got a problem with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, but I’ve never gone swimming with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>I knew it. That’s what this is all about! You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>It’s not gonna kill me.  The only thing surgery is going to do is change the way I look. That is the definition of “cosmetic surgery”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh, it would also relieve your heartburn and discomfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Yeah, right. Why give an antacid when you can cut someone up and make them look a little easier on your eyes?  My husband loves my body. He can’t get enough of it.  you think he’s gonna want to touch me if I look like I’ve been gutted like a fish? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That was unexpected.</content></utterance>

She says she’s exercising, but everyone knows it’s just because no one wants to play with her. I mean, I’m only her buddy because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Clementine</speaker><content>Heh, she told you that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Clementine</speaker><content>I totally busted her for taking drugs one day. She totally lied, said they were diet pills her mom had given her. Come on, get real. No way a girl like that is taking diet pills.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why would she lie?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>I took them. From the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Why? Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Because I didn’t want to be ugly anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sure that if everyone I knew hated me, I couldn’t bear to look at me. I wouldn’t go so far as to shoplift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m not talking about the shoplifting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m sure she didn’t even know they were dangerous. She probably saw them advertised on TV or over the internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right, so I guess it’s the media and pharmaceutical companies’ fault now?  Not the fact that she can’t stop shoving food down her throat. No one forced her to get fat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Have you seen the latest research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, I have. What I haven’t seen lately is a kid eating an apple or riding a bike. You Americans can’t even compete with the rest of the world in basketball anymore, unless, of course, it’s the type you play with a remote control on a big screen TV.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Diet pills don’t cause skin necrosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be something related to the pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or both. Diet pills brought her to us, we gave her the sores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think she got a staph infection from something here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not saying the hospital gave the sores, I’m saying we did. By treating her. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who gave her the heparin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I gave warfarin, she gave heparin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure you didn’t both give her warfarin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yes, I did not screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin?  Enough said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were standing right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was preparing my own dose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, right. There’s gotta be some other cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>None that I can think of. Let’s fix the mistake. Give her unfractionated IV heparin and low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection stat. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Making me look bad is not going to save your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think you’re incapable of making a mistake?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House isn’t just going to protect you because you kiss his ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey! Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the patient’s.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>She sleeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As a result of the sedatives, yeah. Can’t let her wake up, too much pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content> “Warfarin-induced skin necrosis”. I have no idea what that means. But it says here we gave her the warfarin, and I do know what “induced” means… we did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>At this point it’s not exactly clear. You know, I should probably talk to Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Oh, you two need time to get your story straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t tell me what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>So you don’t just blindly follow his commands. You’re your own man. And yet, here you are working for a man you can’t stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I respect him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>What exactly is it you respect? His attitude toward humanity? He thinks we’re all idiots and liars. How ‘bout his attitude toward you, plays with you like a cat with a ball of string –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I want to know if you want to keep your job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>That’s not an answer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Boss.  What was that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wanted to know what warfarin is. I don’t know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Brrrr. Icy. Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Correct all you want. Of course, it’s a bit more productive if there’s an actual mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, I always forget that part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I gave her the heparin, which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin, which is probably why she’s not responding to your treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yet.  If you didn’t screw up, then what is it? You don’t have an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When you come up with something, let me know. I’ll be in the clinic, warming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I’m the only one who’s always stood behind you when you’ve screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because I’m not insanely insecure. And because I can actually trust in another human being and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you said you weren’t angry. Who would you fire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Figures you’d try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The problem is, the world doesn’t work that way just ‘cause you want it to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Figures you’d stall and refuse to deal with the issue. Problem is, the world doesn’t go away just because you want it to. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>He’s not gonna fire anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. I’m going to cut the pay of all four of us. 17% across the board will allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money. I believe it’s what you suits call “win-win”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>All right, if you can –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>This is not a negotiation, it never was. I need to know that whatever I ask you to do, no matter how distasteful you find it, you’ll do it. And just as importantly, you need to know that. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have kids! How novel! That changes everything. So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I believe that you are the only one to express feelings. And if we’re going to look at this from a first-year psych point-of-view, maybe you want me to fire you. Maybe that’s why you’re acting weird. You –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re the one being different! You’re always pushing things, pushing the rules, pushing us, but not this time. You just jumped on this idea like a life raft. Not one question about what else it could be, no riding us for other answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then why aren’t you watching TV? Or playing your damn Game Boy, or whatever else you have fun doing by yourself? Maybe I should just quit. Make it easy for everyone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious.  Cute kids. Love her green eyes. And his baby blues. Of course, since you and your husband have brown eyes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>Where’d you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From the father of three, maximum four of your six children. So I’m thinking maybe the reason you don’t want surgery is, while your husband may find you attractive no matter what, all the other men you’re sleeping with might not be so open-minded. Which brings me back to my original thesis: men are pigs. You got nothing to worry about. You know, pretty much have sex with anyone, fat, skinny, married, single, complete strangers, relatives –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Lucille</speaker><content>You? You’re sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So are you. I’m sure there are websites full of men looking for married women with surgical scars.  So have the surgery. Please?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If he picks me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Sure. Foreman’s smarter, House has got a thing for Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ve been feeding you information so you’ll protect me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I will protect you as long as I need you. And you will feed me information as long as you need me. I spoke with Cameron because if I have alternatives, I don’t need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s not gonna rat on House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Foreman ever said anything about talking to me? Interesting.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think we should get her into surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Assume that Cameron didn’t screw up. What if it’s not the warfarin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It has to be. The sores presented right after we –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, right, right, but let’s just say it’s not. Come on, come on, what have you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Can I have a second to think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, there’s no time to think! Say the first thing that comes to you head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Enough already, okay? We’ve got it, you hate fat people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We already considered obesity as a cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So did all her other doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, what if it’s not a cause? What if it’s a symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis? Listen, I don’t care if it makes sense, just give me something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ulcers secondary to vaculitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that’s just sores, not obesity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pyoderma gangrenosum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More sores. Okay, let’s look at it from the other side. What has obesity as a symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hypothyroidism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Genetics are more likely. Her mom’s heavy, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s not just heavy. She’s tall. We have any history on the dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah. 6’1”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid’s short. We’ve got stunted growth, high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity – it’s Cushing’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, necrosis doesn’t present in –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In rare cases Cushing’s can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin. It’s perfect. It explains everyting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Except it’s not Cushing’s. She’s had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn’t catch it in the right phase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ll have to do another UFC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s no time! We’ve got less than an hour to make the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-31"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we treat for Cushing’s and we’re wrong, she’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we assume it’s not Cushing’s, she’ll lose her breasts and may still be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing on the adrenals. Heard Cameron went home, she sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Go back to the pituitary views. She seemed okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Think she’s got another reason for leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I hope so. Wait, stop. There.  What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s Cushing’s.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The tumor causes Cushing’s. Cushing’s messes with hormone production. Hormones control everything: growth, weight –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Can you fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’ll need surgery to remove the tumor. Once it’s gone, everything will get normal very fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>No mastectomy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The surgery’s dangerous. The pituitary is located between the caverns of the sinuses, basically right between the eyes. The area contains the nerves that control eye movement and the major arteries that feed the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your surgeon will approach the gland transphenoidally.  An incision will be made under the lip in which he’ll insert a fiberoptic microscope. Once the tumor’s found, he’ll cut it into small pieces and remove it from the same hole under the lip. The whole procedure should take about three hours and your daughter should be able to go home in a few days. The sores will go away, as well as her fatigue and her muscle pain. She’ll even start losing weight.</content></utterance>
