<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>The trick to onions — cut them in half length-wise, but leave the roots on. Then make your vertical slices.  Need a dozen. Think you can handle this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>A dozen is 12, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content> Next, we add mustard greens — spicy, and they pack a nice punch. Plus, they're really good for you. Improve mental function, protect against rheumatoid arthritis. Even inhibit certain types of cancer.  Are you going to chop those onions or give them a Thai massage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Well, I guess a happy ending is out of the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>I don't recall adding making snide remarks to your list of duties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Just taking initiative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content> Secret ingredient: Porcini mushrooms. You want to reconstitute them in bowl of water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content> Just give me a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>You're kidding me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>So sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>Are you okay? You want to sit down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>My lips are blue. Cyanosis.  Pain in my back and chest. Spontaneous pneumothorax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I'm a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chef Anthony</speaker><content>You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>And I need a doctor.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You drool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know gas is expensive, but I could've given you a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Elevator's broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It was fine when I came up from admitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dana Miller, the cancer researcher. Spontaneous pneumothorax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Awfully thin file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She just got admitted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lots of things can cause pneumothorax. Why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We wanna take this case. She's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She hasn't suffered from COPD. She doesn't smoke. She hasn't been scuba diving. O2 sats are low even after chest tube insertion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pneumothorax could be secondary to a bunch of things. Cystic fibrosis, lung cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or, to be slightly more optimistic, late-onset asthma triggered by an unknown allergen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We have a case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you just get to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Am I in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you take the elevators up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> So, steroids for asthma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Do a CT looking for hyperinflation to confirm. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I thought my hospital was high-tech. I'd have to wait all day for a CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dr. House gets a few perks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>He has his own scanner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, just very loose interpretations of hospital procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I appreciate the extra effort, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Our gift to society. We want to get you back to work as soon as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Well, I'm not working. At least not as a doctor I quit. I left eight months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You mean, like, a sabbatical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I had a uterine myoma. Benign. But it ruptured and I needed emergency surgery. I was lying there on the table thinking, "I can't die now. I haven't been happy yet."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Couldn't you just buy an overpriced German sports car, or have an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>My sports car is doing what I want when I want. Right now I'm learning how to run a kitchen from one of the best chefs in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're washing pots and smashing garlic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Smashing garlic makes me happy. Before that it was eight years studying, 12 years in that lab. It was always what I was supposed to do, and never what I wanted to do. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Come here. Look at this. Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Adorable. Elevators keep crashing. Is Mercury in retrograde or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Elevators can be capricious. Sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you. She keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumbwaiter. But then they had to leave it at home with an elevator sitter, because you drove the replacement elevator to quitting because, you're incapable of listening to anybody but me. That's just a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're wrong. I don't even listen to you. Either do your job or go home. Leave me out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I am gonna do my job. It doesn't mean I have to do it happily. Doesn't mean I have to do it without resentment. And it definitely doesn't mean I have to do it without seeking vengeance on the person making me be here. Congratulations. You've officially dragged me down to your level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, Blue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It’s not asthma. Lung volume is normal. She did have a uterine myoma removed eight months ago. Central line IV could have made a hole near the lung that slowly expanded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No pleural thickening. I can't believe she quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>People have the right to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I saw a four-year-old with retinoblastoma on my oncology rotation. The cancer had eaten through her eye and into her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Horrible diseases exist. It doesn't mean people should give up recreational anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why not? Big picture — I don't care if Jonas Salk’s life is a miserable shell. I just want him to cure polio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't live your life "big picture." You've gotta look out for yourself and the people you care about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Well, then, why are you a doctor? Why aren't you sitting by a pool in Fiji knocking back mai tais?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People act in their own self-interests. You're all here because you're happy to be here. Or at least because it's your best option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I'm here because I want to help people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people. Taub and Foreman are here because they've got no other viable choices. And Thirteen is desperate to make her life matter before it's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So... you're happy to be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Are those... increased interstitial markings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be pulmonary fibrosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do a biopsy.  Foreman. "You've got to look out for the people you care about." That wouldn't have anything to do with you screwing over your clinical trial by slipping Thirteen the real drug would it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You said that would be stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's nothing to know. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Got it?  Good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Just a headache. I took some ibuprofen, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where's the pain, front or back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Front. Why are there never any interesting pictures on these cards? They should make a dirty version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A sharp pain, or more of a throbbing —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Relax, it's not a side effect. People get headaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>True, but I can get you an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If I'm on the drug, it's been weeks. It's not like something's going to suddenly crop up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. First card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Train, duck...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Piano. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We need a biopsy to confirm —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>You need an open-lung biopsy to confirm pulmonary fibrosis. That's invasive surgery. I'd be out of commission for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No offense, but you're not working. What does it matter if you spend a little time in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Not working doesn't mean I don't have places to go. I've got my book group, piano lessons, cooking classes. They make me happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A warm apple fritter makes me happy. It doesn't fulfill me as a person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>And working here does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If it didn't, I’d have found a way to go back to tucking tummies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Well, good for you. If your job fulfills you and makes you happy, that's rare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I didn't say I was happy. I loved being a plastic surgeon. The money, the life style, and in a lot of ways this job stinks. I'm making five bucks, I’m always annoyed... but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>You can look yourself in the mirror and think, "I did something worthwhile today."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>That's important. And I do miss that. But it just wasn't enough anymore.  That doesn't feel right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sit up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Oh, that's weird.  What is it? Ascites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Your belly's full of blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. Just practicing my clown college audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Someone set a trip wire. We were with the patient the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We were in the GRC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lung, liver, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope — anybody bother MRIing our patient's liver for tumors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, no tumors, no cysts, no clear etiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you're not obsessing, you must have already figured it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. So I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our patient's liver suddenly sprang a leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe. Could be a granuloma.  Erodes into the hepatic artery, causes the bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What caused the granuloma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Blastomycosis. Could have been asymptomatic for months. It hits her lungs, we give her steroids. It blossoms and attacks her liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick children who need her soufflés can breathe easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I told you, I didn't —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then you really have a problem. The way she turned her head to look at the MRI... I think she's losing her peripheral vision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because she turned her head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm happy for you. A love so deep you're ready to chuck your medical license to give her powerful, unproven drugs with dangerous side effects. I don't want to make any assumptions about your feelings for me, but I do have a birthday coming up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I hear Cuddy's SEAL training finally came in handy. Should I be investing in a flak jacket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No carpet bombing? No burning of Dresden to teach her a lesson? Well, since you're incapable of taking the high road, I assume there's some deeper, more long-term strategy in effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy's not playing games. She's not looking for leverage. She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And your counter-move is to let her have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The only time to strike back is when I want something. All I want now is to get things back to normal. Which I can't get by escalating. The only way to win this war is to lose it. Let her punch herself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, that makes sense too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Too"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was thinking you actually feel guilty about taking her away from her baby. But your explanation's good too. It's completely inconsistent with your character, but whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, rationalization man. You have saved the village. You wanna eat? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You forgot your file.  Dana Miller? The cancer researcher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not anymore. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Dr. Miller, I doubt if you'll remember me —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>James Wilson, right? Chicago, the adenocarcinoma conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Impressive. You want some cortisone for that itch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Liver failure. Itching is one of the lovely side effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why did you quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Well, the worst thing is now every time I get sick, I have to listen to a dozen people judge me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you want me to congratulate you? I've got four kids in pede-onc right now who are gonna die. Three of them within a year, the other in a few days, probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Breakthroughs will happen. With or without me, someone will find the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe.  I — I... I'm in the trenches. I'm — I'm doing triage as best I can. You had the chance to end the war. How is someone like me supposed to keep fighting when someone like you just... walked away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>When I left my job, a lot of people were furious with me. It was easier to be angry than to admit they weren't happy. That they were stuck in a rut somewhere in their lives, unable to move forward. What's your rut?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, you're freaking me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you think we should have kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> We've had this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ten years ago. Things change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>On our third date I told you that I didn't want to have kids, and you said that you were okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I said it because I wanted to sleep with you. And then I fell in love with you. And I realized that I really could be okay with it. It wasn't like I had this burning desire to have children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God, have you been resenting me all this time? Is that why —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. Of course not. I'm just... revisiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> This isn't a whim for me. It's not a decision that I made lightly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Don't you ever wonder what it would be like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All the time. Just not enough to make me want to do it. I like our life. Are you okay? Can I turn the TV back on? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look straight ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why didn't we do this test this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm losing my peripheral vision?  I am on the drug. Does this mean you have to tell them and take me off it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, and yes. As far as they're concerned, you're on the placebo. I found out last week. The trial was getting positive results... So I switched you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So my headaches... I'll stop taking the drug, and everything should be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Specimen's negative for blastomycosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I'll go give House the test results. You can tell the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> We've been dating for two weeks. You just broke trial protocol and risked your entire career to give me a drug we're not even sure will help me. I don't think I'm ready for that. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Dr. Miller? I'm sorry. The test was negative. So I'm gonna take you off — what happened to your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I don't know. I was sleeping. It's so itchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You were scratching it in your sleep.  You scratched right through your skull. This is brain matter. Need some help in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I did a free flap closure to avoid any scarring. She was lucky — the scratching didn't cause any brain damage. But the first thing she said when we woke her up was, “It still itches.” </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin. Which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So the problem's in her brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Thank God we have you here to interpret that for us. Sorry, I have a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could be psychogenic. She made a big, sudden change in her life. Could be the result of a mental imbalance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She wants to do what she wants to do. What's crazy about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why do you have to quit to do it? If I want to do something, I do it. If you can figure out a balance, there's no burnout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks for the lesson, Deepak. The itching started yesterday, not eight months ago. Meningitis, encephalitis... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Those are diffuse processes. This is localized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be plaques. MS would explain, possibly the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So would a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, how 'bout we stop guessing and MRI her head instead?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want to talk about your headaches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not particularly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You went off the drug, but the headaches are worse. You need an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> The patient needs an MRI. If she had gangrene, would you be amputating my leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Those pills have codeine in them? You're taking twice the indicated amount.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I've only been off the drug for 24 hours, so I think the bigger issue here is that I've been off you for 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have worsening headaches, loss of peripheral vision, and a long history of pretending bad things aren't happening. You really think this is just about my hurt feelings?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't remember demoting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I brought you something. The latest issue of “Parent” magazine. Really interesting column. Apparently, working moms are actually more engaged and attentive than stay-at-home moms. Something about personal fulfillment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> That's just a rationalization by working moms to justify not being with their kids. Which is fine, if that's what they want. It's not what I want.  And this is “Nurses Quarterly.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The point is —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're only here to get back at me by dumping dirty mop water on my carpet. Just get it over with so I can get back to work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I'm sorry. I figured... only one of us needed to go out on a limb. I thought I could help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's hard to have a conversation when I'm trying not to move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Oh, God.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient's MRI was negative. No tumors, no lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where's your cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where are your coworkers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I paged them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It could still be psychogenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Technically, it can't still be that, because it never could be that. She scratched through her skull while she was sleeping. Unless she was having a dream about fleas —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, hey, funny you should drop by. We were just talking about this patient of ours. Tell him the part about where two of her doctors don't show up —  Where are you going?   Polyneuropathy. It's not in the brain, it's in the nerves. It explains the itching, the lungs, the liver. Shock the affected area, reboot the nerve — she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Foreman. How bad is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> She's got a tumor in her optic chiasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't need your coat to treat a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm going to the drug company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the patient's health? That's a great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They have records on hundreds of patients. I can ask them for access, find out if other patients developed tumors and how they were treated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This drug inhibits cell death. I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stop taking it? Yeah. She tried that yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?  If you get on that elevator, and it's only 'cause you're worried about getting to sleep tonight —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I want to be able to tell her this happened to other people, and they're fine now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not gonna lie to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A little late for that.  You need to wait. Because if this thing doesn't go away, she's gonna need you to still have a medical license.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So I spoke with House. He thinks we should just —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> My leg is bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I was going for the phone, and I fell over the table. I can't see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I can't see anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You gonna tip housekeeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Get it from Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't tell me — she burned your apartment to the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Warmth would have been nice. No heat, no power. Apparently Mrs. House called the utilities and told them we were moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You have 17 messages.  And your non-involvement strategy doesn't seem to be working.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hang up, he's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We've been paging you all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By all means, let's discuss the failed attempts to contact me, not the reason behind them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient started experiencing spinal shocks before the machine was turned on. L’Hermitte's sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shocks without shock, an itch that won't stop. She needs Dr. Seuss. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>L’Hermitte's sign could mean Behcet's, B-12 deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No sores, no anemia. Where's Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could be another demyelinating disease. Why are you asking about Foreman and not Thirteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because both questions are bound to have the same answer. Ebony and ivory are joined near the hip. Forget the brain. Look lower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The spinal tumor wouldn't explain the liver or the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But an aggressive spinal hemangioma could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go find it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't answer the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Probably because I didn't want to talk to anyone. You can leave your stolen key on your way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was looking for Foreman. I figured...  You can't see. Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>On his way to the drug company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Tell him to come back. I'll dial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If they can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He asked for my advice before he switched you off the placebo. I told him to do it if he loved you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He only thinks he loves me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the same thing. Yes, he's an idiot. You didn't ask him to do anything. You're pissed off that he did. So let him torch his career to pay for his sins. Unless, you actually feel something for the idiot. In which case, you might want to tell him to turn around. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're hurting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Good, after all the stunts he's pulled on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're physically hurting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's the point? What do you think you're going to accomplish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House shouldn't be allowed to make people miserable without paying for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're not miserable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're telling me how I feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're here because you like this. You like working with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wow, if only I'd known I was having fun, I wouldn't have canceled the bouncy house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fire him, and go be home with your new baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I like what he does for this hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What he does is who he is. And the same goes for you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Slow down. Unless you want to radiate her heart instead of her brain. Of course, then your problems would actually all go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thanks. I'm not beating myself up enough already over this. Entering the left common carotid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You broke the rules. Girlfriend went blind. You gotta be ready for losing to be one of the possibilities. You're at the carotid bifurcation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I knew that giving her the drug would be bad for me if I got caught. I never thought it would be bad for her. Nobody else was having adverse reactions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You did it because you love her. Ironically, you never took her into consideration. Can't wait to see what you get her for your anniversary. Catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm. We're in position.  Nukey, nukey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What's going on with everyone today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It involves House, Foreman, and Thirteen, which means it's either dumb, dangerous, or tragic, or a combination. I'm embracing my ignorance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> House was right about the hemangioma. Looks fixable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> What's that? Hemangiomas travel solo. This thing has brought a friend. Masses in her lungs and spine. One in her pericardium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>They're everywhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Classic mesothelioma. It metastasized outward to the spine and muscles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah, the irony of it. Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other lazy cancer researcher hadn't gone home early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where are Foreman and Thirteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shouldn't you be saying, "Those weren't there when we scanned her two days ago?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good rephrasing. Have Wilson do a biopsy to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No. Something weird is going on. It involves our colleagues — we should know. You want us to treat the patient, tell us what's going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Actually, all he needs us to do is tell Wilson to do something. So... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You always blab to watch people react. So not blabbing means you don't want us to react, which can't be good. Is Thirteen's headache not just a headache? If I check with Admitting, am I gonna find her name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>A little pinch. I'm sorry about the other day. I... unloaded on you. And...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>You're not sorry. You feel bad because mesothelioma means I'm dying. You're a good person. I appreciate the sentiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not apologizing because you're dying. I'm apologizing because you were right. I am stuck. My girlfriend died. She was the only person I've loved for a long time, and... I'm still living in her apartment. I'm surrounded by her things. I have left it all exactly where it was. I don't know how to get unstuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>The only wrong thing is... to do nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yeah.  All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>That's not supposed to happen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Have you thought about going to the drug company, see if they can help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We need to give it more time. It's been half a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This thing keeps growing, there's other stuff in your brain you might need later on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If I were any other patient, you'd both be in the lounge, eating donuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not any other patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Right. Any other patient, you don't feel guilty. But you don't get to torch your career to pay for your sins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House told you to say that, didn't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Does that make it any less true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think he's right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Who cares? You're a hypocrite. You don't ask her if she wants to be on the drug, but when there's a chance you could help her get better, suddenly you're letting her call the shots? That's not being noble. That's saving your own ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'd feel worse if he destroyed his career.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what causes masses that do bleed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>AVM's secondary to schistosomiasis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She'd be crawling with worms. We'd have noticed it. Gorham's disease and Kasabach-Merritt can both cause super-aggressive vascular tumors.  Patient's heart just stopped. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what causes that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cardiac tamponade. She's bleeding into her pericardium, smothering her heart. Syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>BP’s going back up. It's working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, it's not — look.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're transfusing platelets, FFP, everything to try to keep her stable. But we can barely keep up with the blood loss. At this rate, she could be dead by the end of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We need to resect the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too late — no surgeon's gonna touch her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So we give up? Just let her bleed out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't be silly. You know what that would do to our malpractice insurance rates? We go on the offensive. Cut off the invading army's supply line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're talking about embolization?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cut off the arteries that feed blood to the tumors, they wither and die.  Start with the ones in her lungs. If they get any bigger, she's gonna have a hard time breathing. So she'll have a hard time telling us she's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can't kill the tumors without also killing healthy tissue. If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's hope that running marathons wasn't on her happy list. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thought I'd never see you again. Little, little Greg. Yeah, you heard me right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You are who you are. It's annoying, but... it's not your fault. It isn't about you. I… I… I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you were doing this job perfectly until the baby came along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What? I'm apologizing. Can't you just accept my —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I accept. We gonna have to do this dance again in 28 days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're practically weeping on my shoulder. I can only assume that what I'm hearing is your aunt flow telling me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>When I was being a jerk, you suddenly act human. But when I act human, you turn back into a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is your way of saying you accept my apology, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappy job before; you will do a slightly crappier job now. Everything keeps going. Nature of life. Nature of parenthood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or this whole thing is just an act. And you've gone back to the part you think you need to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You should go talk to Wilson. Rationalization Man needs a faithful sidekick. Now, Rational Man needs to go save a life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House. If you're looking for returnable bottles, Kutner’s already cleaned it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn! Oh, well.  That means the only thing I'm gonna get out of this... Is a diagnosis. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So the nurses gave her pads instead of tampons. Is that diagnostically relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fact that the nurses had to give her anything is. Means she's bleeding from her uterus. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Women do that. It's perfectly natural. Not scary at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She menstruating and, she's bleeding everywhere. There's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance it's a coincidence. Which leaves a much bigger chance that the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis. She had a myoma eight months ago. Surgeons cut through her uterine wall. Every cut of the scalpel could have sent endometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream. Some of them took up residence in her lungs, some in her liver, some in her spine. And like all horny little cells, they went forth and multiplied till they reached a critical mass. In the days leading up to her next period, when her uterus is supposed to swell, everything swelled. And when her uterus was supposed to bleed, everything bled. Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period. Granted, it's the worst period ever. Although, frankly, not by all that much. Cut out the masses, she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Can't do surgery until her cycle's over and she stops bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let's hope she can hold out till then. In the meantime, get her a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a DVD of “Beaches”. </content></utterance>
