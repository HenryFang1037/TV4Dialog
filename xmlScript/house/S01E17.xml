<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> And the only thing wrong – the only thing wrong with the American dream is people. Too many people. Too many of us telling young people that the dream is dead. They told me that when I was growing up in the slums of Trenton, and they were wrong. They told me that when I decided to run for Senator with only $58 in my savings account and they were wrong! And they are still telling me that now, that I don’t have a chance: because I’m black, because I don’t have the right nose, because I still have only $58 in my savings account.  With your help, we can keep that dream alive.  And in closing –  – just… let me say… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Staffer</speaker><content>Let ME say that you should all donate the legal maximum to the next President of the United States!  Are you okay, do you need some water or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>No, no, I’m fine, I’m fine, really. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>A handsome guy like you, I bet you get 70% of the women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Heh, here’s hoping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>Of course, it helps your wife died of cancer.  I mean, I’m sorry, but the sympathy vote’s in your pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Yeah, I appreciate your support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>Listen, Senator, my union has a hell of a war chest. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Um, I’ve always been strong on the union. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>The thing is, you always go on in your speeches about the workers in Indonesia, Cambodia, Timbuktu –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Because I think we have… a moral, uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>My union members are hurting. They don’t care about moral this or moral that. Are you all right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Various staffers</speaker><content>Senator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Union Guy</speaker><content>Hey!  The guys are gonna love that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Various staffers</speaker><content>Tell him to breathe! Give him some room! Senator, are you all right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>The Senator’s suffering from nausea, headache, and mental confusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>You’re being childish. Look, if his case is as trivial as you think it’ll take you three minutes to diagnose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>You’re mad at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Nope. I never liked Cameron or Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Do you know why I’m forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you’re a team player. Now, if you did that, you wouldn’t need to go through this exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll hold the Senator’s hair while he upchucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content> Oh, and by the way, I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference. Next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t do speeches. I’m shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has developed a new ACE inhibitor. I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals… wait a second, don’t I own that company? Oh, no, that’s right, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version. All there in the study. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know its price tag is significantly improved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content> You can either give one ten minute talk and one three minute diagnosis or you can fire one of your pets. My understanding was that you believed in rationality above all else. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Viopril…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I appreciate your keeping the media way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re keeping your staff away as well. You’re taking it easy, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I’m in the middle of a campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The faster we can get you better, the faster you can get out of here. Anyone else at the fundraiser get sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I don’t think so. And I don’t think that’s it, I’ve been under the weather for weeks, you know. Lots of traveling, supposed to be in the Sudan next week. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Helps me concentrate.  Even better than drugs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Open your mouth, please.  That’s quite a scar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>When I was six, I fell off the swings and bit my tongue. Couldn’t talk right for the longest time. Lots of teasing. But, you know, it just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>You find sincerity annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re a black kid from the ghetto who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate. That’s a sufficiently mythical story, you don’t need to lie about your tongue.  Must have missed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>What’s wrong?  What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not the food. It’s your brain.  Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture.  Cancel your travel plans.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The LP showed no sign of infection and the MRI was fairly clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I guess we can tell him he’s fairly healthy and can go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, there is something in Broca’s area, but it’s small, low intensity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Most likely just background nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Care to bet your job on that?  What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What was what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But last week you didn’t get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It’s weird, it’s almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chase has nothing to worry about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>None of you has anything to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented. The lesion could be nothing. It could also be a brain tumor or infection. There’s only one way to find out which.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You wanna cut into his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dangerous, I know. Especially as he’s a politician, his brain’s all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not pregnant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Well, I told you that. But there’s gotta be some other reason I’m still spotting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone levels, you had a miscarriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I haven’t even been on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Right, since it’s physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I haven’t had sex since I split up with my husband. That was almost a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Um, what do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, it’s obvious. Start a religion. [He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>In my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re not doing a brain biopsy on a spot on a MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where’d you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not on an United States Senator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, just so I’m clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A brain biopsy can cause permanent neurological damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make ‘em grow big and strong. It’s my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re pulling rank on patient care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s not my call, either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either it’s a tumor or it’s an infection that the lumbar puncture didn’t pick up. Either way, if we don’t treat it immediately, it could kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or it could be nothing. Reading brain MRIs is not an exact science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>W-what caused my s-symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow, excellent question. Many doctors wouldn’t have gone there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It could be a transient ischemic attack. You could make the argument for watching carefully for the time being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mmm, but you’d only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s absurd, and insulting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Insulting, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>W-what will the voters think? If they find out I’ve had a b-brain biopsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you’re worried about NASCAR dads?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not a bacterial infection, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So you biopsied his brain for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If that were true, would Dr. Wilson’s mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s toxoplasmosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS. They’re gonna love that in Dubuque.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Toxoplasmosis is a fairly common fungus you can get from eating undercooked meat or touching cat feces. In rare cases the fungi travel up the blood stream and into the brain causing a lesion or inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> So, what’s the prognosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Toxo usually responds to treatment, but it only causes a lesion in your brain if your immune system is extremely weak to begin with. Senator, I’m afraid you have AIDS. As I’m sure –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As I’m sure you know, people with HIV can live a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>What else could do this to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Theoretically, certain cancers –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> I do not have AIDS. I don’t sh-sh-shoot up drugs, I don’t sl-sleep with…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize. But we’ve gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>You haven’t even tested me for HIV!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> We will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But the toxo drugs are going to piss off your fungi, and when fungi get pissed – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I am not gonna take the pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you’re not going to become President either way. They don’t call it the White House because of the paint job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re going to give me the drugs for the toxo only. You are going to test me for HIV under a false name. You are going to test me for cancer and anything else that could have done this to me. If I have cancer, I will deal with it, but I do not have AIDS.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>“Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals are pleased to announce that Dr. Gregory House will present the latest research on their exciting new ACE inhibitor.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You’re making that up. That’s Vogler’s company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Press release. Doing an address at the North American Cardiology Conference. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House never gives speeches. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But when I really believe in something… Gosh dang it, I’ve got a chance to make a difference here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You made a deal with Vogler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s all the rage. Everybody’s doing it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So, what’s the deal? You get to keep all of us if you plug his products?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One speech, no biggie. Foreman’s doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cancer? The Senator’s got AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELISA test for HIV. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thank you. For the speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat’s the word you doctors use, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know it’s hard for you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Double stat? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This may sting a little.  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>It wasn’t the shot, it’s, um, my head, it’s killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know, Senator, we don’t have to do this now. We can wait until your HIV test comes back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> Guess you figure it’s gonna come back positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, in my experience –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Patients lie. Politicians lie more. And black politicians –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa, I don’t think black politicians lie more than white politicians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>We lie less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You figure we’re morally superior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> I’ve got my theories. No, we, we just can’t get away with it. No one’s gonna gi-give us the benefit of the doubt. No one’s gonna cut us a second chance. And, and when it happens it’s not just a bad politician, it’s, it’s, it’s a bad role model, it’s a dis-discredit to the race.  You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Take a deep breath. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House. I just wanted to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re welcome, again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I want you to know how much I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got it. You’re grateful. Apparently you seem to think it’ll mean a lot to me to know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you know why people believe in God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you didn’t believe in God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then you better be making a very good point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that’s great, but just so you know, I’ve never made a tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I thank you because it means something to me. To be grateful for what I receive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are the most naïve atheist I’ve ever met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Clinic nurse</speaker><content>Dr. House, you have a patient in Room One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank God.  People pray so that God won’t crush them like bugs. I’m not gonna crush you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>It could be leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Definitely possible. The more likely diagnosis is hickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Well, it can’t be a hickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why is everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I’m not having sex. I’ve barely even thought about sex since my marriage.  Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I say you’re having sex, you say you’re not. Either you’re lying, or I’m wrong. Or there’s some middle ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>You mean like oral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I mean you’re having sex without knowing it. I’m testing you for booze, drugs and GHB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I don’t drink, and… what’s GHB?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The date rape drug. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s positive.  Your T-cell count is eight, which means there’s a good chance you’ll die. I’m telling you this because we need to contact your sexual partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I’ve only had two girlfriends. Two, after my wife died. I used c-c-condoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Some day there will be a black president. Some day there will be a gay president. Maybe there will even be a gay, black president. But one combination I do not see happening is gay, black, and dead. You need to stop lying to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, cut the crap, you’re dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>You’re clever, you’re witty, and you are a coward! You’re scared of taking chances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I take chances all the time, it’s one of my worst qualities.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wanting to believe the best about people doesn’t make it true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Being afraid to believe it doesn’t make it false.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that’s very moving. It’s a shame I don’t vote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>This is who I am. I believe in people. I’m not hiply cynical and I don’t make easy, snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why are you giving that speech next week?  We’re both just doing what we have to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you don’t see a problem with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Checking in on a patient? Yeah, wow, how do I look myself in the mirror?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s a ten minute speech!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That I’ve been ordered to give.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Vogler’s drug works!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, why do you have to make everything so dramatic? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I’m a very high-strung little lapdog.  Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Nuh uh. No pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>What’s going on?!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The antiretrovirals aren’t working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you don’t have AIDS.  The first test was a false positive. Happens one time in every five thousand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>You r-ran a second test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re still dying. The only difference is now we don’t know why.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s continuing to lose control of the muscles on his right side, his brain is getting foggier, and his T-cells are in the single digits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why are we doing this here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So Cuddy can’t find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy’s lied to his last constituent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> False negative on the PCR AIDS test?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Idiopathic T-cell deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Idiopathic, from the Latin meaning we’re idiots ‘cause we can’t figure out what’s causing it.  Give him a whole body scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You hate whole body scans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Cause they’re useless. Could probably scan everyone of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer. But, when you’re 4th-down, 100 to go, in the snow, you don’t call a running play up the middle. Unless you’re the Jets. </content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why did you order the second AIDS test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Standard procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, well, that’s you. Mr. Standard Procedure. You suspected the first test was a false positive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, but you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I should have ordered both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You were sure he had AIDS, then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What, what did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. And you believed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, he didn’t have any reason to lie –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Everybody lies, except politicians? House, I do believe you’re a romantic. You didn’t just believe him, you believed in him. Do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry?  Dr. Cameron’s getting to you. Well, I guess you can’t be around that much niceness and not get any on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that why you haven’t put the moves on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What makes you think I haven’t put the moves on her?  Oh. Oh, boy! You’re in trouble. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have restored my faith in the human race. You’re lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No, I’m not lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just got your results back. No GHB, no nothing. It means you’re having sex, and you’re lying about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No, and I have a new symptom. I have a rash on my butt.  Do you want to…  What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a carpet burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No! It can’t be! Doctor, I love sex. I miss it. I haven’t had any in over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No, I just wake up really exhausted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is something upsetting you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No.  My ex lives in the apartment downstairs. He’s always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals. Get out of my life, how much clearer can you get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it’ll get you away from your ex for a night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Quarter mil. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Lymphoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, or he’s had a cold in the last six months.  What, you’ve got her on speed dial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I just follow the scent of arrogance. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Another slightly enlarged node over here. Two more in his neck and one in his groin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And there’s a cyst in his liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Looks complex. Central necrosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spontaneous bleeding, it’s benign. I was rooting for a really cool tumor, instead we’re stuck with this crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. Once you find ‘em, you’ve gotta check ‘em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, knock yourselves out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I just saw Senator Wright, he looks like hell. That sushi must have been a lot worse than you thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Here’s a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Throw in a joke. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What ending?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me. You told Cuddy where I was. You told Vogler what I was doing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So how can I work with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, you don’t have a choice. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This might hurt a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. It’ll, uh, feel like a gentle massage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>House is a lousy teacher. You can’t lie for beans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Have you ever told any really big ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Oh, ho, I might be messed up, but I’m not that out of it, no no no no no… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Strap his arm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Am I gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I hope so.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am selling my soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said I was selling it. I didn’t say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they’ve done is added antacid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not the point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, of course it’s the point! He’s not asking you to lie, he’s not asking you to do something illegal –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s not asking me to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s not ordering you. He gave you a choice. You chose your staff. I know this isn’t easy for you. You’ll suffer. Vicodin sales in Jersey will triple. But you are doing a good thing.  Only you could feel like crap for doing something good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and lymph nodes all came back clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, not enough to indicate lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We never tested for hairy-cell leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, but we would have picked it up somewhere besides one lymph node.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And his spleen isn’t enlarged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Size isn’t everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let’s cut it open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can’t biopsy his spleen. It’ll bleed like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>In the Senator’s condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can’t tell the judge I had no idea of the risks involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His brain’s turning into mush, and he’s at risk for more infections, so we have to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, that’ll sound much better in court. Okay, go tell our human pincushion we’ll be sticking him one more time.  Cuddy. Don’t you hate doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You like me. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s kind of a sad question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t think that’s why you’re asking. I think it’s because of the speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh God, don’t try and pick me apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then why are you asking? What do you want to hear? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, Senator. We need to do one more biopsy, on your spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> I’ll have to sign lefty, my fingers aren’t working. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’ve been coughing a lot? Does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> It’s like I can’t get air. Is that from the toxo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> No, this is, this is new. You don’t need to sign, we can’t do the biopsy.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The Senator’s breathing is severely impaired. His O2 stat levels are at 89. His silver stain indicates pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Another killer fungus. It’s consistent with hairy-cell leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But we can’t biopsy his spleen. Respiratory distress? His platelets are 20 and dropping, his blood won’t clot worth a damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s gotta be another way to diagnose hairy-cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, his bone marrow’s indeterminate, spleen’s the only way to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don’t look for fish. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Why, Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They look for the blue heron, because there’s no way to see the fish. But if there’s fish, there’s gonna be birds fishing. Now, if he’s got hairy-cell, what else are we gonna see circling overhead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He should have all sorts of weird viruses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>HTLV and ATLV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can test for them. Run the titers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These were your brain waves at 2:45 AM. Now, here it comes, there’s an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep. This indicates partial sleep arousal. The most common type is somnambulism – sleepwalking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>That would explain why I’m so tired when I wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I had sex in my sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I’ll kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, but he probably didn’t know that you were asleep. Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose antidepressant. It’ll let you sleep better. If you want to save yourself the $15 co-pay, you can have sex while you’re awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>He’s my ex, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You live in the same building, you haven’t had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I’m sensing unresolved issues.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Negative for HTLV-1 and 2 and ATLV and everything else. It’s not hairy-cell.  Hey. You really gonna give that speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’ve got an opinion, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m a little surprised. Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re welcome. He’s positive for Epstein-Barr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what? It doesn’t point to hairy-cell, it’s irrelevant. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn’t fall off the swings when you were eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Six!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Give that back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh uh. We have to talk. You had an epileptic seizure. That’s how you bit your tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>I haven’t had a seizure since I was –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What medication did you take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>No seizure since I was six. No drugs since I was ten!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s it. Don’t worry about what the question is, don’t worry that you’re starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content> My mother used to call it physofin –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Phenytoin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Yeah!  Okay, okay, you’re okay, it’s okay. Everybody lies.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>CVID? That’s a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory problem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s pretty much a childhood disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Another reason why Chase’s suggestion was idiotic. He got it when he was a kid. Didn’t get any symptoms until now, it happens. It gets triggered by stress, like public speaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So you’re basing your diagnosis on a disease that’s relatively common and a drug he took thirty years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start the senator on IV immunoglobulin stat. If he gets better, I’m right, if he dies, you’re right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Antiretroviral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now say it three times fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We just got back your latest blood results. Your white cells are up, your T-cells are back over 100.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Well, that’s good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In a week? That’s terrific. You’ll need medication for the rest of your life, but other than that, you’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Am I well enough to run for president?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, why not run for pope while you’re at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Kennedy had Addison’s, FDR had polio. Two of the best presidents in the last hundred years –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If they were running today they wouldn’t stand a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>So, you figure you’d be Surgeon General if you didn’t have the limp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, there’s things I can’t do, and like you said, I have to live with reality.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>No, don’t get excited, he’s right, I, uh, I won’t win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then why run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>Senator</speaker><content>Oh, I see, your point being the only way to make a difference is to win every fight. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>But hey, why listen to me? I own the company, I’m certainly not to be trusted, right? Dr. Gregg House, on the other hand, has a reputation. For integrity, among other things.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gregg House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals’ extraordinary commitment to research excellence is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessman. A brilliant judge of people, and a man who has never lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it’s just more expensive.  A lot more expensive. See, that’s another example of Ed’s brilliance.  Whenever one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for everbody, right?  The patients, pish. Who cares, they’re just so damn sick! God obviously never liked them anyway.  All the healthy people in the room, let’s have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler!  I threw in a joke.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I should have taken a couple of extra Vicodin and just held my nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don’t need to worry about firing anyone. I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture? You trying to protect Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So this is just, “Don’t fire me, I quit.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m protecting myself. You asked me why I like you. You’re abrasive and rude, but I figured everything you do, you do it to help people. But I was wrong. You do it because it’s right.  There are only two ways I can deal with things. One is in my control. That’s to leave.  Goodbye, House. </content></utterance>
