<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>I have a question, and I need to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>Which would you like to do first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>The question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>Where's the bathroom?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>In case you get lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>Or in case somebody kidnaps us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>If somebody kidnaps Ian, he'll kidnap me too. I want to stay with the class.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'll call anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My stack's bigger than your stack.  You in or out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know that relative to their size, gorillas have smaller testicles than humans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well then you'd probably have an edge over a gorilla, but not over me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Reason is, primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you think there might be a better time to annoy me about my wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm talking about poker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Women are evil, you're right to drive them away. Call fold or raise, storytime can wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're smaller and better than chimps, bigger and worse than gorillas. For all our rationality, our supposed trust and fealty to a higher power, our ability to create a system of rules and laws; our baser drives are more powerful than any of that. We want to control our emotions, but we can't.  If we're happy, things don't annoy us. If on the other hand, we're sitting on crappy hold cards, little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more.  I raise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So are you going to tell me an annoying story everytime I raise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God that would be annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Dr Wells</speaker><content>Dr Cuddy, got one of your patients in the ER. Ian Alston, 6-yrs-old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Err, oh, I know him, what's the problem?  I'm all in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Dr Wells</speaker><content>Bloody diarrhea. Hemodynamically stable but he's been developing some co-ordination problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That sounds like gastroenteritis and dehydration. Order fluids and I'll take it on my service. Bet’s to you, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They scan his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Dr Wells</speaker><content>No, why would they scan--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don't play games. You gonna call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How's the heart rate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Dr Wells</speaker><content>Stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis. I'm not going anywhere.  Put the order in, and have someone tell Alan and Sarah that I'll be up when I'm done.  You in or out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh!  Stone cold bluff! You might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards, and a little less time staring at my breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Follow my finger with your eyes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content> How much longer will doctor Cuddy be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party, I'd say it's going to be at least 3 hours before she's even conscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Weren't you at the same party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don't drink. I want you to reach out and grab my cane. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content> What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your son's brain is losing control of his muscles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Dr Cuddy's message said it was just dehydration from diarrhea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's wrong. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>Is he going to be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>So were you in one of those cages?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No! No. No no no, those are for tourists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You were in the water with the Great White?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sure. It's no big deal, you just have to keep an eye on them. If they get too close, punch them in the nose, send them on their way.  I had you going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You are mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey! How's that anal fissure? Did it heal yet or is it still draining?  Oh, I'm sorry, didn't realise you'd come back for seconds. I figured that after the girl on the stairwell you'd be done for the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No Adam's apple, small hands. No surprises this time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> I'll er... see you later. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well you could have just said that, you didn't have to screw with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah if I didn't screw with you, you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid, which means you'd be useless. Better to extinguish all hope. Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me upstairs, stat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What's so urgent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two cases, same symptoms. What do 6-yr-olds and 70-yr-olds have in common?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Their immune systems don't work as well, could be Listeria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I already checked for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Leukemia has a higher prevalence in both young and old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So does asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No no no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could both be diabetes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No! The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle. What's weird is the kind of circle of life thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This kid doesn't have kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Based on this file, the kid just ate some bad food. Was the old man--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This case is 12 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And this case is Cuddy's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She assigned it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What were we talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two patients with two symptoms in common. And 5 symptoms not in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was...  In case any of you missed that class in med school, that one's untreatable. Kid's got the first two. Took Esther an hour and 20 mins to go from two to three. And less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is all because a child has some blood in his diarrhea. He's got a tummy ache, if there was any reason to think it was anything worse, Cuddy would be all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. Do a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>On a 6-yr-old kid who probably has nothing worse than some food poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you happen to find any purple papules, do me a favour and grab a slice. I want to check for Erdheim-Chester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A disease that there have been what, maybe 200 reported cases of, ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If Esther's family had let me to an autopsy, there'd be 201.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>See anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, and I don't expect to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House usually avoids cases. If he's actually stealing a case from Cuddy, there's gotta be a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's not the first time I've seen this file. About a month before Cameron was hired, some trucker came in here with these symptoms. House decided he was dying. Two days and a spinal tap, bone marrow extraction, and three colonoscopies later, we send the guy home with a bunch of painkillers and a diagnosis of a bad cheese sandwich. One of the guys who worked here before me said House tried to cure Esther at least 3 other times. You know how people see the Virgin Mary in danishes and stuff? Someone died 12 years ago and House doesn't know why. House sees that case now in... paint peeling and clouds and now this poor kid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Erdhem-Chester is an abnormal growth of some of the cells that fight infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Is that cancer? He seems ok now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>Yeah the other doctor kind of scared us about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He shouldn't have. We're just testing, it'll probably be negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>I don't understand. You don't think that's what it is but you want to do this thing to him anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need to be sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Isn't there any other way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It shouldn't take long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Those ridges look a lot like purple papules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They’re not purple, they're red. Probably just blood blisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give me the biopsy needle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How long is this going to take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Forget it Chase, your punching the shark story is good but she's not waiting for you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We couldn't confirm the source of the bleeding but we did biopsy some--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blood blisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean papules. Come on Cameron, who's right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me see.  If it's not Erdheim-Chester...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's exactly what we said before, garden variety viral gastroenteritis, can we go back to the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do a kidney biopsy. Esther's shut down in exactly-- </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This kid is not Esther. You screwed up, she died, I'm sorry but that does not mean this kid is dying as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What'd the test say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Colonoscopy was clean. And the biopsy was negative for Erdheim-Chester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>So Ian’s going to be all right? It was just some sort of virus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>But it's brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ian’s kidneys are shutting down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Still think it's not the same case?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll go and do a biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>E. coli H0157 causes bloody diarrhea, and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Toxins from the bacteria causes his kidneys to shut down, we should start him on plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Goodpasture's syndrome. Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not the purple papules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you throw in Esther's next symptom - brain, makes me think heavy metal toxicity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His hematocrit would have to be low, it's at 44 and Esther's never dropped below...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>42.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have the file memorised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's my lucky number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What about lymphoma? Causes kidney failure, GI bleed and can infiltrate the base of the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You check Esther for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She never showed any signs of... if he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain. Chase, run a blood smear and immuno-chemistries. Foreman get an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'll page Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No you won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't handle people disagreeing with you? She might have a different take on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Keep your answers short and discrete. Is Cuddy still playing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The chicken is still in Picadilly Square.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Brilliant. She'll never suspect that Normandy is her target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is that House? Tell him that the blinds just went to 20-40 and he's running out of chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How's she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well what's going on? The way you took off, something's obviously--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Love to chat but got a game to play. How's she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The patient is on life support, we're about to pull the plug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you talking about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And what have you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm... does sound like high dose cardio meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Two hearts. You got the flush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Still waiting on the final labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She drinking her seltzer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, hydration is not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Means she's bluffing. Push her all in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Call.  Two pair. Show me your hearts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Seven of clubs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh dear, sounds like I messed up. You're going to be stuck with her for a while. Talk to you soon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ohoho! Yes! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Why are you taking a picture of his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're looking for lymphoma but--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Wait, so it's not Erdheim something and it's not his kidneys but his kidneys are failing? Where's Dr Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>Erm Dr House mentioned another case, is there another patient with the same thing that Ian has?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr House had a patient a while back who exhibited the same symptoms as your son--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Then you know what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So what do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We know the likely course the disease will take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Alan</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She had multiple system failures--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What happened to her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I know it's scary, Ian, but you can do it. You're getting to be so grown up. So just hold perfectly still, just for a little bit.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fact that we know is an advantage.  Which means we can get ahead of it. Next station is the liver. We've got about 90 minutes before it gets there. Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Three tests, seven choices. Okay, what's first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-37"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sarcoidosis seems most likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-39"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's moving too fast to be spreading. It has to be growing from something that's already--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-40"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Genetic disorder - tuberous sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-41"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or it's his immune system, histiocytosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wing or drumstick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Going to need a little more than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A little more is more than a third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we have to repeat this test because you didn't cut us enough...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Adding one micro litre of the immunoperoxidase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Make it two. I don't want House biting off our heads because we weren't sure if it turned red or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> That's definitely not red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The problem could still be an abnormal cell growth but a different cell line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sarcoma? Muscle cells throughout his body? Would explain the geography.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Genetic disorder's far more likely in a 6-yr-old. Tuberous sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pretty unlikely to cause a GI bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Time course fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mr Foreman, you agree with both of them? Thanks for playing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we have enough tissue for two tests, why not do both?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sarcoma is more likely to hit a 6 and 70 yr old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tuberous sclerosis it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think sarcoma's less likely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nestin's negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh that's ok, if the tumor cells haven't matured, the KR67 protein wouldn't have turned off. What happens if we don't solve this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kid dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I mean for the next 12 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>KR67's negative. And PCH antigen is negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mighty Casey struck out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks a lot, didn't read that this weekend. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chondrocytoma. Connective tissue has been in all the places that we've been looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The kid is too sick for that, we're better off testing for sarcoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We would have seen signs of that when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The tumor cells looked like muscle under the microscope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, they didn't. They looked like fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I vote for neurofibromatosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because the other choices suck worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me a minute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You come up with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can talk about it tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I erm... I won the poker tournament.  I totally played this guy Burman from Business Affairs. I got great cards, but I don't bet. Just call, no raises. Burman pairs his king on the flop, I keep calling, the river turns, I check. He can't stand it. He goes all in, he's sure he's won.  I call. I flip 'em. Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pocket aces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I nailed his ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The aces were hiding all along.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Erdheim-Chester? That's not even on the list!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because we already did it. He tested negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So did Esther.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Disease lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want it to be there. Because then you didn't screw up 12 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run the test. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wait, let me think about that. Don't pressure me. Just run the damn test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cells look like macrophages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a good start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Take your time and say it loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>CD 68 positive </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start the treatment. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So Esther can rest peaceful now huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Forty.  You got lucky. You going to call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What I do, is not just based on the flip of a card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You guessed. You got lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, not just as easily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible. Are you going to call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know, relative to it's size, the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal. </content></utterance>
