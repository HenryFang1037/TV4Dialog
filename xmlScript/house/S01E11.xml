<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Pharmacist</speaker><content> Okay, yes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Pharmacist</speaker><content> All right, thank you.  Okay, pharmaceuticals were delivered this morning, but shipping accidentally sent the box with Vicodin to research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm. That’s a tough one. If only we had some way to communicate with another part of the building. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>16-year-old MVA victim. He’s been in and out of the hospital for three weeks with internal bleeding, no one can find the cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Internal bleeding after a car accident, wow, that’s shocking!  Let me talk to shipping, I speak their language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s been three weeks –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your hospital doesn’t have my pain medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Pharmacist</speaker><content>Shipping says it’s going to be an hour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is Dr. Cuddy, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The crash didn’t cause the bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, the bleed caused the crash. Blood got on the road, it got all slippery.  Anyone here got drugs? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She saw his blood, she got distracted, and she crashed his dad’s Porsche.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He must have inherited it. He’s gonna die. My condolences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It wasn’t inherited. The problem’s outside the red blood cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is impossible. A 16-year-old doesn’t get hemolytic anemia –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give her back the file; you have bigger problems to tend to, like my meds.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid’s gonna be dead in a matter of days if we don’t figure out why his red blood cells are disintegrating, so differential diagnosis, people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, it’s not environmental. Dad hired a company to clean the house, maid washed all the clothes, and bought hypoallergenic sheets and pillows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want us to recheck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. If it’s environmental he’ll get better just from staying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It could be an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No fever, no white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, he’s 99.2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Barely above normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But above. His body’s reacting to something. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We could account for the lack of fever and white count if it’s lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Drugs’ll fit just as much as lupus. Meth’ll cause hemolytic anemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A lot of meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He also doesn’t seem the type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because his dad drives a Porsche? Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Didn’t mean to offend you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, so it’s infection, lupus, drugs, or cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not? Great meeting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Shouldn’t we narrow it down before we finish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My leg gave us ‘till 11:15. I’ll talk to Wilson about lymphoma,  ANA for lupus,  radioimmunoassay for drugs,  and you… you test for whatever you thought it was.  I’ve got a date with a pharmacist.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, come on, come on, come on… [As soon as House gets the bottle, he dry-swallows a couple pills. Cuddy catches up to him on his way out the clinic doors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You know, there are other ways to manage pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like what, laughter? Meditation? Got a guy who can fix my third chakra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re addicted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the pills ran my life I’d agree with you, but it’s my leg busy calendaring what I can’t do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re in denial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, I never had an infarction in my leg, no dead muscle, no nerve damage. Doesn’t even hurt.  Actually, it kind of tickles. The chicks dig this.  Better than a puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s not just your leg. You wanna get high! You’re doing what, 80 mg a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, that’s way too much! Moderation is the key. Unless there’s pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s double what you were taking when I hired you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Cause you’re twice as annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can’t always be here to protect you. Patients talk. Doctors talk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About how big your ass has gotten lately? Not me, I defend it. You got back. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to go a week without the drugs, it’ll hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you can’t. If you’re just getting off pain medication, it will hurt, you won’t be having a great time, but you’ll make it. If you’re detoxing you’ll have chills, nausea… your pain will magnify five, ten times. You won’t make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I guess we’ll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’ll give you a week off clinic duty if you can go a week off narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No way! I love the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You love the pills. Two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pills don’t make me high. They make me neutral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A month. </content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Drugs could cause this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cocaine and meth are very hard on the blood system. Has he had any erratic behavior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>No, but…  She was in rehab in the 9th grade. She’s supposedly clean now, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She obviously cares for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Yeah, what she cared about was the car. Anniversary present from my wife. We drove it up north to watch the leaves change. She was dead a year later. Cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Mr. Foster, we’re going to test Keith for drugs.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> His hair will tell us any drugs he’s taken in the past sixty days. It’s kind of like rings on a tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Have you been sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>No, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Have you been out of the country?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>We went to China, but we got all of our shots before we left.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> It could be an infection. We’re going to give him a gallium scan just to be safe. We inject a radioactive isotope into his bloodstream, and we check to see if there’s inflammation anywhere in the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Has he ever complained of any joint pain? Sensitivity to light, rashes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>No, no, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Any relatives ever been diagnosed with lupus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I don’t even know that that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>In simple terms, the body becomes allergic to itself. The immune system attacks healthy cells in the circulatory system and destroys them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Would it be treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It can be manageable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> We can test for the antibodies. 95% of patients with lupus test positive for ANA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not cloudy. Negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What about bruising? He ever complain about tenderness under his arms or his groin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I’m not sure he’d tell me if he did. I guess I really don’t know what’s going on in his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s a teenager.  What type of cancer did your wife have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Pancreatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s his lymph nodes we’re concerned about. We’re going to do a biopsy to check for lymphoma.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>I have cancer, don’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’re just testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>That’s what they told my mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Negative for drugs. ANA was negative, gallium scan was clear…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I got that from the “nothing”. Where’s his hematocrit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Drops any lower he’s not going to have any red blood cells to bring oxygen to his body.  He’ll suffocate with his lungs working perfectly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>Excuse me, someone? Help, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Polite for a dying kid. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content> This one. What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s all right. Just, look down for me?  It’s clear. There’s nothing in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>It’s getting worse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is it fuzzy, or –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Keith</speaker><content>No! It’s dark! I can’t see!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s a retinal clot in the left eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Coumadin would dissolve the clot, fix his eyesight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can’t use bloodthinners, he’s got internal bleeding. Fix the eye, you kill everything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Surgery’s out for the same reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We have two hours to figure this out. Either we restore the blood flow or he loses the eye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget the eye. Tell him to use the other one to look on the bright side. The clot tells us something. It could help us figure out what he has, which could mean he gets to live.  Differential diagnosis, people. How does internal bleeding suddenly start clotting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It makes no sense, they’re opposing processes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It can happen in lupus. Increased platelet count can cause blood clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>ANA was negative. It’s not lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is true. But why are you the one saying it? What are you doing here? I thought we ruled out cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, go see Cuddy. She needs a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That’s funny, she said you might need one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s why you’re here? She wants you to keep an eye on me, make sure I don’t cheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I want to make sure you don’t start firing shots from the clock tower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> He hasn’t had Vicodin in over a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Does your leg hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ever been shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s gonna be side effects. Insomnia, depression, tachycardia –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Withdrawal symptoms. Not applicable. The only side-effects I’m going to have are some pain and thirty days of freedom.  Am I the only one who’s concerned about a dying kid? If it’s not lupus, what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Most likely candidate for throwing a clot is infection or cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Checked the biopsy twice, it’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not an infection. Gallium scan didn’t reveal anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, what hides from a gallium scan? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cardiac.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right. Clot slips off, travels through the artery, and gets backed up in the eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I wasn’t paying attention. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s an infection. In his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. Echocardiogram for the heart and IV antibiotics for the infection, stat. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is it my birthday?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because she’s beautiful I should do it? What kind of pathetic logic is that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The blood clot isn’t life-threatening. We’re focusing on figuring out the cause of your problems.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And the antibiotics aren’t doing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, double the dosage. 70mg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’ll box his kidneys for sure!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Well, then all the other tests could be wrong, too. This could still be an infection or cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Well, what, just hepatitis does? I know, I know, I know, you can never be sure. When Linda was in the hospital, the doctor told us there was this aggressive experimental treatment which might extend her life by two or three years. We figured if there was any hope at all that we could have her with us a little while longer, it would be worth it. 3 weeks later, she was gone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar. This kid doesn’t have lupoid hepatitis. He has acute naphthalene toxicity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>Naphthalene. You’re talking about mothballs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.  Termites. They create naphthalene to protect their nests, which I’m assuming is rather large and is inside all four walls of his bedroom at home. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>And your assumption is based on what?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You said it! If Keith’s symptoms had an environmental cause, they would have disappeared as soon as he got here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the food here wasn’t one step below Riker’s Island he would’ve gotten better. He’s lost fourteen pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas. The kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells. Outside the hospital his body burned protein and carbs for energy, and the naphthalene stayed in fat. But once the car accident put him in the hospital, and he started losing weight , his body had to get its energy somewhere else. It started to burn fat. The floodgates opened, the poison poured into his system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So, getting away from the poison is what poisoned him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Getting him away from his dad’s meatloaf is what’s killing him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You wanna explain to me why you stopped the surgery?  N – Oh, my God! My God. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I want him locked up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hey! Take it easy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your cat did not die of old age. He died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure caused by naphthalene poisoning, the exact same thing your son has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>You lie to me, you mess up my son’s surgery, and now you expect me to trust you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me twenty-four hours, we’ll pump your son full of calories –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That liver is going to somebody right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>We’re doing that surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If you do the surgery, you’ll be killing a mother of four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Father of three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was guessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Like you are now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what’s wrong with your son. It explains the internal bleeding, the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure… it also predicts what’ll happen next. If you do the surgery he’s gonna lay on that table for fourteen hours while his body continues to burn fat and release poison into his system. Either way, I did you a favor. He’s awake now, you’ve got a chance to say goodbye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think you should trust Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Give the liver to the other guy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You just said…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want any relationships.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, of, of course I have. I’ve, I’ve gotten older. My hair’s gotten thinner. Sometimes I’m bored, sometimes I’m lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I was there! You are not just a regular guy who’s getting older, you’ve changed! You’re miserable, and you’re afraid to face yourself –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Of course I’ve changed! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And everything’s the leg? Nothing’s the pills? They haven’t done a thing to you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, admitting you have a problem is the first –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>-- and he says it’s not a problem. Maybe it’s not. What do I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Nothing. I’ve done enough damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Better hope he never finds out that that was your idea.</content></utterance>
