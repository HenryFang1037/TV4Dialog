<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>How can a baby have male and female DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>It’s a condition called Genetic Mosaicism. The ambiguous genitalia can be surgically repaired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Repaired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Made to look more typical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>More typical? But you haven’t even told us if the baby is a boy or a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>That’s — that’s a choice you have to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content> Good job Jackson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content> Take it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content> He had the shot. He lost his nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Honey it's OK, he’s doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Black heels or the boots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know I’m a fan of those heels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Boots it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>For all we know, House knows you’re a fan of those heels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Like House is going to find out we faked our breakup because of your shoes?  Go with the boots.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You gonna eat that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Have at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did you just ask my permission before you took my food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Adolescent genetic mosaic collapsed during a basketball game, presenting with persistent pelvic pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The parents haven’t told their son that he could have been their daughter. They want assurance that you won’t either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Less fun, but still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That was easy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Our new patient, part girl, part boy, all Thirteen’s dream date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Severe pelvic pain started during a basketball game, could be dehydration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>ER gave him fluids when he came in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still, it feels chronic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We got a kid who could mate with himself and we think he didn’t have enough to drink? There are dozens of intersex disorders, persistent pelvic pain could mean Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, PMDS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Those conditions occur in intersex kids who are chromosomally XX or XY, not XX and XY. Parents recently started him on testosterone, maybe there’s something —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Vitamins wouldn’t cause pelvic pain.  There’s a note in here, we’re supposed to refer to his testosterone shots as vitamins. His parents aren’t just liars, they want us to be liars too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I won’t do it.  You guys will though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He’s a kid. Parents don’t think he’s ready to deal with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>My dad was the same way about me maybe having Huntingtons, it's —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well that was your experience. Must surely apply in this situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Pain could be caused by a blind uterus hidden in his abdomen. He needs an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right, boy with girl genes; I’m sure you’re the first doctor brilliant enough to check for a uterus. He could have complications from the surgeries on his penis, that can cause pelvic pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way to multitask, impress your boss and humiliate your ex. MRI’s a waste of time. To continue the humiliation, go put a camera up his penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>You're Dr. House, aren’t you? What do you think is wrong with our son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> These people were just coming to tell you. This is better, don’t have to worry about them losing their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>We think that he has a blind uterus, he should have an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Did you send them a text?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Over the past thirteen years, we’ve educated ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, who needs med school when you’ve got Wi-Fi?  Go schedule their son for an MRI with contrast right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You just said an MRI was a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So’s arguing with them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Contrast in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Jackson, we’re going to get started so try to lie still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> How long do you think the post-breakup awkwardness is going to last?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Foreman and I are both professionals.  Stomach and liver are clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If by professional you mean he’s a T1000 built by Cyberdine Systems? I never understood what you saw in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He’s not really your type huh?  Moving down for the pelvic floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Here’s my impression of Foreman on the happiest day of his life.  Now the saddest day of his life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We just broke up. I’m not quite ready to mock him yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House was a jerk to split you two up, but, bottom line, he did you a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Area around the intestinal tract is clear. No blind uterus. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I think, there’s something wrong with House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Who’s he making miserable now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Actually, no one. He OK’d an MRI just because the parents wanted to look for a blind uterus. There was no fighting, no arguing, he just went along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s a valid medical theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He doesn’t think it is. House decided to humor these parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe he had a great cup of coffee, or a tremendous bowel movement. Bottom line is your boss is in a good mood, stop analyzing it and just enjoy it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We’re going to use this scope to fill your bladder with saline, then examine your urethra for any narrow spots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>Why would there be a narrow spot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sometimes it just happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>Can my parents come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I thought it would be awkward for you, having them here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>I have this feeling they’ve seen me naked before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Now take a breath, just try to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>Mom. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>It's okay honey. It's okay. Hey, remember those sprints they made you run in practice? Those were so hard, but you pulled through. You can do this too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Up to the bladder, start the saline.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I’m going to look around and pull back on the scope. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content> It feels tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That pressure’s normal, just try to hold on for a few more minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content> Its not down there, its my chest .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content> Can’t breath, can’t, can’t breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Muffled heart sounds. Jugular’s distended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pericardial effusion we need ten gauge and a syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His heart is filling with exudate, if we don’t drain it, it will stop beating. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We drained the fluid from his pericardial space; his heart rate is back to normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pelvis, plus heart, doesn’t fit with any of the syndromes associated with mosaicism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be drugs, toxins, an infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> You’re okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That we’re considering a diagnosis unrelated to this kid being a shemale. Assuming a coincidence like that would usually torture you, but you’re completely unfazed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Completely unfazed? You think I’m totally lacking in any fazing? The idea that I’m anything less than half-fazed, I actually find offensive. It greatly fazes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He started testosterone —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vitamins</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> A few months ago. That can cause autoimmune diseases like Polyarteritis and SLE, which can cause pericardial effusion and pelvic pain. So it is related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now I’m unfazed. Start him on corticosteroids for the autoimmune and Finasteride to block the vitamins.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You slept with House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He asked permission before taking my bagel, took the case without a fight, honored the parents’ request for an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, those were my terms for sleeping with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s in a good mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sex with me would explain that, but it doesn’t explain why I’m not curled up in a ball weeping in shame.  I did not have sex with House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you two aren’t keeping something from me that means he’s keeping something from both of us. That can’t be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or he’s just in a good mood, this is not a crisis. Maybe you can get back some of that money he owes you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Testosterone blocker? Does that mean if Jackson has SLE or whatever that other thing was that he’d have to go off the hormones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Then Jackson will stop developing, he’ll never go through puberty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Maybe this isn’t what’s wrong with him. Maybe the testosterone didn’t cause it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Yeh, but if it is, then he’ll never be a man. Did we make the wrong choice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>You’ll need to tell him the testosterone blocker is something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or maybe this is a good opportunity to tell him the truth. It might make it simpler, for all of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>You want us to tell a sick adolescent boy that he’s really not an adolescent boy. That doesn’t seem simpler to me. No, just,  give him the meds.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, you have pain in one arm and both your legs. Does it hurt right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>No, its, when, I like put pressure on them. See, it hurts when I do this,  Ow, and this,  Ow, and this,  Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> How about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content>Owwwwwwwwwwwwww!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you give House the moron with the broken finger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Nurse Helen</speaker><content>They’ve been in room two about ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The patient should have been screaming for another doctor seven minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Ian</speaker><content> Thanks brah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>If I have this IV, why do I need a shot too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Just some extra medicine, just to be safe. I hear you’re quite the basketball player, what position?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>Point guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Small forward. How’s your crossover dribble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’m not really that into basketball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You’re going to feel a little pinch, okay. So, if you’re not that into it, why’d you join the team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>My Mom kinda made me do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>My parents were the same way, always pushing me to try new things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>It was more like what she didn’t want me to try.  I wanted to take dance, but she flipped out and made me choose between basketball and hockey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What does your Dad say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>He seemed okay with it, then he just caved in to my Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Your palm is red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>What’s that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That we still don’t know what’s wrong with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You were right; he is in a good mood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Bummer it didn’t work out with you and Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You guys seemed happy together. It’s probably for the best, you know, the bisexual thing and all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was never an issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No, it never is, until it is. This is Thirteen. Before you guys got together she was hooking up with a different girl every night. Long term you really think you could compete with that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, we have to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Stop pretending to be asleep, we’re not leaving. House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House,  House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s not breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Can you get a pulse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Barely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Call a code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Get an ambu bag from the nurses station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heart’s still working that means synapsis is still firing, we just need to get a message through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aaahh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You stopped breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What the hell is going on? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think my penis stopped breathing; do you know CPR?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Looks like your brain is Okay. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple.  No wonder you broke up with him. I’m surprised yours are still attached.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> By the way, I can see that from here. I assume those are our patient’s lab results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Patient can wait; you could have died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The only reason you’d ignore a near death experience is you don’t care or you already know why it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's called Vicodin, I took too many.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Can I please get some information about our patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Patient’s palms are red; lab tests confirm liver and kidney dysfunction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I don’t remember you taking any Vicodin today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t remember hiring my Mother. What causes the enzymes in little Boy George’s existing heart problem and pelvic pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn’t take any yesterday at breakfast either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t remember having breakfast with my Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Amyloidosis with systemic involvement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Protein levels are normal. This kid’s depressed, if he’s self-medicating with drugs and alcohol that would explain his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Search the school; search the home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Seriously, or are you just deflecting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Both. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Nowhere, I’m staying right here, so we can properly discuss this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> He’s on Heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How can you? —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Number one, he’s happy, which means he’s high. Number two, when he moved his bad leg he didn’t use his hands to support it. Whatever he’s taking, it’s stronger than Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You really think House took too many Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The guy pops’em like candy, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened before. You miss sleeping with women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Simple question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes. It’s a simple answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’ll check under the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I also miss sleeping with other men and I’m sure you miss sleeping with other women. Monogamy is like saying your never going to have any other ice cream flavor besides rocky road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So, your saying, if you don’t have pink bubble gum for a while that one day you’re going to chase down the ice cream truck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. Rocky Road is great. It’s a very delicious and complicated flavor. I also know that if I have other flavors, then rocky road is going to be left in the freezer where anyone can just, dip in. Can we please drop the metaphor? . Why is this coming up now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kutner said the silver lining of our breakup was, I wouldn’t be dumped for a girl.  There’s nothing in here either, seems like we’re wrong about this kid having drug or alcohol —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When did he bring that up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Earlier today, right before —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This morning Taub called you a robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Huh! Either it’s a big coincidence or, their jerking us around. They know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And if they know, House knows. This is bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, this is good. House only has two ways to handle us going out, he jerks us around or he fires us. He chose option A; this is good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You know, recreating the moment when you made us crap our pants isn’t actually all that funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> That is sweet that you’re worried about House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless the next stanza reads, “Hoping to fry my brain to death, I smoked some primo crystal meth,” I’m not interested.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content> He’s not ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>If telling him the truth would help him stop feeling like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>If I knew that it would make him less confused I’d tell him right now, but if she’s wrong we’d only make things worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He obviously senses he’s different. He’s looking for answers.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Noticed you smell like Thirteen’s soap every morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You figured it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yes, I’m a little slow; maybe someone should let me know when I should be insuIted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then House doesn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He probably does now that you felt her up during that last differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You noticed this, but House didn’t?</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House is on Heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Well, that’s certainly, an interesting notion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s why his lungs stopped, its why he OK’d the MRI, its why he missed things he wouldn’t ordinarily miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh, we’ll runs some tests, and I’ll let you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s there isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well that would certainly explain the inappropriate responses. I gotta go. Okay.  sorry, consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> When did you order these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>When you were in the bathroom. I thought a celebration was in order. To cheating death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You off bourbon? We can get you something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I came here expecting a burger. Figured I’d have to endure a little lecture on moderation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You never listen. So why —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Instead, I get a drink; a nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stop working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You seem fine now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t believe that I OD’d on Vicodin. You figure I’m on something stronger, and because you can never, ever assume anything but the most screwed up scenario as far as I’m concerned —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Funny how I’m usually right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think that I’m on Heroin. This is your version of a tox screen. Because if I am on Heroin; I can’t drink that without risking another bout of not breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Goodnight. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not on heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I just caught you with your fingers down your throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm on methadone. Stupid product. Heroin without the high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, and twice the risk of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But no risk of arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You nearly died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Today was a fluke. I nodded off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right, you're safe as long as you never sleep again. Mistime your dose, you die. Couple of drinks, you die. Mix it with the wrong drugs, you die. You want to detox from Vicodin? Pick something that won't kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not detoxing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you're looking for something to help with your pain —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry for the position Dr. Hadley put you in, but I can't do that. She's a valuable part of Dr. House's diagnostic team. If he stays on the case, so does she.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>We have to deal with Jackson. These questions aren't gonna go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>He's not ready for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Let's hope you're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I'm sorry. I'll stay away from their son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No — you won't. In about 15 minutes, you're the only person that kid's gonna trust. If he needs a hand to hold, make sure yours is available. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>No, no, buddy. You're just a little different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>You've known this...since I was born, and you never told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>We didn't want you to be confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>So you lied to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Oh, please, sweetie, we were just trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>Don't. Just leave me alone. Get out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know about the methadone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's legal. I have a prescription.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You keep taking this, you could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can't sit by and watch you kill yourself. As long as you're in my hospital, you can't do methadone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll send someone for my stuff. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's it, you're quitting? You're choosing methadone over this job?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>No, I don't.  I have this one friend — on my basketball team, Will. We hang out a lot. I really like him. Now I'm worried that I...you know, “like” him.  Maybe I'm supposed to. Because if I'm really a girl.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>I like dancing more than basketball. Is that what that means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Jackson. As hard — as it is right now, at least it's out in the open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content> This was an English assignment. We were supposed to write a poem in the style of Sylvia Plath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't feel this way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>I'm sad sometimes; I don't wanna die. At least, I didn't.  Are these antibiotics supposed to make you nauseous?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She didn't say. She just told me I was in charge until further notice. So if we add bloody vomit to our patient's list of symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Surgeon reports the bleeding was caused by a gastric fistula caused by Necrotizing Pancreatitis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing that would help us with this patient.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can. I have. He's not answering. Put the patient on proton pump inhibitors. If he gets better, it's Zollinger-Ellison; If not, it's scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Zollinger-Ellison doesn't fit better. You don't want it to be scleroderma because that means he's gonna die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>So, that means he's got the other thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm so sorry. We'll start him on anti-inflammatories. If we're lucky, that will slow down the progression.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah. Just tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Got some good news. Patient's scleroderma is responding to the anti-inflammatory meds. His AST level's dropped a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So he's dying slightly less quickly than we thought. That's great news.  I'm not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Next time just say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What's his AST?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uh... 185, I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's a pretty fast drop. Are we sure it's from the anti-inflammatories?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What else could it be from? He's been off the antibiotics for a while. Proton pump inhibitor's wouldn’t —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's back on testosterone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Testosterone wouldn't help his liver function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But it could improve his kidney function, which would also lower his AST.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But not in kidneys damaged by scleroderma.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And a bigger office... but in the same spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. We both know this is where you belong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Welcome back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're welcome. </content></utterance>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have issues with authority. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We thought you were gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy missed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And what happened to your cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She asked to borrow it for some reason. Patient dead or do I need to do anything? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's got scleroderma. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's not scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Two days, and you've already got two separate theories. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're back. Good. We noticed a drop in AST levels. It's not from the anti-inflammatory meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's because his kidneys got better from the testosterone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which rules out scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When did you two come up with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We ran into each other in the lobby. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what did we miss? When I say "we" I mean "you," since I wasn't here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We've ruled out Zollinger-Ellison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was a dumb idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Also toxoplasmosis, dehydration, SLE, various intersex disorders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, crap.  This kid like energy drinks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I saw some empty bottles in the team locker room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But energy drinks don't explain —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So, we're okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why wouldn't we be?  Nice heels. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is all your parents' fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your son came in here with simple dehydration. That's why he collapsed during the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>The ER treated him for that. It didn't help the pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's where the energy drinks came in. They put a strain on his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Then why isn't he better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's where your idiocy came in. Before we could give him another glass of water, you two insisted I do an MRI. So, I go down a blind alley looking for a blind uterus. And my team injects him with contrast material. If his kidneys had been healthy, they would've filtered out the contrast in a couple hours. Since they weren't, it went around and around, eventually getting absorbed by his heart, his liver, and his pancreas; getting in trouble everywhere it went. Your son was fine when he got here. It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Nearly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You gave birth to a freak of nature.  Doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one. </content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>A little bit better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I saw you talking to your parents earlier. That's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>My mom asked if I wanted to take dance lessons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Jackson</speaker><content>I'm actually worried I might miss basketball. Starting to get good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No reason you can't do both. </content></utterance>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Starting tomorrow, you'll come to my office for your fix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm done with the methadone. I screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The kid’s parents wanted that MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway. That's what got him sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You just solved a case that no one else could solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I created a case. I played nice because, I was in a good mood because, I didn't hurt. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don't need your pain to be a good doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm not interested in good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're afraid to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why do you care if I'm happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're afraid of change. The one thing you have is your intellect. You think if that's compromised, you have nothing.  Just take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's already done.  This is the only me you get.</content></utterance>
