<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Follow my finger.  Adam, show me a bicycle.  Eyes here. Adam? Show me a bicycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content> No buddy, that's a ball.  Adam look at me, are you hungry? Show me what you want for lunch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Still drawing those lines instead of looking at the cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>More juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>He wants more juice he has to ask for it. Adam? Buddy? Eyes here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>He's tired Dom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Wouldn't be if we stuck to the schedule. Show me the juice, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Think we've reached the point of diminished returns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content> He has to ask for it. Adam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>He's choking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>That's impossible, it's mac and cheese.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's autistic, severely autistic. Can't talk, can't make eye contact. Screaming's probably his way of communicating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wow, so clearly that can't be the answer. His brain can't filter information, it's a constant assault on his senses I'd scream too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia. Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Since when do we start believing parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Elevator.  Dad was on Wall Street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm, when their son was diagnosed with autism they both quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So they're overprotective and scared, that's all the more reason to--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ER checked his throat, no obstructions, nothing! Which means the only symptom was a scream, which is diagnostic of nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Kid clutched his chest, BP was elevated; maybe there was chest pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ER said the heart was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Down. Stool sample to check for parasites, blood culture to rule out infection and ANA for lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because he screamed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could also be an environmental reaction; an allergy, dust, wheat, pollen, a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check the house. Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I had a date last night, she screamed. Should we spend a 100,000 dollars testing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing!  Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not what I'm saying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want my old carpet back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Err; we're going to have to do this later. A kid in the clinic had an accident.  Generally when people are on the phone--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want my old carpet back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It was stained, with blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You think you can get me to do anything you want regardless of how stupid it is?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's identical to the old carpet, except without the hazardous biological waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I shall not return to my office until every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Inspiring.  If you don't want to work in your office, work in the clinic. You don't want to work in the clinic, go home and don't get paid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica!  Attica?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>He just needs to finish this level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We only have the scanner for the next half hour, after that--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Trust me; you don't want to move him until he's finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The sooner we do this test, the sooner we can get you guys home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content> Adam? Do you think that--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>10 minutes tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If he has a vascular disorder, we might not have--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>He might not have 10 minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't have 10 minutes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>No! You don't want to do that!  Adam! Adam! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Patient 1</speaker><content>I used Metamucil like the doctor told me and finally I was able to use the bathroom but I saw something in the toilet I couldn't identify.  I wrapped it in tissue paper so you could take a look. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Can't you sedate him or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could if I didn't want the test results to mean anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Patient 2</speaker><content>Painkillers, exercises, I even did that puncture thing, nothing works. Then this morning, I get up, my back feels great. I figured I'd better get down here right away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Big shocker, dad's depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Save your time, SSRIs don't cause chest pain.  Wow. Every minute of every day is booked. He eats, sleeps, plays his handheld.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not much of a life for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They chose to have a family; you don't get to decide what your kid's going to be like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nobody chooses this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's funny. You get a normal kid, a parent works. You get a special kid that costs more; you quit and turn the backyard into a therapy circuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yes, if only you were handicapped, all the good times you could have had with dad. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>Hey doctor House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hello girl whose name I don't remember but whose dad I treated so I don't really know why she's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>Ali. Umm... I think I caught what my dad has. The rhino thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right.  Does that hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>A little. It's in my chest too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course it is.  Kinda had access through the shirt, this'll work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>That feels good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-yr-old boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>About 5 weeks ago? It's been very lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The ventilation scan was normal, time to send him home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't leave right now.  Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A rhinovirus? You can't leave because she has a cold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All the tests are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Hey, don't start with me. We're backed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What'd she do to your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's unusable. So, whatever's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There were some pesticides and some alcohol but the tox screen was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Should we do this some place else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And since I can't work in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is this your master plan? Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie.  Fecal smear, talk to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put back my carpet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No! Get out of here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Parents have the smear the kit but the kid is constipated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do what you want, not replacing your carpet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Carpets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need a stool sample. We should probably wait until he's finished playing that level, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I actually think he's a bit better today. He seems more like his old self.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It is possible that he was never sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>I guess we err... could have overreacted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Adam? Adam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Adam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why are we in here? This is some sort of power play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion.  You ever considered getting a manicure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I took the stool sample after his lungs failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or do you really have a problem with the carpeting? Change sets you off--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If there's a pleural effusion, we have to rule out heart failure. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why now? Why a power play now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I smelled weakness. Get the kid an echocardiogram. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's funny; it says James Wilson, what a strange typo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fluid comes back in exudate; get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thank you for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You share stories, feelings... toys. You don't share offices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is so not Zen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It was a gift, some doctors get those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you want mornings or afternoons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You couldn't make Cuddy miserable so you're going to make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What makes you think I can make her miserable? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you're good at that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ohhh, I'm nothing compared to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is there anything you'll throw out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's a gift from an 11-yr-old patient of mine, she and I both knew it was a piece of junk and that's what made her laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you gotta keep it until she… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She already did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Adam, I need you to stay still buddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Okay, it's okay, I got him. Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>What? What is it? Is his heart ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Echo suggested a conduction abnormality, EKG confirmed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Still doesn't explain the effusion. Pleural fluid was in exudate, we should be looking for something that explains both the heart and lung problems. An infection, parasite, cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Microbiology showed no organisms in the fluid so forget infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's not a power play.  Doing a differential in the clinic makes sense - piss Cuddy off. Same thing with Wilson's office - works indirectly. But now we're in office space because you don't want to be in your own office which means this has nothing to do with Cuddy, you really are obsessed with your carpets. Which means--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What are you doing here? I have this room booked from 2 to 3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, 2 East coast time?  I thought you meant Pacific, which is stupid of me I guess.  What about parasites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stool sample's negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's 2 o' clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh well, we should go then.  That just leaves cancer. Get a lung biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, can we talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Carpet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huh. A lot to discuss, china patterns--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, she's a stalker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, couldn't be that she finds me interesting and attractive. Has to be that she's insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's called you 15 times; your mother's not that interested in you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm notifying security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is this about the carpet? Do you think I'll back off if you block all my fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You better not be having fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's dangerous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's not dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Men are stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm with you so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm notifying security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, give her a break, she's not dangerous, she's... insightful.  You can't stop our love! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We have a 10-yr-old with pleural effusion and conduction abnormality but no heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Was there a protein in the pleural fluid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, that's why we're thinking cancer, Non-Hodgkin's probably so we want to do a lung biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Lung biopsies usually come back negative so biopsy a lymph node under the arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's probably something an Oncologist should do, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's nothing real tricky to it, just a biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-46"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still, just to be safe, you mind? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here.  Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-48"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-49"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Somebody you'll never send a gift to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-50"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is doctor House, your son's doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-51"><speaker>House</speaker><content> High test please.  Hey, hey, hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-52"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Out of vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-53"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-54"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eating the red berries. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-55"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>He trusted you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-56"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that wasn't trust. That was self-preservation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-57"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>No, that was huge. It was like a conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-58"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them. Monkey see, monkey do, that's all it was. Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-59"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That was sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-60"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have pretty hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-61"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hope is all those parents have going for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-62"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, hope is what's making them miserable. What they should do is get a cocker spaniel. A dog would look them in the eye, wag his tail when he's happy, lick their face, show them love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-63"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal child? It's normal to want to be normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-64"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spoken like a true circle queen. See skinny socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle, and everyone inside the circle is normal, anyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized or worse, pitied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-65"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-66"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading? This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain or your excretions or your grandma's itchy place. Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties? I don't pity this kid, I envy him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-67"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Err, no cancer... because these aren't lymph cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-68"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then what are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-69"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Liver cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-70"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lymph system circulates fluid, not organ cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cancer cells break into the lymphatic system all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But we're not talking about cancer cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cancer cells are damaged lets them go into blood vessels, go wherever they want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So if the liver cells are damaged...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Liver isn't damaged. The tests were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, even the heart issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Liver cells are fine, he was immunized for Hep A and B and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral.  Just leaves a lot of boozerosis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver, there was no scarring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cirrhosis explains the symptoms; heart problems, lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Look up cirrhosis in the dictionary, it means scarring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They quit their jobs for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, they are everything you'd want in a parent. Unfortunately their kid is nothing you'd want. When a baby is born, it's perfect; little fingers, little toes, plump, perfect, pink, and brimming with unbridled potential. Then it's downhill, some hills steeper than others. Parents get off on their kid's accomplishments.  Cute! They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards. Hell they'll even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has.  But this kid, he doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh. His parents get nothing, the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a line-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't ask what you didn't find; I asked what you did find in the stool sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stool. And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate, can we leave?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis. Parents didn't poison their son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's constipated, parents probably just overdid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So he ate some chalk, it isn't toxic, sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget the chalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You just said it was about the chalk.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The frisky it went away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-42"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, this isn't a game.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-50"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Jimson weed doesn't explain the screaming.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-60"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>7.40 - 7.50 he goes to the toilet, washes his face, what does this matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-61"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-62"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His schedule has nothing to do with Jimson weed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-63"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-64"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stroke, bleed in the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And all the imaging just missed it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's a micro tumor. Started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion, then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. And then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I've a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look. So, unless you have a better idea, I'm going to go CT his head and then if I have to, remove his eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-56"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not love, you have spore in your brain; Coccidioides immitis. California's full of them, they get an earthquake they get released into the air, you breathe it in you get a cold, turns into sinus congestion, aches, weakness, milky tears and sometimes loss of inhibition and judgment. Damn! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-57"><speaker>Ali</speaker><content>So loving you, wanting to have sex with you is all just the spores talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-58"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You'll probably live. Damn!</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey! Don't touch his eye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>This is an appendectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like I said, don't touch his eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why isn't he in surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Some emergency bumped him; we've got another room in 10 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Better not take him in, kill the lights.  He's seeing them all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He's telling us what he's seeing, telling us exactly what was wrong with him, drawing them for us over and over again. Nobody knew how to speak autistic. When I asked him what he ate he even told me that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>What are you talking about? What was he seeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hello my pretties. It's not a tumor, Foreman, it's worms swimming in his eye. Animal makes potty in the sandbox, boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand, you can probably tell where this is going by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stool samples were negative for parasites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their human host.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron tested the sand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All of it? Worms spread from his gut to the rest of his body. Attacked his lungs, that’s what made him scream and caused the effusion.  Invade his liver sending dead liver cells coursing through his system, it attacked his eye and the muscles surrounding it making his eyeball do a back flip. Laser photo coagulation can fix the eye and high dose of benzimidazole should kill the worms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Wait a minute, that's it? He's going to be ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm going to read you something. "Asperger's syndrome is a mild and rare form of autism. It is typically characterized by difficulty establishing friendships and playing with peers, trouble accepting conventional social rules, and they dislike any change in setting or routine"... or broadloom. Doesn't say that last part but you get my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House doesn't have Asperger's, diagnosis is much simpler; he's a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why do you think he took this case? Because he believes these parents? Because he wants to help a young boy? He sees himself in this kid and he's trying to help himself. He doesn't want this, he needs it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're not autistic; you don't even have Asperger's. You wish you did, it would exempt you from the rules, give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility, let you date 17-yr-olds. But most important it would mean that you're not just a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk?  First tongue kiss, an 8 on the happiness scale.  Your child being snatched back from the brink of death, that's a 10. They're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5 because they know what they have to go back to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>Listen... thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>You saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah I know, see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>Dominic</speaker><content>You're so good! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That was a 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>All change is bad? It's not true you know.</content></utterance>
