<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Cross-species mating. I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Amber and I have a lot in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's a Cutthroat Bitch. You cry over Dark Victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Bette Davis - another strong, assertive woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You don't like strong, you don't like assertive. You like needy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's not dying, is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Yes. Go 'way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I give it two months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Hundred bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not really fair. You're not objective.  But I'm all about the teaching...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> We're at four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> You hid this from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I was wrong, okay? I thought you'd be upset. I thought you'd track me down in the hallways, and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You shouldn't have discounted the sex. She's obviously limber enough to put off the meltdown for two months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>She's not needy. I don't need needy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's scary. Why does Scary need Pathetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Are you gonna talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I don't see that I have any choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You all right with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No impulse to save her from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I've broken the pattern, House. Which is why this has a chance. I know you're too suspicious to accept that without getting out your ruler and your calipers and your scanning equipment. So, go ahead. Get it out of your system.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Thirty-eight-year-old female with loss of bladder control, blood in her urine and a broken leg from collapsing at her wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Ampicillin for the UTI.  Shiny cast for the leg.  You guys know Wilson's dating Amber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Wilson and Amber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I asked her out. Said she just started seeing someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Cultures were negative for UTIs. No signs of previous trauma or STDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Kidney cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>CT was clean for tumors and kidney stones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I thought Amber scared you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>She does. But she also has legs that go all the way up to Canada.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So do Canadians. Doesn't mean I wanna date one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Her sodium's low. Could be endometriosis in the bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Low sodium could also be from low food. Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Or... sodium was absorbed by a toxin already in her system.  Was it just the legs? Or did you detect something resembling a soul?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> She grew on me. If there's a toxin in her, could be carbolic acid.  I'm talking about the patient now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>That much carbolic acid, someone would've had to poison her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Coulda been a Cossack. If this was eighteenth-century Poland and Cossacks were into household cleansers. Which is why it's more likely that the poisoner was "poisonee".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Suicide's a sin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Corollary of "people lie" is "people sin". In my world, "people" includes Jews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>She was getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hasidic women marry young so they can start pushing out little Hasidilings. Thirty-eight means a woman not on anyone's hot-list. Being pushed onto a guy who's not on anyone's hot-list. No way out, no way out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Endometriosis fits better than an epiphany that her life is meaningless. We should start her on AIs and do a cystoscopy to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Check her innards for bad cells and her home for bad karma. Carbolic acid should be on her shelf, right next to the regret and the self-loathing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> These people are crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, she should be self-hating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>I'm not self-hating. I hate religious people who are out of touch with reality. You only marry someone you met three times, if they're carrying a little mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> What's their divorce rate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Cleaners are all organic, nothing with carbolic acid. You like how they hook up?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Values may give you the big picture, but time together gives you the little picture. Does she chew her food too loud? Will she leave you alone during the Final Four?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You commit to something deeper, you let the little surprises slide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Surprises kill. Which is why I only commit when there are no more surprises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>And you have no more surprises for your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Do you think this came up on date number two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You ever heard of a Hasidic Jew into hard rock? She's listed as a producer on all of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Where there's rock and roll,  and sex... usually, there's drugs.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content>I'm Baalat tshuva. I became Hasidic about six months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>And before six months ago? Music business isn't exactly known for its holiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content> Heroin. But I've been clean for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content>Yonatan knows. The broad strokes. He never actually asks the details. Says what's important is the person that I am now, not the person I was then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>How do you go all the way from...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content> Just took a class. Then I took another class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>And you just completely left the music business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content>Pop music is considered frivolous. Same reason we don't watch TV or go to movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Your drug use may have caused some long term damage. We're gonna need to take a hair sample to test for latent toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> So you can never watch Star Wars again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You figured that I'll hire you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>... if you promised to dump Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>How did you...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Wilson had a key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You figure that I'll make your life hell at first, but I'll eventually see how good you are and keep you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> It's a good plan, don't you think? Perfectly tailored to your personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, it's not. You know it's not. Means you just wanna stay in my orbit 'cause you figure I'll eventually realize that I made a mistake and you're gonna be able to rub my face in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> I can't wait. It's gonna be awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, it's not. And you know it's not. 'Cause you know that even if I made a mistake, I'd never admit that I made a mistake. Which means that you're just toying with Wilson to toy with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Your goal is pure feral vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Innocent bystander, but there's a greater good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, that's not it. Because a bag of flaming poop bypasses the bystander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>So... which is it, House? Am I in this for you? Or am I in this for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Give him back his sweatshirt. 'Pit stains don't become you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Treatment had no effect. Rules out endometriosis. And her hair sample was negative for residue drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>This woman lived in the fast lane till six months ago. Maybe we're missing something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>She admitted drug use. Doubt she's holding out on her days as an asbestos miner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Cryoglobulinemia might account for the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Except for the one you missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>There's no change in her condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm not talking about a new symptom. I'm talking about one that presented six months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Look, she's nuts, but we can't just give her ten ccs of atheism and send her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Religion is a symptom of irrational belief and groundless hope. Altered mental status, on the other hand, is a symptom of porphyria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>She didn't develop uncontrollable anger, crying, anxiety. She just decided to go to temple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The woman didn't _just_ choose to keep kosher.  She went directly to the extremes of Hasidism, a life of stringent rules. She became a masochist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>She didn't like her old life, so she changed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>People don't change. They might want to. They need to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> Taub gave up a six figure plastic surgery career for this job. That mean he has porphyria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>He switched jobs to save his marriage. He did it to avoid change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> He's right. You don't suddenly choose crazy without suddenly being crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>No, no, if she walked away from everything to go base jumping or live with apes, we wouldn't be having this discussion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>We would if she was also tinkling blood out of her overexcited bladder. Pump Hadassah full of hematin and give her a phlebotomy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content>Bloodletting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Porphyria is a rare genetic disorder that causes an overproduction of a certain protein. Draining the blood relieves...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>The hair test for damage from drugs showed she has a rare genetic disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Not-not exactly. We're testing her now to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>You're treating it before you confirm it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Blood test results take twenty-four hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>You must have seen something that makes you suspect it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Uhh, Dr. House has a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ROZ VINER</speaker><content>A theory based on what?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>We'd like a different doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I assure you that Dr. House is our best...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>Then we will settle for second-best, someone who doesn't think my wife is sick just because she's religious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If you prefer, I can give your wife my second-best diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>D'you know Wilson's dating Amber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I have reviewed the chart. Someone on your team must have pointed out that cryoglobulinemia also fits the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes, it fits _many_ of the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>My wife's body is sick. Her mind and soul are fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You live according to God's six hundred commandments, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content> Six hundred thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You understand them all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>Takes a lifetime of learning...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>But you follow the ones you don't understand because the ones you do understand make sense, and you believe that the guy who created them knows what he's doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So you will trust my diagnosis and you'll let me treat her, because in this temple,  I am Dr. Yahweh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content> I want a new doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I'm starting her on indomethacin for cryoglobulinemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>People don't change. For example, I'm gonna keep repeating "people don't change".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>So alcoholics that successfully go through treatment don't exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>They're still alcoholics. If they never take a drink as long as they live, it's only 'cause they didn't live long enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>If you're dissatisfied with your life, changing it is a symptom of mental health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I get why that concept is strange to you...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic. We might need to intubate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>YONATAN ARNOFF</speaker><content> What's wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>It's definitely not cryoglobulinemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Better ask Him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> We kept her on oxygen overnight.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Her respiratory rate stabilized, and her O-sat's back up to 95. Saw Amber drop off Wilson this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Yes. The male always drives the female. So what caused the breathing problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Pulmonary involvement rules out porphyria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>She kiss him or he kiss her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I missed it. The lab tech with the tongue stud also pulled up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Wegener's would explain her elevated sed rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Wegener's wouldn't explain the changed mental status.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Actually, we've been trying to ignore that part of the whiteboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, I wrote it in black. I'm always serious when I use black. Lupus would explain...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Maybe she didn't change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Are you agreeing with me or you making a point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I'm making a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>That's gonna take longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>How do we know that the real Roz isn't who she is now and who she was then? Can't we say that her previous life was true without making her present one a fraud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>"Life is messy" argument. Nice. Explains everything without explaining anything. If it's lupus, there's a heart problem we don't know about yet. Run her through a stress test. If she has a heart attack, I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Or we could wait. Hope that...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You're afraid to give her a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Of course we're afraid to...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No reason to be afraid. Unless you think I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> It's Wegener's.</content></utterance>
