<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm thinking the broken bones are a response to the building falling on her head. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Have you even interviewed anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You test drive a car before you buy it. You have sex before you get married. I can't hire a team based on a ten-minute interview. What if I don't like having sex with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing. Concert is over.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>He's not gonna solve the case. Not that fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Imagine that… the roof of the storage closet collapses on your favorite…  floor buffer. Which then starts overheating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>LEON THE JANITOR</speaker><content>Why would I have a favorite floor buffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LEON THE JANITOR</speaker><content>Okay.  Maybe the electrical works got banged up in there from stuff falling on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm, interesting. Brain damage leading to hypothalamic dysregulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nah. If you're brought in covered in rubble, it's all about the MRIs. We'd have seen that.  C'mon! Gotta earn that fiver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>LEON THE JANITOR</speaker><content> Or stuff leaked in the holes, messing it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Lacerations leave multiple portals for infection. Bacteria would've responded to the antibiotics. 'S too high for viral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Parasites or fungus is possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>LEON THE JANITOR</speaker><content>Or maybe lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>LEON THE JANITOR</speaker><content>My grandma has lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Okay, autoimmune. I'll run a lupus panel. Infection fits best. Complete history would be helpful. Which leads to the worst part of the job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The file says she was sick before the building collapsed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>I figured it was just a cold. Why, do you think it's related?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Her being sick and her being sick? Often is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>She was unconscious when I found her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content> We'd been fighting. I just wanna… Just tell me she's gonna be okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>EPA's doing that job for us. They say it's clean. Which means we're making a pilgrimage to Castle Blackberry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No need. I'm sure we can find a large rock somewhere.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What're you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>There's a sale on Liquid Tide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If you're broke, I can lend you a tiny bit of the money I owe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>No, no, I wouldn't put you in that position. What does the diary say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It's basically a list of her sexual encounters. Boys, girls, vibrating appliances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>If it was, you'd be quoting, not summarizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> This is a parade of sad banalities. "I can hardly get out of bed. Feeling blue." Then, three months ago, turns into a parade of happy banalities. "Starting to turn the corner. Job's looking up."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>We can stop swabbing. Her clichés are getting healthier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Or she's less depressed. Aren't there pills that do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Antidepressants don't cause fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not on their own. But the ER Didn't know she was on MAO Inhibitors, so they gave her demerol. 'S a nasty combo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>So all you have to do is convince this kid that his girlfriend had a secret doctor, and a secret stash, and a secret life. It's been a while since a patient took a swing at you. Can I watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I only have to convince the mother.  Actually… I don't have to convince anyone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>This it total crap. If she was seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know. If she was on drugs, I'd know.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>He's a janitor?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>House, shut up! I am… very sorry how Dr. House handled this. It is completely unforgivable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Except if he's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Dialysis will filter her blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content> There's nothing to filter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Save her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>She wasn't depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>"I'm miserable around Ben."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not me. I like Ben.  February 12th.  Either she's depressed, or she just thinks you're a jerk. Neither suggests that you should be the one directing her medical treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, but medically…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's probably hiding them in her purse.  I thought it'd be rude to go searching under a thousand tons of rubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>This was months ago. We were in a fight. Doesn't mean she's depressed and it doesn't mean she doesn't love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine, maybe the diary proves nothing. On the other hand, half the country's on antidepressants. And it fits her symptoms perfectly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> No ring on your daughter's finger means you make the decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You really wanna risk her life on how well _he_ knows her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>THE GUITARNAPPER</speaker><content> You must follow these instructions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Any attempt to contact the FBI or other law enforcement agencies, or… Cuddy, will be met with…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> …and a large Coke. No ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Give it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Did someone… kidnap your guitar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Your twelve-thousand-dollar 1967 Flying V? Or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Where'd you hide it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I am flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, it takes a cr…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It takes a criminal mastermind to pull off a heist from an unlocked, unguarded room down the hall. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Me? Nothing. But I'm sure the kidnapper wants what every kidnapper wants. To see you interview five to seven well-qualified fellowship candidates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I don't need a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You were bouncing ideas off a janitor.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. If you can hear what I'm saying, blink once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You can't talk right now. You have a tube down your throat. And try not to move your head. You've been in a terrible accident. But it looks like you will have no permanent injuries. You've had a bad fever, but it's gone now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>I've been here the whole time, honey, okay? I'm not leavin'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>This is very important. I need you to blink one for "yes", twice for "no". Were you seeing a psychiatrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Were you on MAO Inhibitors? The antidepressant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>Megan, it's okay. It doesn't matter, okay? I love you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>What's happening? Are we upsetting her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Heart is beating too fast.  Get the family out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Charging to two hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>Meg, Meg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Clear!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>We shocked her back into sinus rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Fascinating. Equally fascinating is… why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet.  But you lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I explained the fever. Which is all we were talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She confirmed the antidepressants. Go bet with someone else if you want to explain the heart problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>She confirmed them by winking. Maybe there was a cute guy across the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She got better when I treated her. Even I'm not that cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Two unrelated symptoms, just a coincidence. Or… you're grasping at straws to avoid admitting you can't do this on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Fine, what explains the fever and persistent tachycardia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>It could be anything. Endocarditis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope. Fever, no infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Um…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I don't believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm not gonna play this game. Just give me the damn résumés.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>And my guitar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> I don't have it. Although I did hear some plangent strumming from under that couch earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Wow. This kidnapper isn't just bold, he's diabolical. I guess he realized he probably shouldn't give it back to you until after you've had the interviews.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Huh! You didn't write anything. So what you're saying is, you didn't find that one big explanation… 'cause there isn't one. Clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Well, let's just say, your antidepressant theory does explain the fever. What about the heart? And don't say a building fell on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay…  A structure collapsed…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature releases potassium, causes V-Tach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You'd think she'd get Crush Syndrome after she was crushed, not two days later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Microvascular occlusions. Takes that long for the blood to reperfuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>She'd have a baggy heart.  Echo it to confirm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Does it sound good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>I mean, compared to the other things it could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>There are no other things it could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Excellent question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The heart's fine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Her first fever was from the medication for her depression.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Yes, she looks perfectly healthy. This much bleeding is a symptom of something more. And you need a team because you're wrong and you're gonna kill this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If I had a team, this patient would be dead. Because they'd be here instead of me and they wouldn't notice the size of this woman's uterus.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Enlarged uterus. Means that she was recently pregnant. She's a good liar, but I doubt she could hide a baby from her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Scraping in the uterus indicates that she had an abortion. But nothing in her medical history. Only one reason to hide an abortion. Boyfriend wants babies, she doesn't.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It's not the abortion, it's what she did after. The boyfriend would have noticed condoms. He would notice abstinence. He would not notice the pill. Which means,  I don't need a team!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If they'd known she was on it, they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner after her hip surgery. The combination caused the bleeding. It's good news. It's treatable. Just give her tamoxifen. Which is normally a breast cancer…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>It's not true. 'Cause, uh, we wanna have kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm, I already did the blood tests. Either she lied to you, or her blood lied to us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>IMELDA</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Didn't you get my memo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>IMELDA</speaker><content>Sure. Got both memos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> Both.  And the second memo said to ignore the first memo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>IMELDA</speaker><content>Yep. Seemed odd. Did an MRI and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> 'Course you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>What'd you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>IMELDA</speaker><content>It's kind of freaky. She's got growths all over the place.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>She's got tumors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Not exactly. The growths are eosinophilic granulomas.  They are usually from allergic reactions. I'm putting her on steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>We don't know. Unfortunately, the only drug she's had enough of to have this kind of reaction is cephalosporin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>Because she was on it two months ago. That's what you mean, right? She… took it for strep throat, so she can't be allergic to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>It would seem so.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Give him back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> It's a guitar! You took a human being!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Now who doesn't have a sense of humor? I'm monitoring the guy remotely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>What are you, listening for the distant sound of screaming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The nurses know to call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>They don't know who he is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>His name's right there on the chart. Now go away. I'm working.</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Megan? Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>Nothing? What-what-what's going on? What's wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Her? Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Just some amphetamines to wake her up. Everything could be explained by her lying to you. The antidepressants, the drinking, the pill. Until now. Now she's allergic to something the chart says she's not allergic to. That's not her lying, that's the chart lying. Which doesn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Do you know a Liz Masters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>Yeah, she worked with Megan. That was her boyfriend who you met outside the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm.  This is her chart.  She's on MAO Inhibitors for depression. She's on the pill. She had an abortion a month ago. And she's allergic to cephalosporin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content> What's going on here? What, are you saying this isn't Megan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>MEGAN BRADBERRY</speaker><content> Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content> Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>MEGAN BRADBERRY</speaker><content> Since right before I began pretending I loved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She's the same size as Megan, same build, same hair color.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>FLASHBACK</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>They were both horribly injured. Unrecognizably. EMT teams do not second guess family members' identifications at accident scenes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>BEN PROSNER</speaker><content>No. Liz died yesterday. This isn't Liz. I know Megan. I know her hair. I know her hands. I know her smell. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> What's your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>LIZ MASTERS</speaker><content> Liz…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Your girlfriend never lied to you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-27"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I did it all by myself, mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-28"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>How'd you know it was me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-29"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>There's a scent given off by wounded, feral cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-30"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> You were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-31"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I got everything right. Just treated the wrong…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-32"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> They had a good relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-33"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>He couldn't even identify her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-34"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>And you were wrong about needing a team. She almost died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-35"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So I almost need a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-36"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You were content with your "people are idiots" theory. But Cameron would never have accepted that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life. And as soon as you claimed it was multiple conditions, Foreman would have done anything to prove you wrong. And then, Chase would have done anything to prove you right. Any one of them would have solved this days ago. Hire a team. I don't care how you do it. Just do it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Sometimes, I am wrong. I have a gift for observation. For reading people in situations. But sometimes, I am wrong. This will be the longest job interview of your life. I will test you in ways that you will often consider unfair, demeaning and illegal. And you will often be right. Look to your left. Now look to your right. By the end of six weeks, one of you will be gone. As will twenty-eight more of you.  Wear a cup.</content></utterance>
