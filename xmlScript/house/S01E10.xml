<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bouncer</speaker><content>20 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Okay. No problem, I, ah, I just got it in here somewhere.  Oh god, I’m - I’m sorry, I guess I must have forgotten to go to the machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bouncer</speaker><content>Yeah, and ah, brush your teeth. Lady, you don’t have two cents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>I can - I can get it from - from my friend who’s inside, he can give it to me and then I can bring it back out here to you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bouncer</speaker><content>You don’t know anybody here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Yes I do! James, he’s blonde and he’s really friendly and he’s a big talker.  I need to see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bouncer</speaker><content> Go on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> James? James? James?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Tall Girl</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Do you know where James is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Tall Girl</speaker><content>Oh yeah, he’s, he’s around here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Tall Girl</speaker><content>Let’s go find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Tall Girl</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>I really need to find him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Tall Girl</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Short Girl</speaker><content>Bitch! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>NO! She’s trying to help me… get off her!  Get off me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Policeman 1</speaker><content>Settle down! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Policeman 2</speaker><content> Move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Policeman 1</speaker><content>Geez, I didn’t touch her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Policeman 2</speaker><content>Great. Now we gotta go to the hospital.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Homeless. Admitted 24 hours ago with a suspected drug overdose. Her tox screen’s clean, but she’s still delusional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Homeless, usually means crazy; no money. Cuddy’s not going to like this –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> We’re a teaching hospital. No ID. Doesn’t even seem to know her name. I got called in because of some lesions on her arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Homeless always means no roof, at least, there’s too much sun</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The lesions were non-cancerous, but I noticed a twitch. Her wrist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Mmph</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You feel that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>Sure. I’m human.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Make a fist around my fingers, tight as you can. Squeeze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right.  All right. Raise your arms above your head for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> Oh… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> She’s seizing. Get me some Ativan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She doesn’t want to be discharged. She’s manipulating me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It’s real. Check her finger sticks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blood sugar’s 38. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I need D15. IV push stat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fake low blood sugar. Now that’s acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The blood sugar was real. But she’s probably diabetic. OD’d on her own insulin.  I need 2032. Do you have her effects out here?  Look, a seizure buys her a place to sleep while the nice doctors run their tests, maybe a few free meals.  $20 says there’s insulin in here.  Oh… put this back, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What about the twitch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her arm moved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why fake a twitch? In case the seizure was too subtle? A twitch could indicate a tumor, which could indicate–</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> A need to see a neurologist, which is why you called me. Keep an eye on her until 2:00 PM, watch her blood sugar, give her a nice hot lunch, and discharge her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content/></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s wrong</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman is wrong? The neurologist is wrong, about a neurological problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, you figure he’s not being objective</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House, the woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Both of which Foreman saw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He just wanted her out the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman’s the guy you want to take a swing at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I - just - want her to get some medical attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That’s not even close to being true. Something else. Something personal.  Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The twitch could be a mini-seizure, unrelated to the diabetes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Brain tumor? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Glad you could join us, Eric. What’s the differential for a twitch in the wrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient’s a thirty-ish Jane Doe. I just thought I’d discharge her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Well, she’s my patient. No harm in a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A blow to the head? A subdural hematoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Read the file, no evidence of cranial trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A twitch could indicate a brain tumor</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or about a dozen other things. Come on, there’s two things homeless people are good at – getting sick, and running scams. If you’re so worried about it being a brain tumor, get her an MRI, when she’s clear on that, then you can bounce her out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, you’ve got her all figured out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I’ve known a lot more homeless people than you have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, you’ve got that going for you. How could I have doubted your medical opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The big question, you’re missing it, all of you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh, geez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. Why are we on this case – just because Wilson asked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do I need a better reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Most people wouldn’t, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe is that her name isn’t Jane Doe. Which means no medical history. Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment – we have no baseline, no context for medical treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Wow. Looks just like insulin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Vomit. Still moist.  What do you think - a couple of days old? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Uhhh… trying to make me hurl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. And here’s the big finish… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Salty. Chemical imbalance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Low magnesium could cause a twitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or high calcium. Or it’s a coincidence. The point is, we don’t know anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> So do the MRI. Find out –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The MRI can wait. Hang a banana bag, give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance, we’ll take it from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great. Thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. Even if she’s not faking, what’s so fascinating about this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At the moment, how much you don’t want me to take it. That’s pretty fascinating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman. In fact, he’s never looked better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> He doesn’t like me. I can tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’s okay. He doesn’t like me either. Who’s James?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> Ow! Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pain in your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content> Get away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> All right, let’s get it out. One milligram of Ativan, push.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Jane</speaker><content>NO! NO! NO! NO! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She bit me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good news is, she’s negative for HIV and hep-C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah? Well, I’m getting a tetanus shot, she’s getting an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There’s a two day wait for non-emergency MRIs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s getting an MRI. And then she’s out of here. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Now Dr. Terharg specifically said I’d have the MRI at 10:00, it’s almost 11:00, and I haven’t even had the pretest yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Sorry, we’re a little backed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Uh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Excuse me, you’re Dr. Terharg’s 10:00?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I’m Angela Whitney. I’m meeting my decorator at 11:30, she’s coming all the way from New York. Dr. Terharg promised I’d be home in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Of course. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’s just about prepped for her MRI? Mrs. Whitney?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You tried to steal someone else’s test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Dr. Terharg is a plastic surgeon. The woman was getting a six-month checkup on a chin implant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I can’t believe you authorized this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Sounds exactly like something I’d do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She can’t have an MRI. The CT scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm, the MRI magnet would have ripped it out of her body. You like the Alien movies? You had no medical history, what were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’ll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She has an electrolyte imbalance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, believes this woman has a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, don’t ever apologize for a medical opinion.  If he’s right, we don’t do this test, the patient dies. Now I realize that you have a specialty of your own, but does yours have anything to do with the brain?  His does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. But nothing more until you find out who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How are we supposed to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us.  Go check out the ‘hood, dawg.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Homeless Man</speaker><content>I don’t know. I’ve seen a lot of faces around here but I don’t think I know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Homeless Man</speaker><content>Hey, I ah, like that jacket. Yeah, it’s all coming to me now. I know where she keeps her stuff.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Homeless Man</speaker><content>Just bats.  I thought the lining would be thicker.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No tumor, nothing. Her brain is clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which means, that girl had surgery just so you wouldn’t get reamed out by Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Not necessarily, there could still be something neurological going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sure, she’s not conning us, the MRI is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not wearing a coat in this weather. That is so wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She drew these.  They might give us a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She sign them? Her name would be a start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All the mythology, the locations, they’re all dependant on life experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Philadelphia. Look at that skyline! It’s very evocative. The Chrysler Building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s a cloud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And the Chrysler Building’s in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mmm… I’m getting Philly. And that cactus, well, that’s a smashed car – car accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> A cactus in Philadelphia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Water – well, water’s October, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the page number 22, so that’s October 2nd, 2002. Ergo, the patient was in a car accident two years ago last October.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> My goodness! Was she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it – with this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Surgical pin. Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in case of recall, tied to a patient’s name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s why you insisted on the MRI. So you could remove the surgical pin from her arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn’t think I was going to do it to save your sorry ass, did you?  You might want to take a look at that. Her name is Victoria Matson, at least that’s the one she used then. Any hospital with the record of treating her should be sending that information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Oh, crap!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her blood work came back an hour ago, magnesium was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Did you change her banana bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stopped the magnesium, started iron dextran for severe anemia.  She’s allergic to iron dextran!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Grab some Epi off the code cart.  Respiratory arrest, call the code!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You have an allergic reaction, can you speak? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s not getting any air. Got the Epi. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Stats down in the 80s and dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We have about another minute. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, we got her sedated and stabilized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And we still think there’s nothing wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, nothing’s changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We almost killed her – that’s different. And we know who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So far we’ve heard from three hospitals with records of Victoria Matson. Seven visits, going back two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Any home addresses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The pin in her arm went in during an ER visit. She wasn’t conscious, so they didn’t get an address. The other visits she gave fake addresses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Any treatment for neurological problems, anything that might explain the twitch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Last winter, Jefferson Hospital in Philly, got treated for frostbite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Baby, it’s cold outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And depression. They put her on Prozac.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, I’d be bummed out too. Zero degrees, living in a box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put her back on it. She cheers up; she might stop biting people</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There’s a billing record from Hartman Hospital last year. Two appointments, ultrasounds, doesn’t say what for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Only if she was expecting an elephant. The appointments were ten months apart. Kept the first, blew off the second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The chart doesn’t say –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Wait a minute. She goes in the first time, they look, they can’t find anything. Ten months later, why should she subject herself to that again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why make a second appointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She didn’t. The nurse made the appointment. They were looking – they were looking for ovarian cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You got all of that from one cancelled appointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>With Jerry Lousing, yeah. He’s an oncologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hang on, her current blood work doesn’t show cancer. CA125 is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And the cancer wouldn’t account for the alleged twitch, or any other of her alleged symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it would. Neoplastic Syndrome associated with the cancer could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth. Ultrasound her ovaries.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Foreman was wrong. I’m starting to wonder about that guy’s medical chops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right.  Shelley Diamond?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content> Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. House is ready to see you now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>The little ones are licking each other again, and Harry’s got a seeping wart on his extra toe. What room should we go to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know, I think I might be coming down with something. Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Just walk out, like I’m not going to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Bye-bye. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Working hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This stuff’s pretty good. Calendrica, works for the counseled genius. Bad guy’s Mr. Fury, fairly generic, no special skills, but apparently very well organized. Think you work hard, try ruling the universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You trying to teach me something here?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keinahora. So, why does he hate homeless people? If it’s an uncle or a grandparent you’d think he’d use it in his college application essay. Family struggles beats a 4.0 GPA any day.</content></utterance>

She’s living out on the streets, breathing all kinds of crap 24/7. The odds are she’s got TB, why can’t she have a nice benign growth to go with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>A solid mass on her ovary. Ovarian cancer’s way more likely.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The Prozac we’ve given her could have triggered Serotonin Syndrome, which would explain the fever.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She probably never took it! Most likely they saw her one time and dumped her out of the ER with a script.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay you two, grab some scalpels and settle this like doctors. Send blood and urine cultures and get a chest x-ray. And fine, take her off Prozac and put her on Bromocryptin for the Serotonin syndrome.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her heart rate dropped when you administered the Adenosine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Two seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s still meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it is, with the delay in treatment, she’s got almost no chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start the treatment. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content> Read the report. I found her lying on the grass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You should read my reports. I make up stuff all the time. What really happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Oh, since it’s you… I found her lying on the grass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. That is a great looking gun. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>It’s not a gun. It’s a taser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s so cool looking. What does it do? Fire about 60,000 volts? At least, that’s what it would take to jack someone’s heart up to 150s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Let’s just say I tell you what happened.  This stays between you and me, right? I found her. Lying. On the. Grass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine.  Don’t tell me. Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.  I watch a lot of cop shows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content/></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The good news is, the heart rate thing’s not connected to her condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well then, she’s dying. The meningitis treatment isn’t helping her, she’s getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that brings us to the bad news. The cop tasered her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The first time he hit her in the thigh, and she just kept going, like it was nothing. Right about here.  She didn’t feel the taser. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Localized numbness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, in that one spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The diabetes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t think so. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No alcohol. Not entrapment syndrome. Can’t be a vitamin deficiency. We can’t chase down every sensory neuropathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that where she bit you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What the hell?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t get angry if you don’t feel anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First there’s localized numbness, then sensitivity to light, disorientation, paranoia, ineffectiveness of sedatives, and then hydrophobia. Fear of water. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Rabies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There’ve only been, what, 20 cases in the last ten years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s because non-homeless people, when they get bitten, they get shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There were bats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She’s dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There’s no treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> How much time does she have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A day, maybe two.  And if you don’t get your shot in, say, the next three hours, I’m going to have to make another affirmative action hire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Do it.  Mmmph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want me to talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And say what? There’s some experimental treatment, but it’s not gonna work. Don’t worry, we can make you comfortable? Doesn’t matter how. She’s gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s what you say to her. Keep that there and rest for a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mmm… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Whoah, whoah, whoah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tell House I need to go out for about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She may not have that long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t want her to die alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You’re going to find James.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m gonna try.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, I must say – he’s done a lot with the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Hey – this is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Man, no one’s been in here for a long time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This has got to be James. Maybe there’s another address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s not James.  Paul. Paul Furia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mr. Fury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Her husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then who’s James?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Her kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Victoria</speaker><content>Oh, I just want to eat you up. You’re so delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Victoria</speaker><content>Aw, look at me, you’re just like your papa. Look at you. Just like your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Foreman. Foreman.  They’re dead.  That car crash two years ago – she broke her arm… and they were killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She was driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>Victoria</speaker><content>James.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. It’s Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>Victoria</speaker><content>You’ve come to take me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. I’ve come to forgive you.  It wasn’t your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>Victoria</speaker><content> I’m so sorry… I’m so sorry… I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know. It’s okay Victoria. It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh.  You followed me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You were wearing rain boots today, but you were parked in the underground garage, so the only reason you’d need boots was if you were hitting the streets… I followed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Didn’t we have a conversation about friendship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. I had some follow up questions. I’ve met your parents, and your brother –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have two brothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t you tell me –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It was irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because he’s not in my life any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that’s relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> This was the last place I saw him, nine years ago. I don’t even know if he’s alive.</content></utterance>
