<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company.  Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa’s you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> You stole my prescription pad and you forged my name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> What'd you tell the cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I lied! He'd have put you away for ten years; after they took your license to practice medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> So, everything's good then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> I lied! To the cops!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally. I didn't do the second, you lied about the first. Game over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Yeah, Tritter's just playing. He's gonna see how clever you are and then just walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Here's another way to look at it. Having forced me to lie to the police, your first concern is securing your "drug-connection"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Joining my father for lunch. I should have called ahead for a table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Dr. House was just--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nothing. What're you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Chips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wanna see something really cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I saw you leaving last Tuesday; practically tripped over two guys on your way out. But you had no problem opening doors. It's called Akinetopsia. You can't see things when they move. And since you haven't been hit by a bus, I assume it's intermittent. Probably accompanied by seizures, which made me think that I can set one off by flashing a...</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content> I can see fine now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>I've had seizures before. Most of the time, they're small. Doctors ran me through all the tests, couldn't find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Any history of epilepsy in your family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>The only things I know that run in my family are they have a lot of chutzpah and the ability to sleep for ten years.  Although I'm not really an expert; Dad never really liked my mother's side of the family and, after she died and he came here, I was raised by a guardian. Wouldn't even know how to get in touch with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>How about your father's side of the family? Any relatives we could speak with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>My father was an only child and my grandparents are dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Well, what did you put down as the person the hospital should contact in an emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content> I-I left it blank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>There's gotta be someone, a friend...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Plenty of friends, just... no one that would care if I was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content> Say, do you mind passing me my backpack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content> Hair of the dog.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Says he had a CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It's probably the simplest explanation. Trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He didn't report any injuries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He didn't report being an alcoholic either. Drinking equals falling down equals trauma equals...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Maybe it's inherited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>How did you jump to genetics?  From his EEG? All you got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's not his EEG. It's his father's. When it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Small seizures aren't unheard of in a patient in a vegetative state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Similarities are interesting though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What caused the vegetative state?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>His house burned down; went back in to get his wife. Firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Not an inherited condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Check out the home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He has a single bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> They still make single beds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Could mean he just doesn't have sex, though there were condoms in the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>House asked you to check out the home for toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No mold, no leaks, no pets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>MRI and LP are both inconclusive. Infection's still possible. Tumor’s less likely than...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg and late-onset Lafora's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Genetic tests take forever. You can't just keep testing him for every inherited condition you think it might be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Visitors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Haven't had any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Only person I've seen in the last week was the pizza delivery guy and he looked pretty healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>There's gotta be someone you're close to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Actually, the person I see most often is my father. He's asleep so he can't stop me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>KYLE</speaker><content>Just feeling a little nauseous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I think his liver's failing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Stop all treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>To see if this is a reaction to our meds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, they obviously aren't helping. Given the fact that he's an alcoholic, there's a good chance his liver wasn't so hot when he came in. Anti-seizure drugs, they just pushed him over the edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>We take him off those meds, what do we put him on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was hoping you'd know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>May be academic, I just started him on dialysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Kidney and liver failure; not too many people come back from that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Trauma's out of the picture. Could still be an infection.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>L-dopa?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You're not waking Kyle. You're waking his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I commend your observational skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You have no reason to think any manner of drugs will wake a man from a coma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Vegetative state. Much easier. This guy's no Terri Schiavo, his brain's all there, he moves around, muscles have barely atrophied, just waiting for a fairy-tale kiss. After I do that, stick a needle in him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The amount of amphetamines alone will be dangerous. Besides whatever the hell else you got in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There are reports out of South Africa about a pill that'd temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state. We've all seen Awakenings. It made me cry. I wanna cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Put the syringe down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I can out draw you, mysterious stranger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> We don't experiment on helpless patients!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Even if you woke him, it would only be for a few hours! A day! Two at the most! You're risking his life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You'll be torturing him and his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Whooaaaaaii!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> I want this patient monitored for the next twenty-four hours.  I want someone with him at all times, to make sure you didn't kill him! I want your ass in my office--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>How much are three and five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content> Eight. Also known as half of sixteen, quarter of thirty-two, two to the third power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Coolest thing ever. Any history of seizure in your family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Liver disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content>No.  How long have I been here? Got the feeling it's uh, been a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content> I know my wife is dead. I don't know how long it's been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Ten years.  What's the last thing you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content>The fire. My wife was in the bedroom. She had taken a sleeping pill. I got Kyle out, went back in for her. I knew I didn't make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>How 'bout your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Your son, Kyle, is a patient here. I'm afraid his condition is serious. He may be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content>No seizure issues on my wife's side either. What about that steak? Nobody ever answered me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Ahh! Rumor in the cafeteria was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Technically, Vegetative State Guy was woken by... yeah, Caustic Guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Gotta get him a steak, before I can ask him anymore questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He doesn't wanna talk about his son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Brain issue? He was asphyxiated. Spent ten years as asparagus. Who knows what damage is in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's possible. 'Course always the simple explanation. Maybe he just doesn't like his son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Only in your world would that be simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The delusion that fathering a child installs a permanent geyser of unconditional love--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Maybe your father's feelings were conditional, not everyone's--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes. Well, of course. That would play into your romantic vision of human...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Terms you would understand. We have an evolutionary incentive to sacrifice for our offspring, our tribe, our friends. Keep them safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Except for all the people who don't. Everything is conditional. You just can't always anticipate the conditions.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>TRITTER</speaker><content>A day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>TRITTER</speaker><content>Has he ever had you, write prescriptions for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>No. What is it you want me to say? That he takes too many pills and is a danger to the hospital. Or he takes too few because he's selling them on the side. Either way, it's ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>TRITTER</speaker><content>I meant the former.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>TRITTER</speaker><content>Can I ask what Dr. House has done to deserve your loyalty? He's not known as a great boss. He's not even much of a friend. Look how he left Dr. Wilson holding the bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>TRITTER</speaker><content> It's odd. You don't know about that. You defend him and he won't even tell you what's happening in his life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Then "no" it is. Cops have a thousand ways to make life difficult for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Quick! What's the kid's status? Gotta get back to our sleeper before he goes looking for the Orgasmatron.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Don't worry about it. We use recyclable clothes now. Wear them once, then eat them. Your son's measles vaccination, d'you remember if he had it and what type it was?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>GABE</speaker><content>You weren't gonna tell me, were ya? I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy says my body will adjust to the drugs, and I'll be a vegetable again by tomorrow; if I'm really lucky, the day after.</content></utterance>

His ancestors had been slaughterers, gravediggers. And this guy knew that he wasn't accepted by the staff, didn't even try, didn't dress well, he didn't pretend to be one of them. The people around that place, they didn't think that he had anything they wanted, except when they needed him.
