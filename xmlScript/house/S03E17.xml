<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Tyson Ritter</speaker><content>You got this whole thing wrong, Em. It’s the rock star that’s supposed to be late, not the rock star photographer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Sorry. Morning sickness. Touch the belly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>It’s the first time I’ve been asked to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Come on. It’s good luck. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Mmm. Ooh</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Get the keynotes behind the drop.  So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Uh, I think people aren’t going to get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Come on. All-American Rejects. Juxtaposing a classic image of Americana with modern pop culture. You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Everyone loves a good juxtaposition. My fans were born in the 90s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>You know what? You do this picture, you’ll gain forty years of fans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Love the Rockwell thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>I thought so. Okay. Kill the house lights. Let’s go.  Hang on. Hey. Who’s in charge of the backdrop? Naomi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content> What’s wrong with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Uh, well the words are completely jumbled.  What? You can read that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>Of course. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>No. Oh, God.  I could be having a… a… What’s the mnemonic? Uh… F. F is for face. Is my smile crooked? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>A. A is for arms. Arms. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Tyson</speaker><content>You should really sit down. Can somebody get her some water. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>S. S is speech. I’m slurring. I’m slurring? Huh. Oh!  Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I’m having a stroke. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Dr. House. My boss says you’re important. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Personally I don’t get what’s so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty. Arms out in front of you.  With your palms up, like you’re holding a pizza. Close your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>It’s so easy, you should consider a career change. Probably make a lot more money. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And he said you and the fetus are fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He didn’t mention your pronator drift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>What’s that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means Mackman is an idiot.  May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>It’s not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what’s really inside them. My eyes okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don’t look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>This is going to happen again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless I can figure out the underlying cause. Puff up your cheeks.  You should be able to keep the air in. It means there’s weakness around the mouth. So, where’d you learn to self-diagnose a stroke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Oh, my uh… baby’s biological father is a neurologist. He once told me the FAST mnemonic could save my life one day so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting pet name. Most people go with “husband” or “pookie.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>He’s gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A man after my own heart. Different magazine, obviously.  I’m rescinding Mackman’s discharge order. My lackeys will be in to do some more tests, take some more blood and empty your catheter bag.  Not a moment you’ll want to cherish. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is… definitely different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It looks almost like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s caring. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Find anything else in the patient’s folder? Like a diagnosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Urinalysis revealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine level over 2.5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ultrasound showed no tumors or stones, no signs of fetal distress, no urinary tract obstructions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>BP is fine. No preeclampsia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any of you guys ever been to the Galapagos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Was our patient there? Dengue fever, avian pox. Even West Nile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I’m looking for a vacation spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That mean we get vacation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How would that differ from your current status?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re going to do what? Relax?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Visiting family. My uncle’s a giant turtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kidneys don’t often get stuck in the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Heart’s way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Echo’s normal. The history indicates no sign of cardiac problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In her throat. That’s the one about 10 inches above the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She was prescribed antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It leads to rheumatic fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which leads to, Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mitral valve stenosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is a thickening in the valve of the…kidney? No. The kidney doesn’t have a mitral valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ll go look at the heart. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’ll be easy to find. It’s the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That was weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He was the way he always is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which is weird.  Stay still, Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No problem.  He caught us with your hand up my shirt. He’s gotta have a reaction to that. You think that’s what the vacation is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes. The pain of losing you is obviously forcing him away. Coronal slice appears normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s no way House just lets this slide. He’s gotta be planning something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe he just doesn’t give a crap. Sagittal slice is clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You think he just stumbled into that closet? He knew we were there. And he wanted us to know that he knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or, you wanted him to know. Now he does and you’re annoyed because he doesn’t care.  Right there. Transaxial slice. Calcified mitral valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Barely. That’s not big enough to throw a clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Obviously it is because it did. House was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The valve in your heart is narrowed. It caused the clot which led to your stroke and the reduced circulation caused the problems with your kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>And this’ll fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The balloon will force the valve back open and you’ll be fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Can I do this without a sedative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s really very mild. There really is no risk to the fetus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’ll monitor the baby’s heart rate separately. We won’t allow it to decrease anywhere near dangerous levels. {She turns on second monitor which shows a heart rate of 208.]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re both going to be fine. Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content> Listen to that heartbeat… Sounds so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Start threading the catheter.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario. That’s why I asked for a direct flight to Phnom Penh.  How hard is it to not land?  Does it matter what I answer? Well then, fine, I’d be delighted to hold.  What’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s her job. What’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The good news is Emma’s heart is fixed. The bad news is it’s not her underlying problem. Her kidneys are still failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re vacationing in Cambodia? You’re going to unwind in the killing fields?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big.  Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Aren’t those catfish critically endangered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s why it’s my last chance to catch one.  If the mitral valve had been fixed, the kidneys should be getting better which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or you screwed up the diagnosis. Mitral valve thickening was so insignificant it probably wasn’t the cause of the kidneys or the stroke. Probably never would have been a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She needs dialysis. And we need a new theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There are only a few possibilities. Patient’s pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hypoperfusion. The fetus is basically a parasite, stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put her on telemetry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or the pregnancy’s irrelevant. Could be infection, sepsis, HUS/TTP –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s it, has to be one of those five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what would be even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Phone</speaker><content>Thank you for holding.  We are experiencing extremely high call volume. Thank you for your patience. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> She’s 0 for 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either the differential was wrong or she’s faking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidney failure has to be precipitated by –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>By one of the five we’ve already ruled out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The body only has so many ways of screwing with the kidneys. The labs must be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We did the labs. No one else had access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not quite true. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content> You put all your patients through this many tests or just the important ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We wanted to explore all the possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’ve eliminated all the possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>You’re telling me I’m dying and you have no idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your body is functioning properly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>So why are my kidneys failing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The other body isn’t. There’s something wrong with the fetus. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome.  Mom’s body is like an intricate German metro system. All the trains run on time. When she gets pregnant, it’s like a new station opening in Dusseldorf. A bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes. Kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted. Before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to Berlin and you’ve got a bunch of angry Germans with nowhere to go. And we all know that ain’t good for the Jews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who are the Jews in this metaphor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A few things can happen to a fetus in distress. It can become a miscarriage, stillbirth, very sick baby or, on rare occasion, a time bomb that kills mom while it’s dying. The good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better. It’s the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ve read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for “dead baby?” You think she’ll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We can tell her the truth – that she’ll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can’t touch it, can’t ask where it hurts, can’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If only there existed giant machines that could look through human skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein’s anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen’s vein –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And Dr. Storm Cloud rained all over the differential and killed the beautiful little baby. Heart’s easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let’s start there. When you did Mom’s MRI did you get a look at the fetus’ heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we need another scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. We’ll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No need. I’m going to paralyze it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You want to paralyze Emma Sloan’s baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me guess. Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Cameron and Chase both had their concerns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn’t want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They’re sleeping together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If by “sleeping together” you mean having sex in the janitor’s closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, the janitor’s closet at the local high school.  Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I will deal with them after I deal with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Let’s gossip some more. I’m sure she’s into bondage. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re gonna need to get her consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That shouldn’t be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m going with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The injection goes into the umbilical cord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The baby won’t feel a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fetus! I’m lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It must be easier to hear that you might die than your baby might die. But if there’s anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be Dr. House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fetus. Hold this.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. Cameron, the MRI results back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The fetus’ heart is structurally sound. The problem’s with the bladder. It’s four times normal size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Let me see. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The bladder’s so engorged it’s taking up the whole torso, squeezing all the other organs. There’s no room for the lungs to develop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> The baby has a lower urinary tract obstruction. We can fix that by inserting a shunt. I’ll give Emma the news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you… taking over the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House won’t care. He has his diagnosis.  Dr. Cameron. Dating Chase… can only end in one of two ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House told you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You get married and live happily ever after or somebody gets hurt and you two can’t work together and I have to fire somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I would hate to see my personal life become such a burden to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m telling you this for your own good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Well I assume you’re going to have this same conversation with Chase for his own good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Chase isn’t the one who’s gonna get hurt here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s only room for one. Though I could scooch over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>My social life is my social life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Couldn’t agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor’s closet is nobody’s business except –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She told me to end it. Is that what you want?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m an insane genius. Set the chamber to low pressure instead of high. Thinner air builds up extra red blood cells. Creates new capillaries. Few more days in here and I can save myself six weeks in base camp. Where’s my MRI? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There’s a blockage in the urinary tract. Simple terms, your baby can’t pee. His bladder is swollen and it’s crushing his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Well, can you fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We can insert a small tube in the baby’s bladder that makes the bladder come out straight through his belly for the duration of the pregnancy. The bladder decompresses and the lungs will be able to develop normally. When the baby gets better, you should get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>First we just have to do a test to determine whether the baby’s kidneys are functioning properly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>And what if they’re not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If they’re already too damaged, then there’s really nothing we can do. If this doesn’t work out, you can always try again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Wow. I miscarried twice when I was married. After the divorce, I tried in vitro like four times before this. I’m 42. Maybe it's, uh, just not meant to be.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you’re trying to be me so I thought I’d try to be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don’t have the cleavage for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But I have a much tighter ass. You think every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron?  Let me see the results of the bladder tap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They aren’t back yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They’re gonna to be inconclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You think my diagnosis is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fetus doesn’t pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom’s level is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Doesn’t mean I’m wrong. Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either way, your test will be inconclusive. The urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus’ bladder for weeks. And, as my pappy always said, “stale pee is useless pee.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine, then I’ll do another tap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just as useless. Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap ‘cause it’s all backed up. Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee and it’s when you’ll find out if this fetus has even a fighting chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you. I’ll run two more taps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’s an important patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because she takes pictures? Or because she’s you? Woman in her forties. Single. Using a turkey baster as a last gasp of motherhood. And you want to make sure she succeeds, so you’ll still have hope. Can’t be a good doctor if you’re not objective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> It’s your file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then why did you just say all that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To humiliate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re taking the case back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even fetuses lie. We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one. What if that’s not the whole story. What if the little bugger is hiding something? Real reason for the mirror syndrome. Have we looked under its bed? Have we checked its diary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not GU. Could be the heart. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The swollen bladder was not the only problem. We can’t leave it inside you. We have to terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Well, can’t you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory machine until you figure out what’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can. And it won’t matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not a baby. It’s a…tumor.  I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your child might live. But that’s not the choice here. Either it dies or you both die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Or you fix him and we both live.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>I won’t consent.  So I guess you have two days to figure it out. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She’s developed severe DIC. You have to force her to terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby’s lung development?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prevent lung development. I’m trying to extinguish the human race one fetus at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they’re the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My real patient is dying. Very quickly. Like I wouldn’t advise her to buy any green bananas. The fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point. Removing it is an instant cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re not going to get Emma to see it that way. She’s probably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, you get it. She’ll listen to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You let this woman refuse to terminate, you’re helping her commit suicide. As her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then she’d be an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Too bad she’s your boss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What if our original assumption is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It isn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If we assume she doesn’t have mirror syndrome then terminating her pregnancy isn’t going to help her liver at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We eliminated all other possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma’s kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. If the ass kisser won’t agree with you, you must be even wronger than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. Let’s assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby’s bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don’t have to terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So her theory is that our patient’s liver problems were just a giant coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s not a surprising coincidence. Pregnant women can develop liver problems. If this is the case, we can actually do something here. Don’t you guys think that’s worth exploring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy would have the same symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s not joking? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Be patient. She’s going through all of us. She’ll get that jungle fever eventually. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You love him? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This can probably wait until after we biopsy Emma’s liver, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can’t. Her platelets are too low. Once we pierce her liver, it will be next to impossible to stop the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Come in from above. Instead of going straight in through her abdomen, go in through the veins in her neck. Transjugular hepatic biopsy. If the liver starts to bleed, it will bleed right back into her own veins.  Why don’t you start your vacation now?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s nothing. She’s only doing it to make House jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then why are you doing it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You obviously care very deeply about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m not protecting her. I’m protecting myself. A heartbroken, lovesick Cameron would be even more unbearable than she is now. You’re through the hepatic vein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Firing the needle. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heart rate and BP spiking. Get that out of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fetus’ heart rate just dropped to 50.  We’ve got contractions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pre-term labor. Start a terbutaline drip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We were able to control the pre-term labor with tocolytics. The contractions have subsided, for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And the biopsy was negative. This is definitely mirror syndrome. Her baby’s doing this to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re out of options.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor or did it happen on its own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It doesn’t make a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Pre-term labor can be a new symptom. New information gives us new theories. Isn’t that how it works?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not in this case. Her body’s trying to do what you refuse to – get the baby out and save itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The patient’s transaminases are ten times normal. Her liver’s on the verge of shutting down completely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A torch test could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We don’t have time for more tests. We have to terminate or she’ll die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then let’s work faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Medicine doesn’t work faster just because you hope real hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But it could help to see what the baby’s been hiding. The only organ we haven’t been able to look inside is its lungs. The problem must be in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We haven’t been able to see inside because they’re underdeveloped. We’ve already got her on corticosteroids but it’ll take weeks for them –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then let’s drown them in corticosteroids. Multiple courses. Speed up their development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Giving the baby more than one course will suppress adrenal gland function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have long-term adverse effects on fetal organ development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Worse than death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Emma’s already on tocolytics. The combination could put her into pulmonary edema. You’ll just kill her faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s the only chance we have to see inside those lungs. We’re just going to have to make the baby better faster than we make Emma worse.  Come on. This is the kind of thing House does every day.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He wouldn’t share your pain. He’d be objective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right. He would prioritize his problems. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’d terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He wouldn’t be afraid of screwing with her lungs if there was a bigger issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There is no bigger issue. She needs her lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not right now. She’s already on a respirator. The machine is breathing for her. I can do whatever I want to her lungs. If you’re playing catch in the living room and you break your mother’s vase you might as well keep playing catch. The vase is already broken.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I got the baby’s lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cab’s on its way. I have to finish packing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to believe when everyone around you is telling you that you’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Helps to know they’re idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you think I’m an idiot? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not objective. But you’re not an idiot.  His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But big enough for a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These tissue buds are new. Could indicate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic eventration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was thinking bronchogenetic cysts or bronchial atresia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be lung lesions. CCAM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What about – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Move. </content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I thought you started your vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Somebody had to save our boss’ rotundous ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Small buds in the lungs could indicate –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and “none of the above.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Portable MRI’s in her room. We could get a current image –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fetal lungs are so tiny an MRI won’t give us the details we need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What would we do if this patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He… is a person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it’s a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what’s in the lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Transesophageal echo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Can’t access his esophagus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Higher resolution CT could give us a clearer –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Too much radiation for a one-pound person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You can’t just shoot everything down, Chase. You’re not me. Collaborate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A ventilation perfusion scan would be next. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope? Idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If it were really a person and we had no other options, we’d do an exploratory surgery. Cut into his chest and have a look around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let’s do that.  You’re the one who insists we treat it like a person. I’ll put it back when I’m done. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Me again. Your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter.  We’re going to do open fetal surgery. Open the uterus cut out the fetus so we can look around. I know you can’t talk so I need you to look petrified if you consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The umbilical cord won’t be cut. During surgery your body will basically serve as the baby’s heart-lung machine. We find what’s wrong and we fix it. If we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Don’t lower expectations if you want them to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She should know what she’s facing.  This is incredibly dangerous. It risks both your lives. The only reason why we’re suggesting it is because there’s nothing else we can do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mind each other’s personal space. There are sharp implements in the room. Like this one.  Uterus is fully exposed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>And we’re in. Start draining the amniotic fluid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you never sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg? Where’d you go to college? Gimme that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Affix the pulse ox to the palm.  House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry. I just realized I forgot to TiVo “Alien.” </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fetal heart rate good, stats are stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Position him for the incision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>All right, I see three well-defined lesions. It’s definitely CCAM. I should be able to resect them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s the mom. She’s in V-fib.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Charging. Clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>I’m clear. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like asystole. Paddling’s not going to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s fine V-fib. I’m going again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re going to lose them both. Clamp! The surgery’s not doing this to her, the fetus is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Step away, House. I’m going again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You keep going, you’re going to get electrocuted.  Going again. Clear. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>Heart rate’s returning to normal.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Emma</speaker><content>Sorry. So this really worked. He’ll be… normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Um. If you call being born twice, normal. </content></utterance>
