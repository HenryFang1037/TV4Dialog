He was lowered head first into the water. His ankles were locked and bolted to the top of the tank. I'm going to need a volunteer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Ooh, ooh, ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> The guy dislocating his shoulder, right there.  Yeah. Could you tell the guy next to you to come up? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Come on, get up there, man. Get up there, get up there! Come on!  Come on! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> Hi, have we met before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>See, if you'd said yes, you could have gone back to your seat. Now, can you vouch for this audience that this is a glass tank full of water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>No, you can't. You haven't done anything yet, come on.  Knock on the glass. Solid glass. Knock on it.  It's real water too. Ilana, splash the guy.  Does that feel wet to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>And you think that proves it's water? I think we have met. Do you know the public washroom behind the truck stop east of Omaha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>See, if you'd said yes, that would have been so funny. Hold out your arms for me.  You've done this before, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Again, two choices and you went for the unfunny one.  Now remember, there's only one thing you've got to be able to do. Drag a screaming, crying, shackled man out of a tank of water. Up!  Hey, you can swim, right?  Whoa, whoa, whoa tell me you can swim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> Two answers man, two answers! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Is that part of the act?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Aww.  Five eager doctors and no sick people. Let us try and fill our spare time with a new challenge. The winner gets immunity...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I have a sick guy. I saw this magician last night...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The girl's fine. He didn't really cut her in half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>His heart stopped while he was hanging upside down in the water tank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>A drowning man's heart stopped, that is a mystery. Along with immunity, the winner gets to nominate two...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>He lost consciousness almost as soon as he hit the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You have to leave work at 6:00 pm, but you make time for man dates?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Are we not allowed to be friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, I'm just hurt. When I asked you to come see Mamma Mia...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>No history of heart disease. No angina. No...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>About his history? ER confirmed...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>About everything. He's a magician, that's what they do. He screwed up the trick, he started drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>You were talking about a challenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The winner nominates two of your competitors. I will fire one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Even if he was drowning, it would have taken longer to set off a cardiac incident without some underlying problem...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine. Go run your tests. If you're wrong, you're fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>If I'm right, do I stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If I say no, are you going to let your patient die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>What's the challenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We can all applaud the doctor who's willing to break all the rules. But the real hero is the unsung doctor, toiling in anonymity, because he broke the rules without getting caught. I need to know you have these skills. I need you... To bring me the thong of Lisa Cuddy.  Not kidding.  Thong. Cuddy. Go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's how I got hired. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>If you want to stand on principle, I really respect you for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>It's childish, unprofessional, and inappropriate. The job is not worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>We should all beg off. Tell him we failed. No winners, no losers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>You're going to do it, aren't you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>If you didn't sound so despondent, I'd say that was good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>13</speaker><content>It is for you, not for him. Notice any heaviness in your legs the last couple days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> Why isn't it good news for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Because, if there's nothing wrong with you, he gets fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Somewhat seriously. Your legs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Pick a card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>13</speaker><content>You don't seem too worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Would you please pick a card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>13</speaker><content> Our boss thinks your cardiac arrest was just a result of you accidentally drowning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Your boss is an idiot. Put it back.  Shuffle 'em up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>13</speaker><content> So then why aren't you worried?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Either I'm dying or I'm not. I mean, I don't want the ride to be over.  But unless worrying is some new form of treatment...  Your card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I'm going to prep you for a transesophageal echo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> You sure you shuffled these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>And I'm going to need to sedate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Might want to check your wallet first.  Would you check your wallet? It's part of the trick.  Whoa. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>13</speaker><content> That's my card. How did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Do it again. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>You trying to will them off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>If I had a plan, the first part would be not telling YOU what the plan was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> You haven't touched that coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Yes I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>She can't keep her panties on if they're wet.  We work together. One wins, protects the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Or I win by myself, and then you try desperately to convince me to spare you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Dr Cuddy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Dr Taub, are you okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're reporting to me because you're scared to report to House, because you found nothing, because this isn't a case.  And you thought I'd save your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Yeah.  I thought he was sick, what was I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>What about his lungs? Decreased oxygen saturation leads to heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>ER didn't find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>ER wasn't looking, too busy trying to keep him alive. Get an MRI. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy to come to the nurse's station? Stat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>I asked you to get doctor...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Right now, it's just a theory. We don't even know if it's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I knew I shouldn't have done those mushrooms in college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I'm sure there's no connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>It was a joke. You really lose your sense of humour when your job's on the line, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Sorry, most dying people don't really like to... Not that you're dying. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>But a little sick would be perfect, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Ah, ow, ah! Ow! My stomach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Stabbing or throbbing?  Grey turner's sign. He's got internal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I'll call surgery. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Surgeons have transfused three units AB positive, but they're still looking for the source of the bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> No trauma. Could be liver disease, Vitamin K deficiency. The only thing we know for sure it's not... nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>13</speaker><content>And we would have noticed something chronic like liver disease, it's probably an intestinal infarct... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Hey. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>13</speaker><content> I got it! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Ahem.  Eau de Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No way, how did you get them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Only one way. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>These are not Cuddy's panties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You don't think that I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No. Also, she's wearing a red bra today.  Like I'm the only one who noticed. Means the downstairs will match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Do your research, people. An intestinal infarct could be linked to the cardiac arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Hike up your skirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> Wow that's rude even for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hike it down then. You're wearing a black bra. Let's see the underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You two cut a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>If you're not cheating, you're not trying hard enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>So you're not wearing any underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Uh, there's a guy bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Foreman. She's not wearing any underwear. You used to be more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>She's not wearing any underwear - Big deal. When she stops wearing clothes, then we can drop the medical stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Let me see the MRI film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>We didn't get any images, he started screaming as soon as I turned it on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Define soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Uh... I didn't even get a chance to sit down.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Look familiar? The MRI's magnet ripped this through your intestine into your spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Forgot about that. On account of almost dying. Where's Dr. Kutner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's no longer on your case, because there's nothing wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I didn't screw up that trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Everything that's happened can be explained by you being forgetful and incompetent. You screwed up, you passed out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Know my favourite time to lie? When my life hangs in the balance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Your life doesn't hang in the balance. You know your life doesn't hang in the balance. Your reputation might hang...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>You ever do magic as a kid? You seem like the type. Lonely, obsessive.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I am not a hack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> If I tell you how it's done, will you go home?  So you going to make it magically appear in my wallet?  You are a hack. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I don't screw up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>A nosebleed that major means he's actually sick. Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom.  Stop gloating.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then what's that smirk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>No smirk, this is how I look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>What about the underwear challenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I declare it officially on hold.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>You think I'm lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, I want to give you a reward. Yes, I think you're lying. Cardiac arrest plus nose bleed, Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Uh... patient has no significant family history, no angina, no prior attacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>What if it isn't his heart? What if it's the vessels around his heart? Polyarteritis nodosa causes cardiac symptoms and hypertension, which makes his nose bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You know what else makes your nose bleed and your heart race? Cocaine. Guy works in a B-List nightclub in Atlantic City, he's got to be taking regular rolls in the snow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You,  take the gloater to the patient's drug den. Make sure you pat down his pockets before you leave. You  and Big Love, biopsy a blood vessel from around the heart, test for polyarteritis nodosa. You...  In my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Those aren't my panties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know. Hypothetical. A young woman does something clumsy in public, and instead of laughing it off, she gets irrationally upset. Explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Maybe she's clumsy because she's nervous, because she forgot to do her spelling homework. Or in my hypothetical, she's eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But this girl's not insecure. Seems more like she's afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Do you have a point, or did you just get a new book of riddles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think you're hiding a medical condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I'm not.  I'm glad we had this talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms because they think they can't get sick. If you've got something going on, I need you to take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>13</speaker><content>And I take your compassion entirely at face value.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's not compassion. It's self interest, I want my team healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>13</speaker><content>It's not self interest. It's curiosity. I dropped a file, House. I start bleeding from the eyes, I'll be sure to make an appointment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Of course not, but it'd be irresponsible to leave it here.  You have a quarter?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>They were never on her. No way those are hers.  Uh-Huh. Tularaemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Nah he'd have to have rabbits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>True. Maybe, a tick jumped from a rabbit and landed on one of these white, fluffy alligators.  Then it jumps onto our patient, transfers the bacteria, causes pericarditis. Explains everything.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You eat a lot of beets, you have an electric toothbrush, and you sleep less than six hours a night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The red betamine from the beets stains the plaque deposits on your teeth, which are then swirled by your spinning toothbrush. Your heavy lids and your prematurely aging skin tell me that you're carrying a major sleep debt.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>If he developed DIC after the surgery, even a normal biopsy bleeds out of control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So cardiac arrest and DIC, what's the common denominator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Could be cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>13</speaker><content>We've been looking in his chest since he got here, it's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>So the main mass is somewhere else, throws up a clot, blocks an artery in his heart, causes the arrest. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>There's a dark spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Damage from where the key ripped through. You're probably expecting me to bash the others, give examples of how they screwed up, you know I can. I'm a good doctor. As good as anybody around here, probably better and you know that's the only thing that matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>It's not a tumour, it's another bleed. This one's in his kidney.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If you're going to kiss his ass to protect your ass, at least wait until he's had a good idea. It's a symptom of him being a charlatan. He's a second-rate magician with a mysterious illness, why wouldn't he predict his own death? If he's wrong, we all forget it, if he's right, he goes out a legend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>He got scared right after a transfusion. Tainted blood has been known to cause a sense of impending doom, could also explain the DIC.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Not when it's caused by drowning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So your new theory is that you were an idiot to take this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Yes. Can I go test that theory now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow transplant for the amyloidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You'd have to irradiate him first. If they're right about the blood, you'd be destroying his immune system for nothing.  Which could be a good thing, does he have a really crappy life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Of course, you're type AB. Universal recipient, you take from everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Of course, you're type O. Universal donor. No wonder you're paying three alimonies.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm sorry I doubted you. Be a shame if your secrets died with you. Perhaps you've got that trick written down somewhere? Or maybe you want to tell me, and I'll write it down for you. That way... you can live on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content> I'm taking it with me. See, that way, it stays magic.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Up my sleeve. It's not amyloidosis. And his blood's fine, we just gave him the wrong type. Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding, multisystem failures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>13</speaker><content>But we tested his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That's because we don't test blood for type. We test for antibodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Because your body only makes those antibodies when you actually have that type of blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Apparently, he has one more symptom, his body's making an extra antibody, type B. Combine that with his natural type A, and presto change-o, he magically pulls blood type AB out of his hat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>You said I don't have to justify my picks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No... I said you could use whatever criteria you want, doesn't mean I don't want to know. He was right about this being a real case, he was right about the botched transfusion and he's your love nugget. You've got no reason to pick him.  But somebody else does. Kutner's a liability. He electrocuted himself, lit a patient on fire, it's only a matter of time before he burns the hospital down. You made a deal with Cuddy. That's how you got her underwear. She sold it to you for the right to put her choices on the block.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Her rules, not mine. The whole point of this was to subvert Cuddy. You became her partner, gave her power she didn't already have. Let her greedy fingers into my cookie jar, which, sadly is, not as dirty as it sounds. Thanks for playing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I don't want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, you're afraid to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I might die. So could you, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow. The only difference is you don't have to know about it today, so why should I?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>13</speaker><content>You spend your whole life looking for answers. Because you think the next answer will change something, maybe make you a little less miserable. And you know that when you run out of questions, you don't just run out of answers, you run out of hope. You glad you know that?</content></utterance>
