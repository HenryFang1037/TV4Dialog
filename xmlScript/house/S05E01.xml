<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>You suggested it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>I suggested you look into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Sorry. The online reviews —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Were obviously written by some geek in their own marketing department. Next time, call someone you know. Stop relying on a computer to do your job for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Bright Size Apparel. Eight sexual harassment suits in two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Who asked for the meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>They did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Patty Michener, president of Women's Majority.  And wow — do you guys need me! Nine men. No one thought it might be a good idea to put a suit on one of the gals from the steno pool to make it look like you give a damn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CEO</speaker><content>We've made it a priority to promote more women, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Well, from now on you have me standing beside you, which is good.  Because your problem is a national problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CEO</speaker><content>With all due respect, Miss Michener, I'd hardly call a few isolated incidents a national problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Six out of ten victims never even report harassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Flunky</speaker><content>That still only means 20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>Not enough for you? How many asses does your corporate policy allow you to grab? Tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna settle with anyone you haven't settled with. You're gonna fire any man who’s even been accused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Somebody help me! Please help me. I can't get 'em off! Please help me! Help me, please! Somebody help me! Get 'em off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Patty</speaker><content>You gonna call an ambulance, or are you just gonna sit there and stare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content> Help me, please!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wilson's back. You gonna say —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's been gone two months. He can wait till I finish slaying a guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>On a video game you stole from the pediatric ward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On advice of counsel, I assert my privilege pursuant to the fifth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>When was the last time you talked to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, I think it was after... When did his girlfriend die? He wanted time alone. I considered being a horrendous pain in the ass, but I didn't want to tread on your turf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> We got a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've gotta remember to close the blinds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just got a call from Patty Michener from Women's Majority, the women's rights —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We know who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I dated her. Well, not really dated her. More metaphorically raped her by having a penis.  You did too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her assistant flipped out. Ripped off her clothes in front of a room full of businessmen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, either she cracked under the whip, or she started to realize that her evolutionary purpose is to arouse men, not to castrate them. Send her to psychiatric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal pain aren't psychiatric symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then it's the latter. Send her to my apartment. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll give it to Segal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House actually wants a case, and you're saying no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House has more important things to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, can't help you. You need a specialist to remove those kind of warts. Preferably one with experience spelunking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hallucinations, possible memory loss. Tests show anemia, slow heart rate, and a stubborn refusal to shave her pits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Have you seen Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. But I have seen the patient's frequent flyer balance. Eastern Europe, Asia, third-world countries. Sometimes more than one a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No fever means it's not a tropical disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If it's not where she went, maybe it's the work hours. Could be amphetamine abuse. She's probably popping them like breath mints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You haven't been by his office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is Wilson hallucinating ants crawling all over him too? Tox screen's cleaner than the windows she won't do. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her job keeps her constantly on the road, probably living off of airline peanuts and diet soda. Severe B12 deficiency could cause all her symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why is everyone leaping to conclude a strong career woman's been made sick by her strong career? It's not B12, it's an insulinoma in her pancreas. It's making her hypoglycemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Great. Now everyone knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You knew the patient had cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that what she said? I thought she said, "I am suddenly and irrationally defending the patient's strong career, even though in reality she's just a glorified grunt, because I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay not to have a life because I don't have a life, because I was tested for Huntington’s, and my life span's been cut in half." Been waiting two months for her to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hallucinations, anemia, bradycardia —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hyper segmented polys says that Taub's right. Pump her full of B12. See how a strong career woman's been made sick by her strong career.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be years before you see any symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why wouldn't you tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't have Huntington’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Are you lying to us… because it's none of our business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If it's none of your business, then I shouldn't have to answer these questions. And I wouldn't have to, except House doesn't want to answer questions about Wilson. He's deflecting his own problems onto me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Are you deflecting now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Time for the B12 cocktail and my life lesson.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>No, Patty’ll do the hearing. She just needs to be the leadoff witness so — Okay, I'll lock it down today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I need you back in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>My boss has a big Beijing trip. I've been planning it for months. I was just tired and dehydrated and —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, whenever I lose some shut-eye, I pound my legs, clawing at imaginary ant colonies. You have a severe B12 deficiency. Get back in bed.  I'm sure your boss can do without you for a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>It's not about her. It's about me. I want to be there. I want to matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, without you, who knows how much starch they'd put in her shirts?  I'm sorry, I'm sure your boss depends on you for —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I need to get up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, you need to stay in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Please, where's a bed pan? Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I just… I just had a bowel movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's okay, B12 deficiency can cause sudden —  That's not a bowel movement.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My patient is still fighting in the feminist trenches, but the war is over. Yesterday's sluts are today's empowered women. Today's sluts are celebrities. If that isn't progress —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, are you gonna take another two months? Boy, you're really milking this bereavement thing, aren't you?  I mean, good for you. You take all the time you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm resigning. Maybe moving out of New Jersey. I don't know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. That's an understandable reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not a reaction. It's a decision. I'm writing Cuddy my resignation right now. I'm just back for the week to wrap up my clinical and administrative duties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You of all people should know, this is bereavement 101. You think that a change of venue —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, that spares me decades of psychoanalysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not saying you're not in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're saying my pain's a cliché.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm saying that pain fades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Physical pain is different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'd rather have my leg chopped off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you don't know that 'cause you haven't felt —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Neither have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Sorry, patient's got a rectal bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We need you to —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, as you can see, I’m not busy. It's just a euphemism for "get the hell out of here."  This is your grief talking. And, yeah, it is a bit textbook. So before you give away all your possessions to the Salvation Army —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My girlfriend's dead. I'm glad you've read that book before. I haven’t. I'm late to meet Dr. Olin to brief him on the cases I’m handing over. Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It doesn't bother you that House wouldn't take just two seconds to talk about the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wilson's dealing with a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And our patient may be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She was bleeding out her rear. We're looking up her rear. You think we needed House's expertise to set us on this course?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Her heart rate's slow—bleed should have made it faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And it can wait till after we know where it came from, and after he's done dealing with personal issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah? That the way it works around here? We get cut slack while we deal with personal issues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> You're not the boss. Boss gets to make the rules. Boss gets to ignore… She's bleeding from... nowhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You did an endoscopy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>CT scan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ordered, but it shouldn't show anything the endoscopy didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> We can't do a CT scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We don't need a CT scan. We don't need House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Stop grinning and talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>One of the routine pre-procedure tests was positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The one that, if it's positive, would explain a hormone imbalance that could screw with heart rate and blood flow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Guess she does have a life beyond her career.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I'm pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You want me to call the father and let him know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Soon as you do some DNA testing. Let me know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Must be hard to have a real relationship when you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Are you making excuses for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm just saying it's understandable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>You only have to understand something if it needs an explanation. I have needs. I met my needs. End of explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How recently were you... needy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Oh, it's been two or three months, at least.  What? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's actually nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The ultrasound shows no trace of a baby at all.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>B12 deficit rectified, but her heart's slowing even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>And a bleed should speed her heart rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, this is the kind of case you love.  Contradictions piling up left and right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Two false positive pregnancy tests, bradycardia, lower GI bleed. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Choriocarcinoma — would’ve triggered pregnancy hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Also would have shown on a sonogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Immunoglobulin "A" deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No urinary bleed. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If she's had beta HCG injections, they can cross-react with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're being an idiot. You're gonna blow up your career. And six months from now, when you've moved on from Amber to burnt sienna, you're gonna be stuck in a mobile oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'd need a flow chart to explain all the ways in which that was ridiculously insensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can't hide from misery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This isn't your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My skull was cracked open trying to save her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then we all need a little tea and sympathy. I'm through discussing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Uh, we have a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's obviously not going anywhere with a bloody rectum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Great to have you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Actually, I'm —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, he’s about to thrust a tantō into the belly of his career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm leaving the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry, this is obviously a terrible time —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why are you leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just need a change of scenery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Buy a plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Rectal bleeding, two positive pregnancy tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's nothing we can do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You could ask House to be a grown-up and respect my decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I respect things that deserve respect. This decision, on the other hand, is a dog wearing a cape!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hallucinations. Heart won't respond —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The patient tested positive for pregnancy because the patient is pregnant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Hey, who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> This is Dr. House. He's too brilliant for introductions.  False positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're too busy to be running a Day Care Center in your abdomen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>False positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to mention you should wait till at least 30 to punish that pleasure portal with a seven-pound tissue expander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I'm 37. And I thought I wasn't pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> 37? Impressive. Too bad you’re not passing on those genes.  Does that look false to you? You were looking in the wrong room. It's more common when the egg lands in the oven. Sometimes it winds up in the fallopian tubes. In rare cases, it plummets through the plumbing entirely. It's using her intestine as a blood supply. It caused the rectal bleed, and now... Junior Miss Steinem’s junior must be pressing on her vagus nerve, slowing her heart to a crawl. Yank the fetus. She survives the surgery, she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What if she wants to keep the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What, we can't take two seconds to discuss this? I mean, fetuses have been transplanted before. Whole uteruses too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just terminating the fetus when it's glued to her intestines is high-risk surgery. Saving it is a fantasy. That was at least three seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's a 37-year-old woman who deserves —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People get what they get. It has nothing to do with what they deserve. And this has nothing to do with her genitalia, and everything to do with your genetics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You told me to get tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't know it was gonna color your every medical opinion, every personal opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You didn't think a death sentence would —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> People die! You, Amber, everyone. Don't act like you just figured that out. I gave you a diagnosis. You don't like it, there are exits on every floor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry to be so definitive about this. I know you're still absorbing the news, but we have no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Remove the fetus. Absolutely. I have no boyfriend, no husband. I'm on the road with Patty all the time. Where do I sign?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>No, not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Treating professional sports injuries now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>No, I'm not —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Familiar with the concept of sarcasm. Don't sweat it, it's new.  Have you spoken to Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We'll get you an EKG. I'll be right back.  You want me to sleep with him to get him to stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I put the bisexual chick on that. If you'd like to sit in, so to speak...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I spoke to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What'd you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I didn't tell him anything. I listened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you could feel good about doing nothing. You gotta tell him —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I am not your errand girl. Best thing about leaving you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>The two of you used to be together?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I already talked to him twice. He threw me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mocking him and insulting him, let's see… Yes, technically those are categories of conversation.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Talk to him. Deal with his grief. Talk to him about what he's going through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a brilliant idea. I'll take him out for a beer. That'll make up for the fact that Amber's in a pine box. That there's randomness and chaos in the universe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't ask her to come out. I wasn't driving the bus. I wasn't driving the garbage truck that hit the bus. And I did not prescribe her the flu meds that killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, I know, that's all true. But... You really don't feel any sense of guilt? You want to keep him, he needs to know he's not alone. Just tell him you feel like crap.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her heart's stabilized. We have a pacing wire in her, but the bradycardia is not getting any better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House is bluffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I called him three times. He's not picking up.  What do you want us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The same thing you'd do if he was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If he was here, we'd be asking him what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What are the usual suspects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There aren't any. She had a vitamin deficiency, and we corrected it, an ectopic pregnancy, we removed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>But her heart problem won’t go away, and now something's wrong with her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have complete confidence in you guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who wants to go service House so this patient can live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can do this without him. Maybe something happened during the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The surgery was on her bowel, not her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Anxiety, stroke, Tourette's could all cause eye blinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And cause her heart to beat faster. It's slowing down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>MS. If a lesion took out the sympathetic innervation of her heart, it'd explain the bradycardia and the blinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But not the vitamin deficiency or the ectopic pregnancy. House would want a unifying theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>House is gone, and so are those symptoms. MS explains everything that’s wrong with her right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Start her on interferon for MS.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not at all. You mind if I leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I told you not to take that case specifically so you could deal with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the two ended up dovetailing rather nicely, don't you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is this how you show your friendship? By bludgeoning him with guilt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he's my friend, I know what works on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I can't let you walk away from a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then fire me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're willing to risk your career, but you're not willing to say you're sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told him I'm sorry. He didn't believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, make him believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don't want to believe it  Because if you tell Wilson how you actually feel about him, about what happened to Amber, about your part in what happened, and he walks out the door anyway… If you make yourself vulnerable for once in your nerve-deadening, emotionally obliterating...  You're doing the same thing he is. You're running away. Only he's not killing anyone in the process.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're desperate to do this without him. You're not trying to cure her. You're trying to prove —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's a hematoma. A harmless pocket of blood, which is why Chase ignored it during the surgery.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Because... life is short. I mean, yours could've ended in that surgery. You'd have never lived for yourself. What kind of feminist…? We can have anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>No, we can’t. We can aspire to anything. But we don't get it just because we want it. I would rather spend my life close to the birds than waste it wishing I had wings.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then do it. But don't think it’s the right choice, because... There isn't one.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not a ganglioma. The problem wasn’t the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Abnormally deposited proteins. It's amyloidosis. That would explain the blinking and the low heart rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Only way to treat amyloidosis is to treat whatever’s causing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not as if a lot of things cause amyloid. Rheumatoid arthritis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Familial Mediterranean fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Well, we can't all be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But you can all be wrong. The patient's joints don't hurt, abdominal pain went away when the fetus did, and no palpable lymph nodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Got anything constructive to say? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry. Sorry.  Um, she has lots and lots of palpable lymph nodes, joint and abdominal pain. She'll be better by dinnertime.  If we don't find the cause of the amyloidosis, we never get her off that wire, she never walks out of this hospital.  But hey, who needs House, hmm? So glad we lost those training wheels.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want me to make the call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There seems to be some disagreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And this isn't just a pretext to pressure me into staying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Does it look like a pretext?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. She really is dying, isn't she? Inflammation, enlarged nuclei, some mitotic activity. It could be lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are no palpable lymph nodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It makes it less likely, but it doesn't rule it out. I'm an oncologist. I see cancer. Show it to an immunologist, they'll see autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I already showed it to an immunologist. We'll start her on chemo.  You should leave. House doesn't want to lose his sidekick. Cuddy doesn't want to lose her check on House. No one's talking about what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not that I want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Want to, need to. If there's any chance that being away from here will make your life even a little bit easier, do it. That's what everyone else here would do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't expect anything to change too fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Lymphoma was your idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sometimes just knowing you’re being treated helps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>You've given me18 different treatments. This is the first one that made me feel better. I don't think it’s psychological. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten angry at you. Your choices are your choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>You're not like me. Maybe you have wings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I have Huntington’s Chorea. Dozen years or so, my nervous system, my cognitive skills, even my emotional balance... they'll all start to fray. I won't be able to fly. I won't be able to walk. I won't be able to breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>And you want to make sure your life matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I don't want to just... be tightening bolts and following instructions. I want something... to be different because of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I am. Not just 'cause you saved my life. I'm applying for a job at a foundation, running the finance division. And I don't know if I'm gonna get it, but if I don’t... There are other foundations.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's almost 4:00. Soap time.  Nurses' remote. Works in the doctors' lounge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why do you think Wilson’s leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many times do I have to use the word "idiot"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And that's a good enough answer for you? Whenever anyone does anything out of the norm, you have to tell them what screwed-up process is really at work in their head. That is why I locked the two of you in a room. So you would say something stupid and insensitive, and maybe with a little bit of truth. But you didn’t. So I can only assume that you don’t want to know the reason. You're afraid to know.  You're not listening to me, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try it sometime. You'll see why.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You look 37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I am 37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You looked 27 last week. Unless I blacked out for ten years. Your skin —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's got lymphoma. The chemo's probably —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop the chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's getting better. Bradycardia's improving. We didn't need —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She have bruising? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She was pounding her legs during the hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Hey, don't — no, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My bad. Thought no meant yes. Those aren't bruises. They're mycobacterial lesions. She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy. Must have caught it on one of her overseas estrogen tours. Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria, she feels a little better. Wipes out most of her immune system, she gets a whole lot worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Leprosy? Like where my limbs fall off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, this is the flattering one. It's also known as "pretty leprosy." It doesn't disfigure, it makes your skin look younger, smoother. Don't let the girls hear. They'll all want to lick your face. Unless you're that kind of feminist.  Blast her with antibiotics and prednisone. She'll be fine.  Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's happy you’re gonna be fine. But she'd be happier if you were gonna be fine five minutes ago.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Tests confirmed Dr. House's diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When you got pregnant, the physical stress triggered nodosum leprosum. A common complication of leprosy. Inflamed the nerves to your heart. Made it hard to absorb vitamins, scarred your fallopian tubes. It explains everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>Better prescribe me some skin cream too, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You might want it for those job interviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I'm going back on the road with Patty. My replacement flamed out. She says I can manage some projects on my own, carve out more of a role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Do you really think she can change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>I don't know. The truth is, I’m not sure I —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You can change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Lou</speaker><content>No. I'm not sure I want her to change. She's reasonable. She's just another employer, then I'm just... another employee. In a weird way, I matter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like you better now that you're dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You took a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's going back to work for that idiot. It's pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You thought something would change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She almost died because of that job. Yeah, I… I thought —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes everything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I know I didn't try to kill her. I know I didn't want her hurt. I know it was a freak accident. But I feel like crap, and she's dead because of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't blame you. I wanted to. I tried to. I must have reviewed Amber's case file 100 times to find a way. But it wasn't your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we're okay? I mean, I know you're not, but... Maybe I can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're not okay. Amber was never the reason I was leaving. I didn't want to tell you because… because I was trying, like I always do, to protect you. Which is the problem. You spread misery because you can't feel anything else. You manipulate people because you can't handle any kind of real relationship. And I've enabled it. For years. The games, the binges, the middle-of-the-night phone calls.  I should have been the one on the bus, not —You should have been alone on the bus. If I've learned anything from Amber, it's that I have to take care of myself. We're not friends anymore, House. I'm not sure we ever were.</content></utterance>
