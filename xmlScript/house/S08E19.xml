<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, that would have been easier. No, I followed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It didn't occur to you that that might mean I don't want you involved in my cancer treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not here as a doctor. I'm here as a towering pillar of strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Be a pillar in the parking lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. How many times have I told you I wanted to be alone and you've made yourself a pain in the ass? I owe you. My word, not a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Realizing I'm most likely going to regret this, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What — what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> My best friend has cancer. Cut me some slack. Also, spring break. I'm on vacation.  Although looking at you now, I can tell the wet t-shirt contest is probably gonna suck.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House taking time off is a bad sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> "A bad sign." You think the apocalypse is coming because House wants to be there for Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes. You're new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We got a case.  Six-year-old with a nosebleed and breathing problems. She was born with a rare mutation of AT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Emily has a unique variant on both of her ATM genes. Her disorder mimics AT, but not all of the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is Dr. Elizabeth Lawson. She's a developmental geneticist attached to JHU and an expert on the girl's condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Elizabeth Lawson. Emily Lawson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I'm here as a doctor, not a mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Nosebleeds and breathing problems are common symptoms of ataxia telangiectasia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We could just be seeing the natural progression of—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content> It's not. AT patients have a life expectancy of 20 years. Emily is only six. It's something else. I examined her lungs two days ago. They're functioning normally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It says she fell off a carousel. Head trauma—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>If the diagnosis was easy, I wouldn't need you people. I'm here because, according to Eric, you're the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We are. Have you considered Wegener's granulomatosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>It's a good fit. But she can't have X-rays. AT makes her hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. I'll get her prepped for an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She knows more about her daughter's genetic condition than any of you. She'll be an asset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or she won't, Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This isn't a request. Use her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm more interested in exactly how you plan to do that, Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And, if it hasn't shrunk enough after that, I'm dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Catching it in time would have been before it invaded the tissue around my thymus. I want the radiation and the chemo concurrently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I'm gonna get a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're done here. I'll look for a doctor with some actual balls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I agree with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I meant about the ball-less part. Explains the office. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>It was a merry-go-round. She's a kid, Liz. We were having fun. You should try it sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Fun? She's six, not you. You know she has balance issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>I know that she's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content> This is Emily's father, Simon. He was with her when the symptoms occurred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>I had her all week. She was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We could come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>No need. Patient's ready for transport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Wake up, sleepy head.  I saw it in the gift shop. I know how much you like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>They're gonna take you for an MRI now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> It means "magic really cool images."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I thought it stood for "magnetic resonance imaging."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>We've spent a lot of time in hospitals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>B-9.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hit. And I hate you.  Ugh. I'm done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I sunk your battleship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No. But I think I'm gonna puke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Now that you're sufficiently buzzed, what was the reason behind you freaking out on Kondo? Are you scared? In denial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I know you get confused any time someone thinks that you're wrong, but it's not considered freaking out for a patient to ask for a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, well, here it is. Kondo is right. You should be in radiology right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well done. You've kept your word for almost  two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Every day you wait, our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest. If you want to live, stop screwing around and do something about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good idea. I think I'll start with spending spring break on my own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How you feeling in there, Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Good, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I was only pretending to be asleep. You think that's dishonest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Uh, that's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My daughters do that too. But they know that sometimes, when it seems like mommy and daddy are fighting, it's really only because they're worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>And does your wife ever want a divorce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. Everything's fine at home. Hold still now. No more talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What do you think of her mother? She called her daughter "the patient.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If my kids were born with an expiration date, I don't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ow! Ow-ee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Where does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I want my daddy. Where's my daddy? Ow! Ow!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We were able to restore circulation to her hands and feet before any permanent damage set in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Primary Raynaud's? The cold inside the MRI room could have set it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Stress can also precipitate the condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>She's shown no evidence of cold sensitivity, and she has no problems with MRI machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>There are other kinds of stress. She heard you and your husband</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Unfortunately, she's heard a lot worse than that before. It's not stress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be secondary Raynaud's. Lupus is consistent with Emily's symptoms</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Her lymph nodes aren't enlarged, and she has shown no signs of immune activation.  It could be heavy metal poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>From what? The carousel? She was only on it for a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Simon moved into an old apartment building three weeks ago. I'm sure he has no idea what the insulation's made of, what kind of paint. He's a good father, but when it comes to Emily's health —  I'm gonna get his keys and check for environmentals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lupus is a better fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I don't mean to pull rank here, but I am her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I thought you said you were here as a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>And as a doctor, I need parental consent. See above. While I'm gone, please start her on Chelation Therapy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's the mother. So let's treat her like any other mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think we just hit the environmental mother lode. Funny she never mentioned an entire basement full of dangerous chemicals and drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You think she'd even let Emily down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah. Apparently a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You ever heard of Lex-2?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Read about it. It's an experimental aminoglycoside antibiotic. Supposedly it can override DNA errors in the ATM gene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Doesn't mean she's giving it to her daughter. Anyone studying A-T would be researching it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How? You see any lab rats down here? The only cage I see is right there. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Go away. I have a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We don't have to have sex. Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk. Me first.  You don't want a second opinion. You're already on your fifth. You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County, Foster at Johns Hopkins. And every one of them has given you the same advice. You're nuts. You don't just want chemo. You want a dose so high, there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright. Question is, why didn't you tell me? Because you knew I'd stop you. Which means you've already found someone insane enough or desperate enough to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals.  But who would be that stupid? I'm thinking that the who, is you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where exactly were you planning on killing yourself? 'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My place. I've been stockpiling equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. No! Stop.  I'm still healthy. Why not go the extreme route now when there's a better chance of surviving it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Statistically, this treatment has about the same chance of killing you as the thymoma does. But a hell of a lot faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I am not going to die slowly in a hospital bed under fluorescent lighting with people stopping by to gawk and lie about how I look. Even a small chance of that happening is too big a chance for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're an idiot. And the odds say you're gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We'll do it at my place. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The only environmental factors we think caused your daughter's illness are the ones you shot her full of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I tested the drug. This is what I did for a living for ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>She's your child, not a Guinea pig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I tested it first. On myself. And in six months, I didn't document any adverse effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A trial of one is basically irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Respiratory infections are common with AT. With Emily's mutation, they are deadly, and they get worse every year. Lex-2 won't be approved for at least the next five years. Emily, on the other hand, wouldn't have survived the winter. What was I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a reason for FDA requirements. A study at Jackson Memorial—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I know about Gaines' research. He's publishing next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Was. I just spoke to him. His team just linked the use of Lex-2 to renal failure in mice and rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She needs an ultrasound guided renal biopsy to check the damage. Hopefully it's reversible. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> To stupidity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Mm, not quite done. To muscle aches, spasms. To your joints feeling like they're being ripped out and replaced with shards of broken glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Should I be writing any of this down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your stomach fills with bile. When you vomit, it feels like someone's forcing a white-hot hammer down your esophagus, tearing your flesh. Blood's dripping down the back of your throat, choking and gagging you with the slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I am an Oncologist. I know—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you did, we wouldn't be sitting here. Day two: Your white blood cells are gone, opening up your system to attack. Your temperature skyrockets. One second, your skin feels like it's on fire. The next second, it's entombed in ice. Every pain sensor in your body is firing at the same time until agony isn't even a word or a concept — it's your only reality. You hallucinate. You dream of death. And then the race begins. Can your body claw its way back in time before the hostile organisms and parasites claim you permanently? Win, you live. Lose, you die.  Now, what are we doing here, Wilson?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidney number one looks good. Which means we'll probably take the biopsy from two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Hey, you're doing great. Brave as always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pretty cool, eh? You want to try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>My chest hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's definitely not her kidneys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Promise this'll taste just as good coming up as it did going down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If things go wrong, I just want you to know—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you're gonna say that you've always been secretly gay for me, everyone always just kind of assumed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just want you to know… that I appreciate the risk you're taking… Pumping a human being full of lethal chemicals in your living room. If I die, it probably won't go over well with your probation officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not gonna be an issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm glad at least one of us is confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not me. I've already identified a couple of spots to dump your body if this goes south.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I've always enjoyed Trinity Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does have a nice access to the lake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Muscle spasms already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. It's nothing really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good news. Takes most people two bags to get to that stage. You're way ahead of schedule.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You'll think it's stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That hasn't stopped you before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just always thought, when I got old or sick, I'd have a wife or kids to look after me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And in this scenario, are your loving wife and kids holding the life support cord, or are they thumbing through your will?  I'm in it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have everything you need right here. We both do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Painkiller. Industrial strength. Level: Awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're on vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Aahh! That is nice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her kidneys are fine. I don't think we're looking at side effects from the Lex-2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>She's prone to respiratory infection. Pneumonia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>No persistent cough, chills, or excess sweating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about a pulmonary embolism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Fits coughing up blood, but a clot. From what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bruising from when she fell off the carousel. Contusion damages a deep vein, causes a clot. A piece breaks off, travels to her lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>We need to get her on heparin now. Another embolism could cause a heart attack or a stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What's wrong? Is it Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Sort of.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>You can't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>I'm taking her to Mercy. Everything you people have done has just made her worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>You don't have the right. We have joint custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Where was my right when you were treating our daughter like a lab rat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>She'd be dead if I hadn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stop it. Your daughter deserves better than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>It's okay, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Mommy and I are just gonna talk. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You want to get some candy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We believe Emily has a clot in her lungs. If you leave now, she could die before her new doctors are even up to speed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>From her AT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>From the fall off the carousel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content> You're really gonna equate the two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>No, you were giving her two minutes of fun. I was trying to save her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>What's her best friend's name? What's the name of her favorite teacher? Why does she hate that stuffed animal you gave her? She's been having nightmares about penguins all month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What's her blood type? Rh factor? Her serum immunoglobulin levels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>I don't care. I don’t care. Those are letters and numbers. That's not her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What about the variant in her E-14 ATM intergenic promoter region? Because that's what's killing our daughter. Unless I can find a way to reactivate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Just make her better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How did you get in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>John</speaker><content>The door. Are you, like, sick or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Where's House? Where are your parents?  Oh, I know you. You live in the building, right? What's your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>John</speaker><content>You don't remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>John</speaker><content>You promised me I'd go home again, Dr. Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>John</speaker><content>You said it wasn't my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It wasn't, John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>John</speaker><content>If I didn't do nothing wrong, why did I die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I don't know.  I shouldn't have done this.  Am I dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not yet. It just feels that way. Are you okay? I mean, apart from the pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I worked six months in a research lab after med school. You get so focused. Once I didn't eat for two days. It's easy to forget what actually matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I didn't. Yeah, it sucks I got her the wrong doll, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Good news. Emily's lungs are clear. No clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>And bad news. We still don't know what's happening to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Whatever it is, there's liver involvement. Her eyes are jaundiced. Her liver's failing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We found a blockage in her hepatic vein, which is restricting blood flow to her liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Polycythemia vera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Red blood counts are normal. Could be some sort of connective tissue disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What if — what if we're just seeing the end result of her condition? She's unique. One screwed-up gene from each of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let's stick with our process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I shouldn't be here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What are we missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Advanced Lyme disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Would have seen it in the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He said advanced. We wouldn't pick it up in her blood if it's in her organs and nervous system now. It fits everything but the nosebleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>But why is it attacking now, all at once? What's changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Elizabeth has. She stopped giving Emily the Lex-2. It's an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It's what was keeping the Lyme in check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to start her on amoxicillin. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You lied. Doesn't taste better coming back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here's another one. You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's the white blood cell count?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's down to 1,000, still dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I need more morphine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're out. You've been using my personal supply of painkillers for the last eight hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have — you have enough for both of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've got enough stashed around here for a minyan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just remember they're a gift. So it's rude to keep throwing them up. Found that out with those candlesticks you got me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We think it's Lyme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I would have seen signs of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Not if the Lex-2 was keeping it in check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>We live in the city. We don't have pets. She's never even been in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yes, I have. With daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content> I should have told you, but I know how you feel about it. I grew up hunting with my dad. I wanted to share it with my daughter, at least once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>We only took pictures. You don't need to be mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Maybe we should step outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>No. We can't protect her from everything.  I assume you'll need a lumbar puncture to confirm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lost a contact?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Going to the little boy's room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're called adult diapers for a reason. Use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I did, and if you think I'm gonna let you change me—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's okay. I'm a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey! Just leave me alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. An oncologist with cancer. Of all the things that could be killing me… It's like the universe is giving me the big middle finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The universe doesn't care—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Why me? I'm always telling my patients not to torture themselves, because there's no answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sound advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It's cruel advice. They were just trying to make sense of what was happening to them, and I'm there telling them not to bother? I should have spent my life being more like you. Should have been a manipulative, self-centered, narcissistic ass, who brought misery to everything and everyone in his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'd still have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah! But at least I'd feel like I deserved it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Do you think my parents will get back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't know. I'm sure they love each other, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>They only fight about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>That's because they care so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So maybe when I die, they'll get back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Emily, what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I can't move my arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just keep your arms up for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>What's happening to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's having a stroke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's tanking. White blood count's</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't have the equipment or the meds to handle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. Win or lose. Win or lose. That was the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That was the deal when there was an "or". You can't win this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No. No. I'd rather die here.  Not in an ambulance. Not in a hospital. Please, you can't do that to me. I can't —  House… Please. Promise me that you won't do that to me. Promise me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I promise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stroke. Blockage in her hepatic vein, coughing blood, trouble breathing, and Raynaud's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>If we hadn't already ruled it out, it sounds like textbook pulmonary embolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What mimics a clot but isn't a clot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Fungal infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Her CSF was clean. No bacterial or fungal markers. Anyone tried calling House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not picking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Or returning messages or texts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're on our own here, so just give me some theories we can use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Hematologic malignancies. AT patients are more prone to that form of cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think cancer would present and kill her in three days</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not cancer. But a tumor could act like a clot. An atrial myxoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A primary heart tumor. The swinging motion of the myxoma intermittently blocked the flow of blood through the right atrium. Inflow blockage stagnated the hepatic vein, which clotted and caused liver failure. Outflow blockage caused the Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke. Pieces of the tumor broke off and lodged in the lungs, causing Emily’s breathing problems and the coughing blood. We'll remove the tumor surgically, and hopefully the biopsy reveals it's benign.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Wow. You — you really look like crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Been fighting a cold lately. Seven to ten days for the swelling to go down. Then we rescan and schedule the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I seem to recall, I said some things to you—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You talked a lot. I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins. Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches? My leg is killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> One last favor. I'd like to actually make it to the bathroom this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So the way I felt, you feel that, what, most of the time? It really does suck being you, doesn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At least I don't have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The tumor was benign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And we were able to remove all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Does this mean I'm not sick anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content> No, honey. The tumor didn't cause your genetic condition. You're still sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>But we never let that stop us before, right? So what do you want to do when we get out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you been to the aquarium? It's pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Can we go, daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>You bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Me too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Can she come with us?</content></utterance>
