<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You blow dry your hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, did I wake you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You blow dry your hair?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Excuse me for actually caring what I look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think the word you’re looking for is obsessing. You’ve been at it for almost an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you wanted in, all you had to do is say so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want in, I want sleep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s about time you got up anyway, it’s almost 9:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This isn’t gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You. Staying here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re kicking me out? After one night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think we should try counseling first? Why d’you want to sleep on a couch, anyway? You’ve got money. At least until the divorce is finalized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’ll be out of your hair tomorrow.  What’s left of it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>It was three days ago. My throat got really dry, and my tongue felt like it was blowing up like a balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I assume somebody checked for food allergies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>The first two doctors both did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>The next one said it was a panic attack; the one after that wanted to take his tonsils out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>The last one had no idea, just referred us to Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It says the attack was proceeded by some sort of strenuous physical activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Um, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What were you doing? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Awesome, a sex fiend with a swollen tongue. Just think of all the places I can make Foreman search. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s not a sex fiend; he’s a happily married man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No such thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Testing a new caffeine delivery system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He didn’t get his beauty sleep. Wilson’s moved in and apparently has unusually loud toenails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If they’re into rape fantasies, S is on the menu as well. Neck trauma could cause vocal chord paroxysms, which could cause choking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I didn’t see any sign of trauma, and they were remarkably open. I asked about STDs and they admitted participating in a threesome a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A hundred bucks says they’re as miserable as the next couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Another guy or girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Girl. His wife’s college roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If he’s not happily married, I don’t know who could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re looking for something. If you’re happy, you’ve got nothing to look for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His wife arranged it for an anniversary present. If you ask me, if two people really trust each other, a threesome once every seven years might actually help a marriage. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I say we stop the DDX and discuss that comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ll take the bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe the first doctor was right. Food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be neurological. Progressive bulbar paralysis would explain the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, ALS would affect his facial muscles before his throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What if the problem’s not in his throat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That would be a little odd considering that’s where all his symptoms are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Says who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Since most patients can’t tell their ulna from their anus, I’m guessing this guy also doesn’t know the difference between choking and suffocating. His throat might be fine, his lungs might be messed up. Get more blood, a chest CT and a body plethysmograph. Unless, of course, you think we should be asking the patient where his anus is, first. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pull up your pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, not your prostate. Herpes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Herpes. Your turn. If it makes you feel any better, half the patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Had any sex in those 20 years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then that’s how you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bummer. Take this, once a day. Tell your wife to do the same. It’s not going to cure it, but it’ll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got any kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any of them take guitar lessons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tennis, art, acting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give this to her sensei. Oh, wait, does your wife play tennis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s what I figured. It never hurts to make sure.  For Miyagi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m gonna close the shutter now. I need you to pant, kinda like a dog.  That’s good, keep going.  Can I ask you a personal question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Uh, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The threesome, and the roleplaying… is that because things get boring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>No, we just enjoy our fantasies. Are you married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.  You can go back to taking the deep breaths now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Marriages don’t fail because couples get bored. They fail because, while they’re dating people pretend to be the person they think their partner wants and then, well, there’s only so long you can keep that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe they are that person while they’re dating, but then they change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>People thinking that their partner will change, that’s another reason marriages fail.  People don’t change. Least, not in any way that really matters.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think you’ve had enough caffeine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were right, it’s not his throat, it’s his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Plethysmograph revealed decreased lung capacity –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>-- and the CT showed lung scarring. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s definitely interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. What’s not definite is the cause. There’s no arthritis, no sarcoidosis, he’s not on any prescription meds, and he’s a wedding photographer, so I doubt he got exposed to coal dust or asbestos at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cause could be idiopathic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t be idiopathic. Idiopathic means “without a known cause.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What I meant was that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What you meant was you don’t know what the cause is, just say that and we can avoid this conversation.  No applause?  What’s his current condition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wait for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For whatever you can’t figure out to cause something else. You know it’s going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s possible the IPF could just continue to – </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>There’s something wrong with his skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Do something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Okay, stop scratching, we’ve gotta look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>I can’t. It’s just driving me crazy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’ve gotta stop scratching so we can look at it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Stop, stop, make it stop! [CGI inside of his hives, which look quite nasty.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now we’ve got something to discuss. What causes both lung scarring and the itchy, red blotches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s obviously not a reaction to medication, you haven’t given him any yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, but what besides what’s obviously not caused both the lung scarring and the splotches? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system. Either talk loud or get in here.  Same color coming out as going in – think that’s a marketing thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lupus could cause lung scarring and a rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or it could still be a food allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ve already ruled out allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did we? Where’s Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re in the men’s room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Need an allergy expert in here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This can wait two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t know that. Chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, wouldn’t explain the lung scarring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Some homeopathic studies have found a connection between food allergies and autoimmune reactions, which could cause lung inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, and some homeopathic studies have also found that ground-up spiders can cure cancer. Can I go now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs. Sklungs? Lungs, skin. Throat.  Heavy metal toxicity. It explains the lungs, the itching, the swelling in the tongue and throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought you didn’t believe there was anything wrong in his throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I never said I didn’t believe it. I just said I had good reason to doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now I have good reason to doubt those doubts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Patient’s still a little old to be chewing paint off the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nor does he drink well water, eat fish every day, or do anything else that could’ve exposed him to heavy metals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He and his wife worked a wedding in Cabo San Lucas. A lot of pottery in Mexico is contaminated with lead-based paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now aren’t you glad you joined us? Search their house, and screen his hair and blood for lead. And test for mercury and arsenic while you’re at it. Chase, find out what the resort cooks with, if they’ve repainted recently or did any plumbing repairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don’t speak Spanish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then it’ll be challenging.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good Lord, what is that smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Stuffed pepper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stuffed with what? Vomit?  I thought you were going to a hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I found an apartment. I can move in on Monday. Is that fast enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s today? Where’d you get all that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, not from your kitchen. Don’t you ever eat anything besides canned soup and peanut butter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t you ever eat anything that doesn’t look like it’s been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Try it.  It’s good, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Just better than it looks. How much beans and rice d’you think you’d have to eat from a ceramic pot painted with lead-based paint to get enough lead in your system to damage your lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are we talking a child or an adult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Adult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then I’d say a lot. You’d have to eat beans every day for months.  Now, why do you have a season pass to “The New Yankee Workshop”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a complete moron working with power tools – how much more suspenseful can you get? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was watching something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you’re about to watch something. I’m watching something. See the difference.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>If the water was contaminated, wouldn’t I be sick, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>People can metabolize toxins at different rates. We’ll test it to be sure. Have you done any recent renovations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Have any problems with bugs or rodents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Just the occasional ant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Use bug spray?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>No, I hate the smell. Luckily, both of us are pretty anal about keeping things clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, I can tell. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think ants are the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can you stop stuffing your mouth with pancakes for one second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These aren’t pancakes. These are macadamia nut pancakes. Wilson made them and they’re amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She says she doesn’t use bug spray –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Little silver dollar slices of heaven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Some ants are poisonous. Maybe –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget the 72 virgins. If I blow myself up in a crowded restaurant, I think I’m asking for a plate of these babies.  Was the ant small and red or big and black?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Big and brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Halle Berry brown or Beyonce brown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is there a difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is there a difference. Army ants could devour, dissolve, eat a cow in a matter of hours. Australian bull ants, on the other hand, are nasty little bastards, but more of a nuisance than a threat.  No surprise there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Beyonce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well then, that’s not it. How much clay did he eat at the resort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s a five-star, $400 a night place, they don’t cook with ceramic pots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tox screen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No evidence of lead, mercury or arsenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run them again. Call the resort, find some disgruntled employee to talk to. Go back to the home –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not heavy metals!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The symptoms say it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The tests say it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, who’re you gonna believe? The symptoms or the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It could also be a food allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cameron says it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If your tests can be wrong, why can’t hers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His diet hasn’t changed since he was a kid. His favorite food is corn flakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which I assume he eats with milk, one of the most common adult onset food allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start treating him for lead poisoning, it’s the most likely heavy metal. And yeah, you can test him for allergies for dairy, wheat, and legume. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>I think I need something else. This cream isn’t working.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>No, it’s not my back, it’s my feet! I think I stepped in something when I went to the bathroom. It’s on my socks, it’s burning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>What did you just scratch him with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If there was an allergic reaction it would be on his back, not on his feet.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More significantly, it’s yet another classic sign of heavy metals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And I just did yet another hair and blood test for lead and everything else he possibly could have been exposed to, they’re all negative. It’s gotta be something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lupus could cause –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Lupus progresses slower, there’d be joint pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So it’s not a typical case! We should get an ANA –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not lupus! The symptoms don’t match.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, let’s say she’s not poisoning him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s nothing more to discuss. We’ve got lung and kidney failure, neurological symptoms, and now cardiac arrest. A systemic disease with multi-organ involvement is the definition of lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Auto-immunosuppressant aren’t helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We should start him on cyclophosphamide, see if it makes a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, and interferon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Interferon isn’t an approved treatment for lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re not still thinking –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Interferon isn’t an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. But it’s pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection. We didn’t consider it because it doesn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because it doesn’t make sense! There’s no fever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he’s got no immune system, thanks to the immunosuppressant you prescribed him for lupus treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He didn’t present with a fever, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because at that point he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction, which again, thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dormant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection. Give him interferon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But if it is lupus, interferon could make it worse. Suppress his bone marrow even further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is more likely, a rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus in a patient who’s already on steroids or a team of doctors missing a post-viral reaction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We didn’t miss anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then, I’m wrong, and you shouldn’t. Give him interferon!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Intravenous interferon has been shown to be effective against some viral infections.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The increasingly rapid progression of the symptoms has caused us to reconsider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>And what if you’re wrong here, too? What if it’s not a virus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are risks with interferon, especially in a patient who’s already immunosuppressed.  Look, at this point your lungs, kidneys and heart are all failing. We really don’t have any choice. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Um, thanks.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Fine, then I’ll go to one on another floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Actually, they’re not working there, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Every bathroom in the whole hospital is out of order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Well, there, um, the water –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>I’m going to the bathroom.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She had to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told you not to let her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not, she likes that. </content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>What are you doing?  Uh, your hand is wet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, must be nervous. I got some bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The damage to your husband’s lungs is permanent. Kidney damage is reversible and with the right therapy he should regain full neurological function. Other than the fact that he’s not going to be running any marathons, he’s going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>But that’s good news, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not finished. When I was a kid, my dad was stationed at a marine base in Egypt. We were in the middle of nowhere and there was absolutely nothing for a kid to do except look for a mummy’s tomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>You didn’t want me to go to the bathroom because you wanted to tell me my husband is going to be fine and that you used to live in Egypt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn’t have a problem with you going to the bathroom. I just didn’t want you to wash your hands. I never actually did find a mummy, but I did learn a fair amount about the ancient Egyptians. For example, they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass, but if it’s mixed with gold, it turns bright purple.  Now, either your fingers are actually worth their weight in gold, or you’ve been sprinkling your husband’s cereal with gold sodium thiomalate. It’s an arthritis remedy it’s rarely used here in the US, but it’s still popular in Mexico. I’ve gotta give you props. I’ve never heard of anyone using gold before. It’s almost… poetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Heavy metal tox screen for gold was off the chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>Why would I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you were trying to kill him, I’d love to know the why behind that why. But you’re not going to tell me, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>Maria</speaker><content>You’re wrong. I love Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I never said you didn’t love him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why would somebody do that? Sit by somebody’s beside day and night, helping them, comforting them, and at the same time killing them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe he was having an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe she was having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or maybe she just gets her kicks slowly sucking the life out of a guy and watching him suffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He must have done something to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, he had it coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I didn’t say he deserved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or maybe she just got tired of being married. Didn’t want to admit to family and friends that the marriage that everyone thought was perfect wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Shouldn’t one of us stay with her? If she tries to run –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, Cameron, go back there. Well, it would be weird if we were all in the ladies’ room. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>Message</speaker><content>Hi, this is Blake Hansen, calling for Dr. Wilson. Uh, I got a better offer for the apartment. Now, I know I offered it to you already, so if you match the offer you can still have the place. Make sure you call me first thing in the morning and let me know. Otherwise, well, you’ve got my number. </content></utterance>
