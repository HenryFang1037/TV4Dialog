<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If he had four out of twenty possible symptoms, he'd be a garden-variety druggie. Twenty out of twenty, there's an underlying disease.  Run your tests.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's insane to treat based on a game.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope, if we're wrong, it'll come pretty fast. The long view is the one where we pick the best team. That way we can use all the bags we save for grocery shopping.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You don't seem that upset by it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Diagnosed a guy with adenocarcinoma three months ago. Told him he had six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So now you've got to tell him that he's way behind on his Christmas shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>He didn't get worse. I re-checked everything. Biopsy was a false positive. Harmless lesions caused by talc inhalation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Medical clemency. Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Why would you use that word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Because I'm interested. When I'm interested, I describe the things that make me interested as interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Most people would say "good", possibly "great". Why aren't you able to just enjoy… ?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I really don't need the consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Apparently not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Mr. McKenna, I can't believe I'm able to say this, but… you're cancer-free. The biopsy looked like adenocarcinoma, But it wasn't. Harmless lesions on your lungs. You're fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> No, it's-it's… I know this must come as a shock, but I've double-checked the labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You can still use those if you're alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>I, uh, I would have thought the living would mean more than the expenses.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>I'll do an open-lung biopsy instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> The patient snuck a cigarette.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>So you paged Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Didn't see that I had much choice.  He has schistocytes in his blood smear. Which means the DIC's causing clotting. What's causing the DIC?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Drug impurities.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> Probably because they were in the second drawer in a manila envelope under a book, and you put them on top of my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You usually keep your checkbook at home. It's your go-to excuse for why you can't lend me money. You're gonna pay the guy</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>"Thirteen" thought it was bacterial meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It was a harmless test. The patient's welfare still counts for something, doesn't it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>JIMMY QUIDD</speaker><content> Oh, well, sure, 'cause I don't play your kind of music, it's not music, right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You have three choices in this life. Be good, get good or give up. You've gone for column "D". Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Simple answer is, if you don't try, you can't fail.  Are you really that simple?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>JIMMY QUIDD</speaker><content>Look, you know, some people… They like my music. Most people can't stand it. But they just sort of just shrug and ignore me. But a few, they feel like they have to tell me… what I'm screwing up. You know, what I'm wasting. Why do they care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You have some peculiar masses near your heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>JIMMY QUIDD</speaker><content>Peculiar how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, unlike your music, they elicit some emotional response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>That's odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>JIMMY QUIDD</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You care if I appreciate your music, but you don't care if you live or die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Maybe the answer is that simple.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hey, for point and shoot, I thought I did okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>It's fuzzy because he was still shaking 'cause he was coming down from the heroin.  Where is everybody else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The clinic's been quarantined. A patient came in with avian-flu-like symptoms. And fifty extra dollars in spending money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Can you do this echo again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Okay, minus five for ingratitude! No "Thank you, Dr. House". No "Here's a bottle of codeine for your troubles, Dr. House". Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I was asking if you could do it again after giving him a sedative to keep him still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I could. We'd definitely get the answer. But since the opiates would decrease his respiratory drive, and he already can barely breathe, minus ten for asking me to kill the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>What if it's a congenital defect? An anomalous vessel on his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You know that the heart does the blood stuff, right? And the lungs do the breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>If the vessel wrapped around his trachea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>MRA. See if you can get a clear picture of that vessel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You said the picture sucked because the patient was shaking. MRA will be worse.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You were doing better before you had a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>How can we see it if we don't take a picture?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>His respiratory status is through the floor. If there's a vessel and we don't remove it fast, best case, he's on a ventilator for life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>And I'm trying to teach you that everyone is out for theirs. You might as well keep yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>And lend it to you? You have to control everything. How come you're going around asking everyone who you should fire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm asking for input! I thought you would have admired the humility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You like games because you can control them.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You think you can cure pain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content> You think you can avoid pain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You think you're responsible for every failure, every… patient's boring life, every friend's screwed-up… !</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You don't want to face it any more than my patient does! Dying's easy. Living's hard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>That can't possibly be as poignant as it sounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Uh, still can't find the drug source, but I don't think that's the problem. The dimercaprol isn't working.  And Quidd volunteers at a home for abandoned kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Why are you telling me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Because his bass player told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Is it medically relevant?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It's only a joke if you come up with the answer. It's not really funny if you don't. "Thirteen" and Kutner, you're fired too. Foreman…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>He's a druggie. I was never sure there was a disease in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So all we know is that he's dying.  Who wants to tell the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine. We'll get some kid to go talk to him. It's the only people he gets along with anyway.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You could have just told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I want you to feel guilty.  She thinks the patient's a loser.  She thinks the patient's a winner. Just a regular guy with a regular problem.  He thinks he's gonna be great once he's all growed up.  And he thinks… what did you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Right. Less interesting, but just as important.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You're all wrong. My mom always said that two wrongs don't make a right. She never said anything about four wrongs. I always found that suspicious.  Plain old measles.  Constant exposure from hanging out with Oliver Twist and his lot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Patient's immune system was shredded with years of drugs. They're early markers of rash and fever. Would have been lost in a druggie. His immune system overreacted. That's why his body went haywire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>That's clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You're not doing a biopsy without neurological symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If I'm right, the virus is in his brain. Wrong course of treatment could be his last course.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It's not as commonly used, but sound can be just as big an irritant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Now remind me of your influences here. 'Cause I'm gonna say, Thelonious Monk and the sound a trash compactor makes when you crawl inside it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You were wrong.  Twenty years ago,  this was recorded by Jim Moskowitz. Who later became known as Jimmy Quidd. Loves kids, apparently has a heart, perhaps even a soul. If you're gonna work for me, you have to be willing to be wrong, willing to lose. 'Cause you just did.  You're fired.</content></utterance>
