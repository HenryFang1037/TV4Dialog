<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> What the hell happened? We got to get you to a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>No, you're a doctor. Just stitch me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's more complicated than that. We need to check for—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>The cops will be waiting for me at the hospital. They're gonna bust me back inside just for being with felons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You stay here, they bust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I can't go back, Remy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Neither can I. God forbid you die, I'm up for manslaughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I'll find someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You leave, you bleed out. You're gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Promise me, you won't take me to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I promise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at how much fun she's having.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>That's because he has two functioning legs, capable of supporting her body weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You told me most of your muscle was cut out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was going for the sympathy discount. Been taking some experimental medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah, I got a lot of clients on experimental medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want proof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? Now, even if those implants were made of adamantium, I'd still be able to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry. Cramp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I'm sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm not gonna be needing your services tonight after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Aaah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Bowel's intact. Inferior vena cava's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Aah! Aah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Liver got nicked, but it feels clotted off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't see any other signs of internal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>So I'm okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Define okay. And just because I don't see bleeding doesn't mean it's not there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>105 over palp. I'm gonna check your pressure every two minutes. If you dip below 90, it means it is there and we have a problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content> I should get to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wait. Ruby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>We'll talk more in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>Good night, Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You two breaking up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's pregnant.  I need a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>There was a raid. Andre needed to do something to slow the cops down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He stabbed you as a distraction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Didn't work. Cops called an ambulance, left me lying there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Give me crap. I know what I told you about him, but it's not his fault I started using again. It's mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>According to this, you're dead. You have no blood pressure. Barely have a pulse. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Am I dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're talking and alert, so your brain is getting blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Pulse in your right arm is fine. So is your B.P.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Are you busy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm about to go out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Great. Uh, can you do me a huge favor? I need you to go to the hospital and check out a portable ultrasound machine for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who's the father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I have a leak in my bathroom, and my guy won't come take a look at it till tomorrow morning, and an emergency plumber's 200 bucks an hour.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Riggin. Figures you'd be wrapping up the trial by now. I just wanted to give you a hearty mazel tov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you mean? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any indication the rats were getting sick?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>One portable ultrasound, extra pepperoni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Thank you so much. I might be late tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your socks are dry. And, unfortunately, so is your shirt, which means you either just changed to greet me, or you need this for something medical. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I am a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's my friend. I was in prison.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You killed your own brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes. It was awful and devastating, but it wasn't murder. He was sick and he wanted to die, and I promised I would help. Now please stop pacing and help me find this thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you talked to anybody about it? I mean, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, I may have an aortic arch aneurysm. Oh, wait, that's her. Either help me or leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Having trouble getting a clear look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Try a long axis view from the suprasternal notch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Wait! Put on some gloves. She's got Hep-C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wonderful.  Take it you two were cell mates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She saved me. There's a culture in prison. If you don't have someone to show you how to get the stuff you need and stay away from the stuff you don't, you're screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her fingers are turning blue.  Can you move those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>My arm's starting to go numb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Arch of aorta's clear. This can't be an aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe the wound threw a clot. Check axillary arteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stop.  Right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>5 centimeter gooey mass. Not a clot. Maybe a lipoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fat-filled sack. Probably aggravated by the stab wound.  You got any syringes in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Give me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I was stabbed in my gut, not in my arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You lost a lot of blood, gave the lipoma room to swell. It's compressing the arteries in your arm, blocking your blood flow. Maybe we can suck some of it out. You'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Little pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's not a lipoma.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't know why she's even considering having my kid. She barely knows me. All she knows is I'm a short, balding guy. It doesn't even make evolutionary sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want her to keep it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>'Cause you'd make a crappy dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I said, "no."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're too selfish. That's why you cheated on your wife, why your marriage fell apart—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>dude, I said—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know you. The only reason you're sitting in a strip club, ignoring the strip club, is because you actually are considering it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Although without crappy dads in the world…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Try moving your fingers again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Good. Means it's almost drained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Not good enough. We don't know if it's gonna come back. We don't even know what it is — drugs, viruses, toxins from that crack house and God knows where else she's been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If this were caused by the drugs, she'd have kidney failure, cardiac involvement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about her Hep-C? Could have fried her liver. Loses its synthetic function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then her entire body would be swelling, not just her arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That leaves us with toxins.  Where exactly were you when you were attacked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're not doing a home search in a crack den, that's insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Apparently, we don't have much of a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's a crime scene, and it's not toxins or viruses or anything else you mentioned, because it's not a coincidence. Her symptoms have to be related to the stabbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What if her body used up all the clotting factors dealing with the stab wound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Explains the bloody mass. But if you're right, she could start bleeding anywhere, like in her brain or in her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>One of those things could start growing in my brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's time to get you to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Oh, no.  Remy, you promised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> All we'll do at the hospital is stick her in a patient bed and give her IV clotting factor. We can do that right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We could also embalm her right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'll call the drugs in. You go pick them up. If I'm right, she'll be fine. Look, I know you don't know her and you don't care about her, but I do. Please.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Lie down, elevate your shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You said Andre wasn't responsible for the drugs. What is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes, you do. What happened to you? If you don't deal with the real problem—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I came here because you're a doctor… not a shrink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah! Ugh! Ugh!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>Your lap is vibrating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh, sorry.  Uh, it's my boss.  Probably drunk. Wants a ride home. He can take a cab. Do you have any kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>Why? You like moms? I could be your mommy. Spank your little ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mmm, uh, no. I – what would you do if you got pregnant? Not by me… at all, but by some hypothetical guy who didn't want to keep the hypothetical kid. What would be the least awful way for him to tell you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>Don't talk. Just let mama dance for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Should I send flowers? Maybe write the clinic appointment on the little card? Surprise! I hate myself.  There's just no good way to— How long have you had this mole? It's asymmetrical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content> No touching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry. Have you been to see a dermatologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>Bobby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Oh, uh… I wasn't touching her. I was just — oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content> No.  No, please don't. Please, please… put the gun down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content> Put it down on the ground and get away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dee, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Why aren't you in your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Brownbeard the pirate on the TV</speaker><content>Jibber me jabbers. I'll give ye splinters in yer arse, ye mangy bilge rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What are you watching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>TV, you bloody scallywag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Mo-om!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Someone better be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She hallucinated. I need you to go back out.  I just called in more clotting factor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So she's bleeding in her brain now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We double up the dose, she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. We bring her to the hospital, we do a CT scan to locate the bleed, drill a burr hole in her skull, and maybe she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can drill a burr hole here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're not just risking our careers here. You could go back to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I made a promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You made a promise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I will not take her to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Great. Then I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm gonna move you, and then I'm gonna pick your friend up, carry her down to my car, take her to the hospital, and try to save her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's staying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's going to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sweetie… go wait for mommy by the couch, okay? Go on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I tried calling everyone else. You were the last one on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Any reason why 911 wasn't on the list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right.  Are you suicidal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm not attempting bypass surgery. The tumors are small and they're close to the surface. I thought it'd be like… removing a wart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You couldn't wait till morning; bring your CT scans to an actual surgeon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Surgeons are idiots. They'd just hack away at the muscle until they get worn out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or you're just ashamed you've been injecting a drug that hasn't even gone through safety trials. It's never even been in the human body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got one of the tumors. The second one is close.  You can use the CT to help you find the third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I'm taking you to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just–just excise the tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-40"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Absolutely not!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Elevate her head more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Don't bother. Cops are gonna be waiting at the front door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll go in first. I'll find a patient on life support just waiting to die. We'll use their name on all your tests. No one will ever know you're there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What happened to your leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was trying to make it better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He was being reckless. Sit back, honey.  This isn't about making your leg better. It's about making your life better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here we go. Wish I had called 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why else would you risk your life doing something so stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you know, I've had a lot of setbacks lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don't blame our breakup for this. You're not unhappy because of me. You're just unhappy. Unhappy people do reckless things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Darrien!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content> Stop screaming. My head hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I need you to stay awake. Talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When you were screaming in my room, what did you think you saw? You said, "put it down on the ground and get away."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sounds like a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Old habits, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You were a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Back when I was a decent person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How do I not know this? You knew everything—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>Not a good resume when you're trying to survive in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So who were you talking to in my bedroom? Why did you keep apologizing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>'Cause I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I killed a kid. He was 19. I went in first. Saw him going for his gun. I tried to talk him down, but…  They told me I was a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So that's when you started using drugs? I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Darrien? Darrien!  She lost consciousness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are no cars coming. Just go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She on any medication… besides crack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She was taking Interferon in prison, so I'm guessing she's had Hep-C for at least ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can I guess stuff too? 'Cause that's gonna make the diagnosis really easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Prison infirmary isn't known for stellar record keeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And we can't exactly ask the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that would have been pre-coma. But how could you have known that it would affect her that way?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>House? House, you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell me more about the patient. What was she doing before prison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She was a cop. Shot a kid in self defense, never got over the guilt, started taking drugs, and got busted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way to bury the lead. How long ago was the shooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm not sure. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again, you assumed she's had Hep-C for ten years. Find out when she shot the kid, you'll find out when she started taking drugs, and when she actually contracted the Hep-C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And you think this is relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Oh, I got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Darrien must have had a different last name then. She must have been married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>2008? Is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We never actually talked about how long she'd been in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House was right. She could have only had her Hep-C for a few years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There's no way the prison would have prescribed Interferon unless the lab showed her Hep-C to be chronic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> So what makes new Hep-C look like old Hep-C?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What if she got a parasite? The Hep-C made her susceptible and the parasite sped up the liver damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Entamoeba. If they were in a parasitoma, the stab wound could have freed them, sent them coursing through her bloodstream, wreaking havoc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>A single bag of Metronidazole. If we're right, she could wake up from the coma in a few hours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Darrien</speaker><content>I told you I couldn't go back. I shouldn't have trusted you. I never liked you. I killed time with you 'cause I was locked in a cage. You were a distraction. Someone to talk to so I didn't have to think about… everything else.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just hear me out. Back when I still had my practice, this patient came in, 50-year-old guy, wanted a tummy tuck. But when we do some prelim work, we discover that his stomach is filled with cancer. So instead of telling him that he's gonna look great at the beach, I got to tell him that he's dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>Were you at a strip club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Please. The weird part was I was more upset about the whole thing than he was. He actually had to calm me down. Said he had great kids, raised them right, knew that because of them, he was leaving the world a better place.  I thought I might die last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>At a strip club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes, I was at a strip club. And while it was happening, I kept thinking about that patient and how I wish I was like him. I want to have this baby.</content></utterance>
