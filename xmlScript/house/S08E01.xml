<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Delaire</speaker><content>Given good…  …ish behavior and 8 of 12 months time served, we have the discretion to grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now.  Are you sorry about what you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Delaire</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that's the correct answer, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Female Case Worker</speaker><content>Are you trying to annoy us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Female Case Worker</speaker><content>We need you to show us remorse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that how our system works? Release the best actors? I shudder to think what that world would be like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Female Case Worker</speaker><content>You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house and then fled the country for three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Female Case Worker</speaker><content>They could've moved back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Delaire</speaker><content>Shut up. We got an order to reduce overcrowding. But let me be clear — you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't even remember, you can park your ass here for four more months. So forget being sorry. Can you stay out of trouble for five days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Hseuh</speaker><content>Gather for meds! Asofa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Why you keep helping him out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Hseuh</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Hseuh</speaker><content>Mendelson!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's on 80 mg of Propranolol. That's 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Hostetter</speaker><content> You're right. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>No worries. I like my nurses naughty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> Hey, House. Check out our new brand, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You really got a thing for swastikas… Mendelson. Like an ironic thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> It's a German name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So’s "House." I'm Jewish.  Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Knight to King's Bishop three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Queen to King's Bishop seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Hey. You're House, right? I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what's weirder? It’s how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it. Although, to be fair, I am large.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, Rollo. I realize this is probably a rhetorical question — Why are you stealing my stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content> Hey, House. I heard you're on short time. You won't need this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You heard about my parole, but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna. Put it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content>Nuh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds and who’s carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content>Yeah, like you losing your parole. And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers. So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>You wanna get back at these guys? Get out alive on Friday.  All right, now go to work, House.  Oh, and that was Checkmate, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>I heard you're on that short time, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you like tuna, you're a little late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>I want your stereo and your headphones.  It can wait till you finish your work.  Drop it off in my cell. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>99.9. I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Good catch. I might've missed that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not gonorrhea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I didn't say it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fever, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>So you're saying I got the clap? I've only been in here one week. My girlfriend's clean. I ain't got a girlfriend in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How do you know about ceftriaxone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>House used to be a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not going back. And that look of shock is elitist and offensive. Doctors can be degenerates. This is America.  There's subtle eyebrow loss. It's lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>He's got a point, but I'll let you make the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Usually"? Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.  You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Not usually.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>You don't wanna mess with Stomper. He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Y-you're missing my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz. He barely said a couple of words and set the boy off.  Oh, no. I know that look.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, Stomper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>Where's my stereo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I brought it to your cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>It ain't there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was just getting to that part. Rollo followed me in and took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>No way Rollo'd diss me like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content>But what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, he was all, you know, "I can take Stomper." And I was all, "how come?" And he was all, "'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month." In fact, he actually called you "Stompee," with an "ee." I think his gist was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content> You took my stereo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content> Get out of my house, Stomper. I ain't got no stereo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content> Well, then what's this, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content> What? I didn't put that there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Stomper</speaker><content> You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rollo</speaker><content> What? I didn't do anything! Next time I will take your stereo! Ow!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>That was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is that, like, a synonym for "clever"? By the time they get out of solitary, I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>You have four days left. How many more tricks do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Asofa</speaker><content>Don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This another pet? 'Cause it's gonna end badly. Again. Remember we talked about this? At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily.  I think it was eerily. "Eerily" felt like the best-case scenario.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Oh, now you wanna help me. 'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears. Now, let's get this over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Yeah.  That's Nicole. She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job. Her mom hates me, so she can't visit, she ain't accepting my calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>You don't believe me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Belief implies a level of giving a crap that I am never gonna achieve. Pull down your pants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I checked you out. You were a pretty big deal. What went wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something very obvious and very boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Drug related? Forging prescriptions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone. Name should've been a giveaway. I'll send him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Why would you say any of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your shoes — different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal. Antique locket — it's unpolished gold. Not some hipster thing. It's a family heirloom, which means old money. Osler scarf — only on Fridays, which means you did your residency at Hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indicate. And your eyes — the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis. So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sullivan</speaker><content>House. He wants you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> Parole? You didn't tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't want a big, emotional scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>But you know what the rules are. On short time, tax goes up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>All of 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, Mendelson. I should be on six a day. I get four, and I give you two.  Fine. Get one in my cell after lights-out. Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that's 11 in all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>I count 20. You knew on Monday, you get out Friday. Five days. You should've told me earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They give out four a day, Max.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> You'll figure something out. You're a creative guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Oh, you could P.C. up. But then you'll get out, and unlike you… I got friends on the outside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Porter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Porter</speaker><content>Doc, what ya need? I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week. Got some new girly mags too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was thinking of something more… Vicodin-y. At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Porter</speaker><content> That's pricy, but it can be done. How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am peep-less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Porter</speaker><content>This is just you haggling, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I mean, you ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Porter</speaker><content>All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out. I'm gonna need to see some tuna. I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereo—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just get 'em to me as soon as you can.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I was trying to use the phone. I just—I just got jostled a little, that's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Who hit you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I just—I just bumped into the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Is that good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it feel good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Asofa</speaker><content>Sick. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I'm just going through a bit of withdrawal. I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Asofa</speaker><content>No.  Fix him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not lupus. He broke his arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was in a jostle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's why he'd lie to the guards. He's got no reason to lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? There are those eyes again.  How about a viral syndrome? Or MRSA? No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast. But reaction to meds could.  May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>May you what? Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?  But why don't you assume no recent meds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How long can I assume that he's been smoking? Based on his yellow fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You're thinking lung cancer. Metastatic. I'll x-ray him on Friday.  We share a traveling x-ray machine with two other clinics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm out of here on Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, how about… if he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy. Start him on blood thinners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Very interesting practice you must've run. No need for tests.  No need for proof. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> To the proof store.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>You were right about Nicole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> About me not caring? I thought so. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>It wasn't her mom. It was her. She doesn't wanna talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity.  Cancer can wait.  Hey, heading out to the yard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mind trying to find me a cricket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>The ol' swap trick? You don't think that will piss off your cellie even more when he figures it's a different bug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide I'm surprised we're alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good point.  Hey. How's it coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Porter</speaker><content>It ain't. The Confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats. They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin. Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Now try an inch to the left. Hear the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's called an acoustical shadow. It means he's got a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How did you find that without a stethoscope? I didn't even know you could do this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start the blood thinners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>So I for sure got lung cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Which apparently really bugs you.  I could do a clotting test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's… that's a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes. If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal. But if it's completely clotted, it may indicate cancer. Okay? Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Are you really leaving medicine? What are you gonna do?  You know, for someone who asks as many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics. You ever heard of dark matter? The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe… it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect. It's been theorized but no one's ever proved it exists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>So, uh, so you wanna research it? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the greatest mystery there is — the theory of everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And completely divorced from humanity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Tsk. You have a gift. There is something in this world you are undeniably great at. You can read people. You-you understand them. You gotta go back to medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Nic</speaker><content>Hey! Is this supposed to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Jiminy didn't chirp much last night. If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.  But this could also be pesticide poisoning…  Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.  See? Just so much and no more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mm…  This is where you say "thank you."  Or I say thank you for not killing me.  Thank you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Hey. The x-ray didn't show any tumors. The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.  I'm thinking — you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Ibuprofen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not gonna help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You can look at the patient file if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Any reason I shouldn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're really not good at reading people, are you? Or buildings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>People are complicated. And people change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second. But if it'll get me the file…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>If we add "clotting disorder" to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This guy's the only one with symptoms. It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>The laundry room. So maybe a solvent or detergent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can you get me an escort to gather samples?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content> Dr. Adams. Why does this man have a file?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You need to get cotton swabs—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> — but not now. I got something to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a prisoner on tier time. By definition, you have nothing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Call her family, her friends, her work. I'm gonna get through eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're moving slower. You're getting weaker. This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Look, my girl's more important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She's not your girl, you idiot. She was the girlfriend of a loser drug dealer. Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years? You think she should? There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people.  Your life outside is over. Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Get out of my house.  Get out!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where's Sykes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Off at his other clinics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. I'm gonna go through the laundry. Give me some swabs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? He yelled at you for letting me see the file? You'll get over it. A few years of therapy—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills. You obviously don't care what I did. You care that I lied to you. You feel jilted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I feel stupid. It-it doesn't even make sense. Why are you doing time? You didn't have any priors. You didn't hurt anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had a bad lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'm sorry. We can't talk about this case anymore.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I-I-I can't get all 20, but once I get out—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> Give us a minute.  Why do you think I'm on buspirone? The stress! I get the runs almost every day. Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye. So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass… it just wouldn't be good for my health. See you tomorrow.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need your help. You have any matches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>No, that's serious contraband. What are you planning to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What about a stick of gum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Sure. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm gonna need that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?  This is plan "B." </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What happened to your cheek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Fire? House, we gotta evacuate this area. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Hey. Hey, House. You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're confusing me with the clinic again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>What? You're abandoning me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As soon as you leave, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Why? What changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm just done. No you, no medicine, no fixing people. Done. Now get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your lips are swelling. Open your mouth. Did you just eat something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You allergic to anything?  Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock. Guard! Dammit. I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>House, get away from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's having an allergic reaction. He can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy. Come on, man. You know I'm a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you.  I need to be taken into protective custody.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow.  That was great. I think I really dodged a bullet there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Guard</speaker><content>You don't need P.C.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wasn't the food. It was the heat. It's mastocytosis. It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Masto's usually a skin disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Usually? It can hit any organ. Joint pain, osteopenia, and anaphylaxis,eyebrow loss… It fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>It's a possibility. I'll run some blood tests. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work. Just give him five aspirin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do understand the meaning of the word "confirm."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I'll do it. I almost died in that cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>House, you're in here because you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want. You can't, and neither can I. The A.C.L.U. would have my job, my license, maybe even my house, if I do an unauthorized experiment—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>But if-if it is masto—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>It's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, what do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>I'm not taking the risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's his risk to take. If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I think House is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're a moron and a coward. I'll do it myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Guard.  You're done here, just like every other place you've ever set foot in your life. If I ever see you in here again, I will write you up, and they will revoke your parole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Dr. House. Did you get all the Vicodin you needed?  I'm not an idiot. That fire, the bruise on your face… I talk to prisoners. I know about exit taxes. You're clearly getting squeezed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need 20.  And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We'll take care of Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can't if you're not willing to do—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Just take care of yourself. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Well done. If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're absolutely right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey!  I need backup here. Hey! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>You'd better be fast…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Come on. Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thanks for getting me to the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> Take him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Sullivan</speaker><content>I've got only two years left in my stretch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content> Take him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> C.O.! We have a little problem here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content> I need backup, I need backup! We got a big fight here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Alvarez!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Alvarez</speaker><content>Sullivan, back off!  Mendelson! You're gonna be held responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Mendelson</speaker><content>Heyyyyyy… I'm just playing solitaire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Guard</speaker><content>Hands behind your head!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You are so lucky. We got a guy in an ambulance heading to Princeton General. Another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>Hey! Sit down! Back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where's the aspirin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Oh, God. Did you get beaten up on purpose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>House, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>House, open up! This is a direct order!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it's always a direct order. Eight months. Haven't heard an indirect order in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Dr. Adams!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>They're gonna revoke your parole. They're gonna charge you with extra crimes. You'll be here six more months, minimum!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sorry. Distracted. You were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I checked your file. You didn't have a bad lawyer. You had no lawyer. You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself. Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Then why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause I have a gift.  Once you drink this, you should get an attack almost immediately. That is, if I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You just bought yourself months in solitary. Was it really worth it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just drink it! Drink it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>No! Grab the cup!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content> Hands behind your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content> What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I don't know. I-I-I was-I was scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>No!  You're fired. You're beyond fired. You're completely unhireable anywhere. You understand that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Yes. Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, just a little more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>Sykes</speaker><content>Get him out of here.</content></utterance>
