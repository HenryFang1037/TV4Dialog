<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>And I thought we were celebrating the fact that I actually graduated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I always knew you'd be able to graduate, what I didn’t know was whether I would be able to pay for it. Your mom, uh, she’d be so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>You always say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I’m so proud of you. Always was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Come on dad you going to cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content> You want to be embarrassed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Look, uh, don’t party too hard tonight, your grandmother wants a picture of you getting that sheepskin, and it’d be nice if you didn’t look completely hung-over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Ooh, no, don’t worry, I’ve had enough alcohol in the past week to last me another four years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Good. I think.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Taddy</speaker><content>Tell me something I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Ow! Ow, OW! Hey that’s not funny man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Taddy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Yeah right, you shocked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Taddy</speaker><content>With what? I got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>Yo dude, check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>All right whoever’s doing that better cut it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>What the hell's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Maybe there’s a short somewhere, the floor’s covered with beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Kid</speaker><content>No the outlets are GFIs, plus he’s got rubber-soled shoes on.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Patient experiences shock-like sensations, as well as headaches, nausea, and drowsiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Shocks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Excruciatingly painful shocks. ER docs referred him to a neurologist, who referred him to five other doctors in the last seven days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Shocks could be L'Hermitte's Sign, early symptom of MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, MRI showed no white matter lesions, and the shocks aren’t accompanied by neck flexing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s almost noon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? That must be why I’m so hungry. Who’s up for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What’s with the jacket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It keeps me warm, and cool. How does it know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're discussing your new patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Must be a boring discussion, considering that I haven’t accepted a new patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You accepted him the moment I loaned you five grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, wait, wait, when I said I’d do anything for the money, obviously I didn’t mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re going to like this. Kid’s getting shocked every few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why would you need five thousand dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bad night at poker, or great night with a hooker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke.  College student? Nitrous oxide is fun at parties. ’Cause the shocks and drinking 'til you puke every night can cause everything else. Give him some B12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Been there done that, also ruled out cancer, MS, pyridoxine toxicity, and all the popular neuropathies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Cervical spondylosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Doesn’t explain the low white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s black, I’m assuming he’s not just really dirty, but is of African descent. Which means he’d have a lower white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not this low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s a wrestler, probably uses diuretics to cut weight, can also cause low white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not this low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not this low. Tieshets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No skin lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Hose</speaker><content>Cervical herpes osteomyelitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No external outbreak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something’s missing. Find out what it is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t even know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well figure it out, find it out, and then find me, I’ll be at lunch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>No ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Lots of ideas, too many ideas, that’s why so many tests. Have you used any recreational drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>What? I’m going to get mad at you for getting stoned? Not today. Not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Um, well at Christmas, one of the guys had some Ecstasy. It was...  Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ANA is negative for lupus, again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House wants more information, not the same information done over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Find what’s missing. For all we know the kid is dying, and he’s giving us riddles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Did a more detailed history, went back three generations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His mom died in a car accident, his mom’s mom had arthritis, and his mom’s mom’s dad served in an all black tank battalion in Gapettion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fascinating. If it’s not a tumor it has to be MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wilson already ruled out </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>MRI can’t rule out MS 100% of the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>MS doesn’t explain the low white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Alcoholism does. On admission his BAC was 2.0, liver enzymes off the chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was graduation weekend. He barely drank in the weeks before that and he didn’t drink at all during his wrestling season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>IF you believe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I did a tox screen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter if she believes him or not. It’s already in the chart. We’re supposed to find out what’s missing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well this, this is perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Invite me to dinner Thursday night.  Come on we haven’t had a nice meal together since, oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yesterday when I loaned you five thousand dollars to buy a new car. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> My treat. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Two-wheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles an hour don’t really go well with crippled, irresponsible, drug addicts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually two-wheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour do not go well with healthy responsible architects who don’t know how to separate breaking and turning.  Good news is, it brings the price right down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re taking it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Forget dinner, you’re going to kill yourself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nice bike!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you. See that’s how you do it, compliments, dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What do you do with your cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he buys me dinner, he’ll find out.  Evel Knievel had the same setup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And he broke every bone in his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We went though all the imaging studies, and re-did blood cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want hand-me-downs. I want brand new stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well there’s nothing  There’s nothing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry I didn’t catch that last part!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s nothing  There's nothing else we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You checked the police report?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>On what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On his mom's car accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was 15 years ago, the kid wasn't even in the car</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight. That doesn't seem odd to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She probably got distracted changing radio stations or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's what the police thought. Of course, they didn't know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shock-like sensations</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Genetic component seems unlikely</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's interesting. Type 2 neurofibromatosis could cause the shocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You knew this was missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'd rather have dinner with your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, I would. If she were speaking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Unlike her, I could make it worth your while </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Should I drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uhh...no. And I'm not letting you in my car until I see your wallet</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>NF2. It's an inherited disease  Could cause abnormal growths in the cranial nerves. It would explain the shocks and other symptoms</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>DNA analysis will show whether your son has the specific chromosome mutation which causes the disease</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>But if it's inherited, that means someone else in our family would have it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We think your wife may have had it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>No, she never had any sort of health problems</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No odd-looking freckles? Nodules in the iris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Nothing. I mean, why would you think she was sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We think it may have been what caused her car accident</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Wait, wait... what do you mean? My mom's car was hit by a drunk driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not what the police report indicated</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Well, then you must have gotten the wrong report</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>No. They didn't.  When you started driving, I umm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Wha... you lied about how mom died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I figured if her death could somehow mean something to you--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>How's lying about it mean something?! How could you use her like that, dad? Her death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I was just trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>What else isn't true? She wasn't a teacher? You just wanted me to read?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What's that smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I don't smell...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> We're going to need a nurse</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's ok, we'll take care of it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>You didn't feel anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You feel that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But you didn't feel any of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sphincter paralysis plus shocks equals Miller Fisher syndrome</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not if you had the stool sample which was negative for botulinism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He lied to his son about how his mom died? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He was just protecting him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Manipulating him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's what parents do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They lie to us because they love us. Who's getting teary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mom's death is irrelevant. DNA revealed no NF2 markers or any other inherited disease. Apparently, she really did fall asleep at the wheel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>SO, what exactly are we talking about here? A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are we talking explosive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The haemacel was negative for blood, and I wouldn't say he actually exploded. More like... gushed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good, now we're getting somewhere </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah? Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Of course! The riddles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi mom! Look, err, I have a business dinner on Thursday night, I can't get out of it. I know, I really I wanted to see you too. Uhh, actually, can I call you back? I'm in a meeting right now. Okay, thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Who was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Angelina Jolie. I call her mom. Who thinks that's sexy?  So, explosive or gushing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She never calls you, is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great, yeah. My dad's taking her to Europe, they got a nine-hour layover in Newark on Thursday. If it's gastrointestinal...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I can't lie to my mom.  Seriously, I can't! Wilson's invited me to dinner. It'd be rude to stand up a guy who just loaned me 5 grand. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Transverse myelitis. Could cause numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction, and the shocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, we've ruled out cancer and MS, leaves infection</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If there's infection there'd be a fever</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And his blood and CSF cultures are all negative</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe the infection's gone but the memory remains</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin level and an electrophoresis</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You really think that was his mom on the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Probably. Don't know why he'd lie about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're not the least bit curious what his parents are like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sure his mom's a piece of work! Only a mother could do that much damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My bet's he was born the way he is. Probably tormented his parents, not the other way around</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah he was either a fast runner or one hell of a fighter.  Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You guys can handle the tests, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is there something important that you and House need to discuss over dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Other than the sky-rocketing interest rates on personal loans? You know this is the fourth time I've loaned him money? Not lunch money. Money money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House's parents... they have a layover in Newark Thursday evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I'm cancelling dinner</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No. Thought maybe you could just invite a few more people.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>An infectious agent's molecular structure can resemble the spinal cord's. When the immune system attacks the infection, it ends up attacking the spinal cords as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>So he has an infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Just said I don't</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If the infection is gone, it goes right on attacking because the spinal cord is still there</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Is there a treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Depends on what the original infection was.  All right, you're done. You need to lay flat after a lumbar puncture for about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>I feel like I'm going to throw up. Hey dad, can you uh, can you get me a coke please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Yeah, that usually helps</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're done</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you're nauseous </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content> No, I'm not nauseous, I just wanted him out of here</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's your dad, he's going to be around</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. It's not that it's...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He went to Jamaica with his friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No wonder he lied. Children aren't supposed to have good times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One of his friends flew them down. Carnell's dad has this thing about him accepting stuff from rich friends. Wants him to remember who he is, where he came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Making dinner plans. What's up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They seem to actually care</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pesticides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why would he come clean about the trip but lie about smoking pot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well you wouldn't necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning. He could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed to his skin on a hike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or he could have smoked it. A lot of it. And then lied about it because that's what this family does. Start him on IV of pralidoxime. 2 grams per litre and then 1 gram every eight hours until you see some improvement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You would have lied!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you have the money then why did you need the loan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't.  Just wanted to see if you could give it to me. I've been borrowing increasing amounts ever since you lent me 40 dollars a year ago. A little experiment to see where you draw the line.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What do you mean? You just said that--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I lied. I've been lying to you in increasing amounts ever since I told you you looked good unshaved, a year ago. It's a little experiment, you know, see where you draw the line </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> He is not healthy. Nausea and diarrhoea were not his only symptoms!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But not disappeared.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The little buggers need time to grow. Don't worry, our wrestling Rastafarian will be back on his feet and sneaking around behind pap's back again in no time.  Yeah.  Check it again. I'll be right there. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's the fever that Cameron was looking for</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We knew if it was myelitis there had to be an "itis". This must be the infection that set it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe the tests were wrong</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fever, no infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So he just happened to catch a bug while he was here? That's all this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He just started again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And we need to find an answer before this infection kills him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be the ideal. You  intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. You  get a cervical thoracic and lumbar T2-weighted fast spin echo MRIs, and you  track down all those Richie Riches who went to Jamaica. See if any of them have got the shocks, the trots or the hots. Hots is the... fever</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm out too. What? House is a freak! There's no virus that causes that, no DNA mutation. You're going to have one dinner with two people, sixty minutes. Most of it spent chewing and talking about the weather. Unless they say something like "do you prefer the chardonnay or the merlot? And oh, we kept Greg locked in the closet for 17 years" , you're not going to learn anything.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We understand, but they didn't have all the information that we have now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>What kind of information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Would you mind if I spoke with Carnell alone for a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Is this bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No. It's just confidential.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>You told me you had two papers to write over the break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>'Cause I didn't want to come home and work my ass off. I wanted an actual break. Don't want to break for once. I shouldn't have lied to you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, problems with this family, probably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I know the way things work, the better my job, the better my son gets treated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Braided wire, metal weights, lead canister, maybe just a lid. Probably used it as a door stop or paperweight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Why would he want to-- </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, here it comes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I gave him an early graduation gift, old plumb I found. Looks like a fishing weight. Put it on a keychain so he'd always remember where he came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I don't know. He never used it, just kept it as a good luck charm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kept it where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I don't know! Why? Why does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where are the kid's clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>In the bureau back in his regular room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You two get it to radiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The bureau. Don't open it.  You come with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The chances of radiation causing CNS symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Call the boys in the lead pyjamas. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The measurements weren't high enough to cause Central Nervous System damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It might not have caused nerve damage, but it definitely destroyed his immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And caused tumours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We don't know that. None of the MRIs showed anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mr Hall... it's not good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The piece of metal that you gave Carnell was from an industrial device used to test welds. People aren't supposed to just dump radioactive material...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>But they do.  So what now? I mean, what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Anyone who's had contact with the source will have to immediately get treatment for radiation sickness. Taddy carried it on his lap on the flight--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>So there is a treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Transfusions. And then we try to get the fluids and electrolytes balanced. Carnell... he's had much more exposure. The equivalent of about 70,000 chest X-rays. His ability to create white blood cells has been completely destroyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>That's why he... he... can't fight off this infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's going to need a bone marrow transplant. And we did a... we did another PET scan. There's a cavernous angioma within his spinal cord, it's a tumour. That's what’s been causing the shocks and CNS symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content> He has a tumour inside of his spinal cord?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. The cord is... is made of strands put together. Sort of like a kite string. The surgeon should be able to pull the strands apart and excise the tumour, but surgery on someone who is as hemopoetically compromised as your son is... it's extremely risky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content> And uh... if you don't do this surgery... I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The tumour could cause his breathing to stop. Possibly his heart as well. There's no way you could have known.  You're going to have to come with us, you need to start treatment yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>No, no no no, I can start my treatment later...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But he can't. He needs to be in a sterile isolation room to prevent further infections.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Aww, plans have been made. Wilson made 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a complicated case right now, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Well, we'll just come back when things aren't so out of control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My team is busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>You don't want to see us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mom, don't make me feel guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>No no, of course not! Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've got a patient who's probably going to die of radiation poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>So that means you can't eat? Come on, let's grab a bite in the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>I'll buy you a ruben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content> Good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I just wanted to let you know that Carnell's prepped for surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Allison Cameron. I work with your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Greg's told us all about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>New, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Just gullible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I was just making fun of my son, not of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>We're just about to go get something to eat, would you care to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don't have a lot of time with your son. Maybe another time. </content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They're talking about mom's last trip to the dentist. Grown children talking to their parents, nothing gets talked about. Trust me, you're not missing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>So, besides work, what you been up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>You always say that. Not much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's always the answer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Looks like crap, but it drives great.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's hard to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Hmm . You know he just started school when Anne died? I was a mess. Still adjusting to being a parent, much less a single parent. You know I used to put cold pancakes in his lunchbox . I mean, that was the only thing that I could make that he would eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You did ok, he's a good kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Hey. So... how is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, the surgeon has removed the tumour without damaging the spinal cord, but the infection has caused another intestinal perforation. We stopped the bleeding, but his white count keeps falling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Okay.. um... so what now? Another drug? Antibiotics? What? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sorry. The reality is, no matter what we give him, it's unlikely he's going to be able to fight off the infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was none of my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They seem perfectly pleasant don't they? They are. He was a marine pilot. She was a housewife. Married 47 years. They had one child. Mom was just like everyone else, nice enough, no great sense of humour, hates confrontation. My dad's just like you. Not the caring 'til your eyes pop out part, just the insane moral compass that won't let you lie to anybody about anything. It's a great quality for boy scouts and police witnesses. Crappy quality for a dad.</content></utterance>
