<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>Getting ready for surgery. What’s it look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>You’re operating on my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>And my fiancé.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>You’re drunk. You could kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>It’s the only way to stop my hands from shaking. I need to drink. For Anna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>What about… our baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>Our… baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Oh, my God! Are you okay?  Brock, speak to me. Oh, my God. Um. I, I, I, I think he’s really hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Technician</speaker><content> Uh, we can edit that word out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Uh, that was scary. I thought there for a second you were really –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Then you gotta be the only one in the world who did.  This is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>It was great, Evan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>No it wasn’t. It was crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>The fans are gonna love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>The fans are crap. I’m crap. This whole damn show is crap! Sorry. Not your fault.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Um. Where are you going? My apartment’s on the West Side.  Excuse me. You need to go the other way. Hey, did you hear what I said?  What the hell is going on here? What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> An autographed picture would be nice. Oh… And I’m also gonna save your life.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Conway</speaker><content>You might want to think about repositioning the crosswalk. It’s technically not a violation, but the closer they are to the entrance, the more likely they are to be used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Makes sense. I actually wasn’t expecting you until next month...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Conway</speaker><content>That’s the problem with planned visits – administrators plan for them.  The most recent New Jersey hospital accreditation requirements</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m familiar with –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Conway</speaker><content>Who was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have no idea. Shall we get started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Just let me go. I won’t press charges. Forget the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s probably true, seeing as how you have a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You’re that nut-job doctor that keeps calling my publicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I’m the nut-job head of diagnostic medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I run every day. I don’t get headaches. I’m fine. So, if you don’t mind…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I do mind. I don’t care if you die. But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna never finds out he’s the father of Marie’s baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content> Help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Help! We’re gonna need a wheelchair… here.  Look, in the last month your average line reading has slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9. You’re pausing more. Always at the same intervals – every seven to nine words. Which means you’re having trouble reading one side of the teleprompter. Which means a peripheral vision problem. Which means a tumor in your occipital lobe. Just one test. If there’s nothing wrong, I’ll take you right back home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content> Make it cab fare. I don’t want you anywhere near my house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Uh, just put it in my spot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The accreditation board is here to protect us and our patients. So, in dealing with the on-site inspector, please behave as though it wasn’t also an enormous pain in the ass.  Chase, Foreman, Cameron – up here, please. Why is House driving a limo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Don’t have to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don’t… care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wrong. Until this inspection is over, you’re back on House watch.  Current case, past cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t have a current case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I have a whole department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are you gonna fire us if we don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was just – asking for your help.  The last time I checked the ER, you had the best-kept charts in the building. The last time I checked the fourth floor janitor’s closet, I found House’s charts. He hasn’t filed anything since you left. Now, House may not care whether this hospital’s accreditation gets downgraded, but the people who sign my paychecks do. So, I repeat, current, past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t have a current case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did he tell you about the limo?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>So I just press this button every time I see a light?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It tells me where your blind spots are. So… the twins They’re gonna turn out to be yours, aren’t they.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I told you. I can’t talk about that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you want to be done with this, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content> One’s mine, one’s Julio’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew it.  Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst. You got her after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>How can you watch that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Cause it’s awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>It’s preposterous. Not one real moment since I’ve been on the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like… I can’t think of any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hospital is being inspected and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me.  I just parked a town car in an ambulance bay and, instead of ripping me one, Cuddy acted like she didn’t know me. It’s either an inspection or an aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>What’s the test say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As I suspected, you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it’s a joke. Two guys go into a bar and one has significant losses in the upper right quadrant of his visual field. And the other one says, ‘You’re gonna need an MRI to confirm the type and location of the tumor.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That readout says his vision’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes, it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You lied to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I kidnapped you. You’re surprised that I lied to you?  It just means that the symptoms are intermittent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You come near me again, I’m calling the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You kidnapped him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s sweet that I haven’t lost the ability to surprise you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you mocking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My back. My back is killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t care. Busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Amber’s damn mattress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well that sucks. Don’t buy a new one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you being sarcastic? Because we are buying one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’re buying a mattress for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. I’m faster than you right now.  It’s all about her and whatever hapless salesman wanders into her sights. She’s gonna lie, steal and trade your testes to get whatever she wants. Hold on. I just gotta do something before he dials the second ‘1.’  You’re going to end up humiliated,  holding her purse and going home to sleep on a new mattress you hate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He needs an MRI.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me one millimeter slices from the cortex down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Any particular reason you decided to sedate a patient for a procedure that’s completely painless?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, on TV. It’s Evan Greer. He’s the main stud on House’s soap. Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Increase the magnification on the occipital lobe. You watch because you like or because I like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was unemployed. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bzzt. Sorry. That’s not an answer, that’s an apology. If we’re ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Occipital, frontal and temporal lobes are clean. So’s the optic nerve. Definitely no tumors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, what should we tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See if you can talk him out of suing me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>He kidnapped me. He drugged me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Perhaps you should go out the back way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I’m not going anywhere you people tell me to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It’s just, someone of your fame, uh… I figured fans…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You’re trying to hide me. You don’t want me making a scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The hospital’s being inspected today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>And you want me doing you a favor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not us! Our Dean of Medicine. And House hates her. You’d be doing House a favor by complaining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>This hospital is staffed with lunatics and criminals. Excuse me, where’s Dr. Cuddy?  It’s my foot. What did he do to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What did House do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Nothing. I was with him the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>It’s numb. I can’t feel it.  I can’t walk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Foot numbness has a huge differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which gets a lot wider when there’s no proof he ever had a vision problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So, House was wrong about the first symptom, but the guy just happened to develop a second, unrelated symptom a few hours later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He already kidnapped and sedated a guy against his will. Makes sense he’d also do something to numb his foot so he couldn’t leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But it doesn’t make sense to include the symptom that he caused in a differential he’s so desperate to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Unless he didn’t mean to cause it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stick to the filing, sweetheart. Let the doctors do the doctoring. Either toxins or a vitamin deficiency –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m guessing when you drugged him, you didn’t catch him and ease him to the floor. He could have pinched a nerve in his ankle when he fell. You need to run an EMG test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kutner, leave the room. Wait thirty minutes, come back and tell her the test was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Is it okay if I use that time to do the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> The rest of them can help me with all this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They’re busy. Which is really annoying because I wanted to be able to say they’re busy for no other reason than to screw with you.  Research.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>So the nutjob was right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Usually is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>He said I was dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He’s wrong a lot, too. That’s why we do these tests. I bet it’s cool, you know, being the star of a hit TV show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>It’s a daytime soap. It pretty much puts me one step above dinner theater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Come on. You’re on TV every day. And who cares what the critics think. Women love soaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You get to take pride in your job. Feel good when you go home at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You’re entertaining people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Then you’ve made a strange career choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Look, I’m pandering. I want to be a part of something that inspires people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So quit. Find something inspiring and do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>It’s not that easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Just isn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>It’s my heart, doctor. It’s racing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s nothing. You’re a healthy woman, Marie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Shouldn’t you examine me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Brock</speaker><content>Why don’t you have Rico do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can’t tell me you didn’t notice that pause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>She’s never waking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah, this is a whole new experience in super high def. I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Does sound a little forced. Could be stiffening in his tongue which is a symptom of myxedema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’s not the tongue, it’s the dialog. I think I dated that nurse, though.  No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about the way he’s holding that stethoscope? His thumb and forefinger are meeting at an odd angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be demylenation from toxic exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Back it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What’s this, the AV club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s diagnostic. Everything’s under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah, excellent job so far. House, outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep watching. You’ll never guess what Rico’s got in that box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Rico doesn’t even know I’m alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have an obsession with an actor or the character he plays. I feel for you. You need to work it out. But I need you to do it when the hospital’s accreditation and my job are not on the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want the star of the hottest daytime drama on TV to die in your hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, I want you to cure him without committing any more felonies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t do my job if you’re going to tie my hands like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fifty-one weeks out of the year I let you run around like a monkey in a banana factory. All I’m asking is that you tone it for a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want that TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’re not bargaining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want something. Either you’re bargaining or you’re begging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Me keeping my job is good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, but it’s better for you. I just want us to be equally happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> EMG was negative for nerve entrapment. Means the foot’s a real symptom. Could be vitamin deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or atherosclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why is toxin a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Might not be. We’ll know after I’m finished searching his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff. Gotta go. Need a decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re not going to cut your own throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that sounds like me.  Test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins and search the home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I like the pillow top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>I like this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>Great taste. That model’s top of the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How much is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>$1,999. It’s a great price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And, what about –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>That’s too rich for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don’t know. You think…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Honey, we can’t afford that. Not with the baby on the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>Congratulations. Your first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>How about I knock a hundred bucks off. Maybe throw in free delivery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Money is really tight right now. I’m a law clerk and my husband just got laid off. He has an interview today. Wish him luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fingers crossed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We might be able to afford $1,500.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>Well, I’d have to check with my manager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Thanks. I appreciate it.  Hold this, would you? 911 from work. Better go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So am I getting the hard mattress or do I have to go to my job interview?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Whatever mattress you want. I’m fine either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You… Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Really. Just as long as I get to help you break it in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pack your manhood on ice. Maybe the hospital can reattach it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“You choose” does not mean you choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Really? Sounded like “you choose.” I suppose it’s possible she meant “House is soooo, so wrong.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a trap. It means “if you love me you’ll buy the one I want.” </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Amber doesn’t do passive-aggressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People who do aggressive don’t like to limit themselves. Could a leaky space heater cause vision problems and numbness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’d of gotten better at the hospital. It’s not a trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, look, she’s –</content></utterance>

He’s on this whole health kick right now. Fruits, nuts – did you take those from his dressing room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You’re not going to marry Brock, are you? We’ve been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And by “out” you mean…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Well, I asked him on a date last month. We went out a few times but we weren’t right for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too small or too large?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Marie</speaker><content>Is that medically relevant?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s more than just one. He can’t even remember the last time he was able to salute. It’s cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>B6 wouldn’t show up on a tox screen and we didn’t find anything at the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of his blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The impotence could be psychological. He’s depressed. Hates his job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Plasmapheresis has risks. We should have him spend the night in the sleep lab. See if he gets a reflex erection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Confirmation is for wimps and altar boys. We don’t need to wait for a reflex. If he can’t get engorged the way God intended, he can’t get engorged.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Have you ever had a job where you were miserable?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The pay was awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It was a miserable job, but you weren’t miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>So, what about you? Are you happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not particularly. Heart rate and BP are climbing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just say the word. I’ll fire Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just sign the forms. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Smart move. I was bluffing. She’s right. We should fry the thyroid before it fries him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh… I know it’s more exciting this way, but shouldn’t we confirm you’re right before destroying one of the most important glands in his body?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had to. In the name of science. I let the crap pile up and I see which team member is the most self-flagellating – breaks down, clears up the mess. Surprise was, it turned out to be you. Again.

<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I’m lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I used to be a plastic surgeon. I’d talk about my work as shallow and meaningless. Truth is, I loved every boob job, every tummy tuck. Meaning doesn’t mean that much.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Everything look too bright to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It could be the monitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It’s not the monitor. It’s the iodine. It’s everywhere. His body’s not filtering it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, your test screwed me and our patient’s kidneys. You practically poisoned him with iodine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which he could have handled easily if his kidneys were healthy. All we did was reveal a new symptom. Usually you’re all for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that’s put me off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So tell me to my face. You never hesitated before. The Board’s turned you into a coward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I did it because it was the right thing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You did it to pass an inspection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Does it matter? Kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition which means that any of his other organs could be next. We’ve already started dialysis. We need to run ANAs for autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling. Make sure we’re in compliance.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I got the one you wanted because I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>No.  You did it because that’s what you do. With all your ex-wives you did whatever they wanted because it was easier and you ended up resenting them. Don’t you dare do that to me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>I want to but… I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mmm. That’s the problem with metaphors. They need interpretation. Jumping out of a plane is stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Well, what if I’m not in a plane? What if I’m just in a place I don’t want to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s the other problem with metaphors. Yes, what if you’re actually on an ice cream truck and outside are candy and flowers and virgins. You’re on a plane! We’re all on planes. Life is dangerous and complicated and… it’s a long way down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>So you’re afraid of change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you’re afraid to change. You’d rather imagine that you can escape instead of actually try. ‘Cause if you fail, then you got nothing. So you’ll give up the chance of something real so you can hold onto hope. The thing is, hope is for sissies.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>When I get out of here, I’m not gonna be afraid anymore. I mean, how many guys get a second chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too many. Half the people I save don’t deserve a second chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Now that I’ve got mine, I’m gonna set things right. I’m gonna start by being a better father to you. And to your sister.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’ve always wanted one. I know it’s ridiculous. It’s just… There’s something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water.  No mocking? No Freudian analysis of how the waterbed is really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>An infection is rarely resistant –</content></utterance>
