<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Officer Soltes</speaker><content>So he didn't threaten you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>No fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>Sounds like a yes.  Was there any indication that something would happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah…  Every moment I spent with him. I was always waiting for something to happen. But this… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>And no idea where he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>These domestic situations, it's not uncommon to get cold feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you asking me to file charges? Just give me the paperwork. If Greg House steps foot in my hospital again, comes anywhere near me, I want him thrown in jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Female Patron</speaker><content>So… we can use any of these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Female Patron</speaker><content>And just do whatever we want to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>That's what they're there for.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. We were just getting to the good part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is there a good part? It was performance art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's Afsoun Hamidi. She's a genius. She just won the MacArthur, legally proving it. Just had a retrospective at the Tate Modern. Nobody reads The New Yorker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. But I subscribe to her patient file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House, you should relax. You had surgery this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Minor surgery, removing a drain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Put there during major surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My doctor says it's okay as long as I don't leave my hospital bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which doctor was that — Seuss or J?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Dr. Hourani wrote it in his chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm surprised he approved it. I'm more surprised you actually asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I do things like that now. I'm making some changes… like skipping ahead to minute 37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> What is that — paint thinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not gonna watch a woman get set on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Philistine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Who's the guy with the notebook who can't decide what to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her assistant. He's been instructed not to intervene. Spoiler alert — he does.  For her, it is literally heartbreaking.  Let the games begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Arrhythmia, high hematocrit, and inconsistent RR variability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You forgot about the fourth symptom — being completely crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>One man's crazy is another woman's art. Her work explores things like gender politics and self-image.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the pressing issue of shaving your entire body in public while wearing a monkey mask. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She saw her mom commit suicide and was abused by her stepdad for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Didn't say the crazy wasn't motivated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Well, she took that pain and transformed it into art. That's better than a lot of the alternatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I still vote for nuts. We should run a resting-state functional MRI to look for increased activity in the dorsal nexus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's not nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The monkey-mask-shaving medium really speaks to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What speaks to me is she's elevated being full of crap to a genuine art form and made a fortune doing it. People that pay 20 grand for one of her video stills, on the other hand, really do need their dorsal nexi checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe the paint thinner set off an allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not without bronchospasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There was a space heater next to her in the gallery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Carbon monoxide poisoning. It fits. Put her in a hyperbaric chamber.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Lisa. You're Lisa Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What's this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I'm Jerry Barrett. I recognize you from the photos. They barely do you justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> The usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I'm friends with your sister. She showed me your photos. I-I work at the bank across the street. Um, Julia's my client. She… wanted to set us up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, I-I'm afraid you have me mixed up with somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>N-no, I don't think so. I-I've seen many pictures of you several times.  That didn't sound the way I wanted—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I guess I just have one of those faces. It's nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content> Yeah, s-say hi to Lisa Cuddy when you meet her in the office you share.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, thank God. The I.C.U. isn't being attacked by giant radioactive spiders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did I text you that? That was meant for my dream journal. I wanted to return your stuff. Don't worry. I didn't go AWOL. I had my wife-maid bring it over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My sweater, a coffee mug, a half-used bottle of lotion, and a DVD of “Marley  Me.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Given your thing for Owen Wilson, I thought you might want those last two back asap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You masturbate to Owen Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I meant the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. It's a symbolic gesture. I want things to go back to the way they were before we started dating — no more bad feelings, no more issues, just work.  Thanks for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I haven't even spoken to you since you hurt yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was self-destructive. It won't happen again. I'm making changes. I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Great. The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it. If you don't understand—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think I could avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I don't want to find out you're wrong by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a big believer that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit, and pour lye on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I'm just asking you to talk about it. You owe me.  Forget about saving your life. You exposed my daughter to that obnoxious pirate cartoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bring me lunch tomorrow, and we can plumb my depths.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>I should have known the gallery wasn't ventilated enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hey, if it wasn't for you, we'd be treating her for third-degree burns, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>That was a mistake. He shouldn't have interfered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>I told you I'm sorry. I want to share your commitment, but it's hard for me sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Like when she read your love letters in the middle of the New Museum? Yes, I read The New Yorker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>That was a year ago. And we're — we're not together anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Seriously, you weren't really gonna let that guy set you on fire. He was just a plant to get the crowd going, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>If that's your interpretation, I welcome it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Afsoun believes explaining her work limits its potential. But between us, he was real and a total dick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No sane person would let themselves be burned alive for the sake of art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>My work is meant to force the audience to break with the rational and see things in a new way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine. No sane person would let themselves be burned alive to "break with the rational."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I feel…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Luca, hand me the oxygen mask behind you.  Luca!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Congratulations. It's a gestational sac. Can't see anything this early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>I know. I just figured this would help me process what's happening. There's a lot we got to figure out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We have almost eight months. You're not having doubts, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>No. Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Definitely not. Nice, cozy home for little Ruben.  It's a family name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ruby</speaker><content>It's a sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Named for my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's just House.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I swear to God, stay out of my personal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Where is the downside here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Jerry is cute. He's a senior V.P. He kite-surfs in Costa Rica every winter, and he loves his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Seasonally? Or is that just the kite-surfing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Is this about House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What? Like I secretly wish I could alter the laws of the universe, change who we are, and magically make it work out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My sarcasm indicated no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>No, your sarcasm indicated you wanted to avoid actually saying anything. Look, Lisa… all I know is you seem stuck. And I don't like seeing you like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She got worse in the hyperbaric chamber. It's not C.O. poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think we should consider infection and test the assistant. I couldn't get his attention. He was in a daze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think that's a symptom? He's in love with her. He was probably overwhelmed, couldn't decide what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's he been doing since she was admitted? Did he bring anything from the patient room to the treatment room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A few things — a handbag, flowers, stuffed elephant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does she seem like the kind of woman who needs a stuffed animal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Who are you calling?  Oh, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What are you wearing?  Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Now go address the elephant in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This is a Nanny Cam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The reason Luca couldn't decide what to do in the treatment room is the same as in the gallery. He's been told not to intervene. Congratulations. We've become her latest work of art.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It shouldn't have surprised us. All her work is based on personal traumas. She's had Luca taking notes, videotape her treatments, collect things, like sharps and bandages. It'll all go into a gallery installation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, then I guess as long as long as the exploitation is properly motivated, it's all okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ultrasound showed a cyst on her pancreas — we drained it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why are we even discussing this case? She lied to us. It's opening us up to malpractice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our practice opens us up to malpractice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How do we know she's actually sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her being sick is a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She would have let that guy set her on fire for the sake of her work. You think she's scared of a little arrhythmia? She probably huffed paint thinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She would have let him set her on fire because of the honesty of her work. Faking an illness doesn't fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thirteen's right — at least her conclusion was. Everything else was laughably wrong. If the patient induced pancreatitis and a heart attack, she'd be suicidal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Exactly. She's risking her life all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. If she wanted to be dead, she'd be dead a long time ago. Pretending to cheat death pays better than watercolors. Coxsackie B fits. But do a spiral C.T. of her biliary tree to rule out gallstones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine. I'll get the C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. I'd be happy to come with you. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're supposed to stay in bed — doctor's orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong. You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs, not her biliary tree. You want to find fibrosis and prove your "paint thinner" theory. If I don't come with, when you fail, you'll pretend you never tried. I don't really have a choice, now, do I?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Since I've seen your paycheck, I probably shouldn't.  Canned beans aren't so bad… as long as they're cooked over an oil-drum fire under a bridge with the king of the hobos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I feel dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pale, diaphoretic, tachycardic, B.P., 80 over 40. Internal bleeding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get her out of here and scope her.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The colonoscopy didn't find the bleed, so we got to look by your liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Luca, please. We need to document everything.  Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hold this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm just below the celiac artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could it be leaking into her thighs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> No swelling, no asymmetry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So where's the blood going?  Why are you looking down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>'Cause I don't like beans.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You stood me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry. Should have scheduled my patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're still playing the same petty, passive-aggressive games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got you to go all the way to the second floor of a building you work in. Boy, did I screw with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You said you were going to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check the sign. It says you got to treat me with intensive care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm expressing my anger. You should try it. Right now, let's finally have our fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All we do is fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, all you've done is pull pranks or have temper tantrums with Wilson, never me, marry mail-order prostitutes, make me go to your wedding—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dominika is a licensed aesthetician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You cut open your own leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So all this was about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don't think it was even related? House, we've never even had a conversation about our breakup. You are obviously still angry at me. And it's hurting both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow, I hadn't realized the incredible healing power of lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know one conversation isn't gonna solve everything, but it is a start.  It's a privacy curtain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It wasn't working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow in the cafeteria. You happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How many of those have you had today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know. Is "your mother" a number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient is a fraud. I found a puncture in the dorsal vein of her left foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shooting up heroin wouldn't explain—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not heroin. She was injecting herself with her own red blood cells. It caused her heart issues, and when her hematocrit evened out, we mistook it for internal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It must have been a very distinctively shaped and awfully talkative puncture for you to get all of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Browser history on her laptop helped.  She was researching blood doping among other things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was researching me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For months. This isn't about creating art in the moment. It's about you. She set you up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>We sent a uni over to his apartment and the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, he won't be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>Any ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>When you find him, you're gonna arrest him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Soltes</speaker><content>Is there some reason you think I shouldn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Knowing him, he'll be in a bar. He'll find one that matches how he feels inside. It'll be the most dark, depressing hole you can find in New Jersey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now you're just pissing me off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know she researched you. I had no idea she—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you don't know anything, then why are you talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Please don't take it out on Luca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll take it out on whoever I think will irritate you the most.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I thought you would understand someone who uses their work to deal with pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't realize that search engines could look within the soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>You're standing in front of me in a hospital gown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What the hell was the point of this? What personal trauma are you exploiting. I’m… sorry — mining for its artistic potential?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>My illness. I did the blood doping to intrigue you, but I was already ill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Wait. You're really sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Do you know what you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>So tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>If I do, there won't be any game for him, and then there won't be any art for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I don't answer those questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, there's a lot of games I could play that don't involve dealing with narcissistic, manipulative poseurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>But this is a puzzle tailor-made for you. You don't know which of my symptoms are real, which are fake, which ones I'm not even telling you about. I know that intrigues you. Do you really want to end it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want us to waste a bed on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You took an oath… an oath to be cool. At least that was the one I mumbled under my breath while everyone else was doing the boring one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Even if she is sick, which I don't believe, she also says she has a diagnosis. So it's either just a lie, or it's just a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what? I like the game. It's fun. Go get a blood culture. Check for parasites and bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is the new House — half the leg power, twice the irresponsibility?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The new House is about making my life healthier. Never said anything about yours. Go get her blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'll do it. He's going through a tough patch right now. If this is the distraction he needs to keep him in his hospital bed, I'm sure it's better than any of the alternatives. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was incredibly condescending. Did it work?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why do you keep ducking your wife's calls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ex-wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sure she just wants to congratulate you about knocking up a 22-year-old nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I haven't told her yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But you have told her you're not gonna sleep with her anymore, right?  How are you planning on letting her know? Just invite her to the bris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm trying to let her down easy. Rachel never wanted to have kids. I don't want</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. You are all about feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I've loved Rachel for 20 years. What if she never speaks to me again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's gonna find out. It better be from you. You can't cheat your way out of this one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Oh, just the nausea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>She said her back was hurting earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What's the pain level on a scale of one to ten?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How do we know we can take her word for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can't. Fun, huh?  Roll on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Grey Turner's sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're done playing. Your pancreas is releasing corrosive enzymes. It'll eat away at the surrounding organs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But you must know that. The doctor who diagnosed you would have said what will happen if you don't get treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>How many projects have we done together? You're always so worried. Have you ever gone wrong trusting me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That pancreatic cyst we drained — it's back, and she doesn't care at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think she actually is suicidal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I would, but how did she give herself the cysts? Tox screen was negative, and there's no sign of trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> There is another explanation. The reason she didn't react isn't 'cause she wants to die. It's 'cause she knows she can't do anything about it. Whatever she has is fatal.  That should narrow it down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>What are we doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Testing a theory. It's based on some stuff you can't understand, like RR variability, and some stuff you can, like the fact that she shaved her head in an art piece four months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>That was a commentary on society's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was a commentary on the fact that it was gonna fall out anyway, and she wanted to hide why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Cancer? Are–are you sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See that tumor-ish thingamajig near her "brainamabob"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content> Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you getting this? Game's over. I won. Primary CNS lymphoma with associated paraneoplastic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Is that really what it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Yes. Four months ago, I had some vision and balance problems, and New York Mercy diagnosed me. The tumor was too close to the brain stem to cut out, so they did a few rounds of radiation. But it didn't work, and they sent me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>That was around the time you broke up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>We were having a fling. It wouldn't have been fair to involve you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>I'm involved now. You just didn't want to open up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Luca, my mind was not clear then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And then you cleared it. Then you realized you could use your death to make your magnum opus. Maybe you wanted to show that no one can cheat death, even an entire team of doctors with unlimited resources. Or maybe your first doctors didn't treat you like a person — just a series of symptoms. You wanted to re-create that depersonalization. And I was the man to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>If that was what I thought, I don't any longer. You spent time with me. You took this personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I didn't. And I don't actually think your piece is about anything. I think you just figured out that you're mortal. You're just a bag of cells and waste with an expiration date. You wanted to act out. You wanted people to notice.  Maybe you even prayed for a different answer this time.  I got a title for your piece — "It Doesn't Mean Anything."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're forging my name on prescriptions again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.  What you just said implies that I stopped at some point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>20 minutes ago, I put a notice out to all local pharmacies to require verbal authorization before filling my prescriptions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have any idea how much extra work you've just given yourself? You're not gonna last a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I've been dealing with this for years. But it's over — your liver, your hearing, never mind the fact that each scrip you write is a separate felony. You will serve time, so could I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You've chosen this moment to give me crap about my Vicodin use?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You filled this three days ago. Now it's almost half gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So is my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's a month supply. The amount you're taking has nothing to do with physical pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. So maybe I am trying to numb myself a little, because I'm trying to change, trying to stop being self-destructive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you can only handle not self-destructing by being self-destructive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you want from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't know, House, but I'm worried about you. I don't know how many times I can watch you cut off pieces of yourself. Now it's the I.C.U. Next time it'll be the morgue. You're miserable. And you're angry. And I want you to actually deal with that and not just try to medicate the issue away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You know what I feel right now? I don't feel miserable or angry. I don't feel good or bad. I feel… nothing… which feels great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Moving on. In the direction of my house, where I got some more pills.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>If you're discharging yourself against doctor's orders, you've got to check that box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a doctor. So, technically—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Wouldn't it be easier if you just checked the box?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I'm going as soon as the nurse brings me something for my eczema.  I figured it was irritated by the paint thinner poured on me in the gallery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Does this mean something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not eczema. And it's not cancer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's Wegener's granulomatosis. Biopsy confirmed that what you thought was eczema was actually a swelling of the blood vessels in your skin. It also explains the pancreatitis and the mass in your brain. And it's treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>Um… what's the treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We could do steroids alone to shrink the growth in your brain, but it's much better to add another course of radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Radiation? On my brain? But it made me fuzzy last time. It was harder to work. I am still slowed down from it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it'll get worse. But, you know, dying can also do a number on your ability to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I can't do the radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>They just said it was a better treatment. It could save your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>My life's not worth anything if I can't do my art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>You have friends, people who care about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>This is my brain, my work, and my life, Luca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>You have more. This is not some great performance piece anymore. This is just crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Luca</speaker><content>I can't watch you die… not when you can save yourself.  Good-bye, Afsoun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So. Why did I ever ban alcohol from the cafeteria? Before I forget, there's a brush. Tortoise-shell handle, natural bristles — wasn't in the box. If you could look for it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like the Lindbergh baby. You dating anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We don't have to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, it's just standard lunch conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, well, if you've gone over to the "we don't talk about things" side, then I've got a pot roast in the oven. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. I haven't dated anyone since you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you know what they say — once you go gimp…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We s-should talk about your leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You think I have unresolved issues, and you are the unresolved issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes. But it's–it's — I think it's more than that. It's your life, your choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did it to fix my life. No, wait. No, I did it because I'm a deeply unhappy person.  No–no, I did it to get sympathy from you. I did it to piss you off. I did it because I'm not over you. Or I was over you, and I was moving on. I did it because I wanted to know what it's like not to be in pain. I did it because I want to feel more pain.  Whatever the reason, it was a bad reason and a bad idea. That's all that matters.  Good lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House… talk to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I already did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you just parroted back what Wilson and I've been saying to you the last few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get out of my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.  Oh, you pulled a stitch. House, please just talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You want to know how I feel?  I feel hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not your fault.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Did I make the wrong choice? Five years, through every opening, every installation, every day and every night, he was there the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Except the first time you were diagnosed. You broke up with him, and you had to go through all of that alone. Maybe that's the real reason you're doing this piece — so that this time you can have him with you. You still could.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hi. Uh, Lisa Cuddy. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry about the other day. I — there were some personal things going on in my life, and I wasn't at my best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Well, in retrospect, my approach could've come off as a little creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.  On a scale from one to creepy, you were maybe mildly unnerving.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>I changed my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Afsoun</speaker><content>Because there are more important things than—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Than what — than your brain, your abilities? It's where everything comes from — any meaning in your life, any happiness.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's already left once. He's gonna leave you again. You don't need to depend on people who are gonna let you down. If you do this, you're a pathetic hypocrite. You're saying that your whole life, all your work up until him was a pointless—</content></utterance>
