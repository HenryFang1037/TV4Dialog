<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I still say I'm a vegetarian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Well, you can say that you're an astronaut, but that doesn't make it true. A salmon is not a vegetable, Frankie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Well, apparently, eight out of ten commenters agree with you. Except for the part where you said, "I believe what I want to believe." That they found a little judgmental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content> You blogged our argument? I asked you to quit talking about me. I don't want a bunch of people that I don't know hearing stuff that's meant to be between me and you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I write about my life. And you're a big part of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>That's great. I want to be a big part of your life. But I don't want to be a big part of their lives. Take it down, erase it, delete it. Make it go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Come on, man. It's 2:00 in the morning. These walls are made out of tissue paper. I gotta be up in three hours to do a wiring job in Edison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>I'm sorry. We'll try to hold it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content> Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Frankie, what happened?  Whoa, whoa. That's not what you think. Something's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>We need a police car at 152 Haverhill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Whoa, what are you two talking about?  Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I think it's coming from my gums. </content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What are you doing tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Masturbating. I'd invite you, but people are already talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's pathetic. You divide your nights between porn and the Discovery Channel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. Playing Dance Dance Revolution is a much better choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, that was a gift from a patient, and it happens to be great exercise. I mean, who rents porn anymore? Can't you get this stuff on the Internet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can. But you can't get disc two with the director's commentary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Come out with me tonight. I'm going speed dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean you're dating on meth? Count me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You need to meet somebody. This way, you meet 20 somebodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Over a five-minute discussion of Proust? Speed dating's a meat market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Dozens of women just waiting to be hit on. Your odds of a happy ending are nearly as good as staying home and watching porn.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You plan on doing any work today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought I might do a little light doctoring in the afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> 28-year-old female sudden unexplained coagulopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be congenital thrombocytopenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Platelets look normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Patient makes money doing freelance photography. Some photographic processes produce toxic gases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's a blogger. I can't see her photos being anything but digital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does she blog? Politics? Dominatrix? Cooking? 'Cause I need recipes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's a personal journal. I don't get putting your whole life online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not that crazy. Privacy's basically a modern invention. Towns used to be too small for anybody to keep any secrets. What if it's not the platelets, but the glue that holds 'em together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. Thrombin and von Willebrand factor are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And knowing too much about each other is exactly why people leave small towns and move to the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And a lot of people choose to stay because, in return for zero privacy, you get community, connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Big red As for our tunics. Connections are for airports. For people, we have over 300 cable channels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Her photos may be digital – doesn't mean she couldn't have been exposed to some other toxin. We should search the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eeny, meeny, miny, Thirteen and Tiny. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This one's locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm surprised you took the pro-community position.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I have friends. I like people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You also like secrets. You deny it, it sort of proves my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When we're left to our own devices, we make lousy choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Ignore it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content> I can hear you in there. Open the door, or I'm calling the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> We're four stories up, but there's a fire escape on the other wall. The ledge might be wide enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're doctors. We aren't stealing anything.  We're collecting samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>The neighbor. Did they say that you could come in here and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yup. What do you know about Frankie and Taylor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not much. The guy works a lot. I see Frankie around. We argue a few times a week, and then we go back about our business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What do you argue about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Frankie's got some strong opinions. Wants to recycle every molecule of trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You take the anti-recycling position?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Trash piling up for composting's attracting every rat in the neighborhood. I had to put down poison.  It's her private drawer. What are you doing over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She said she doesn't have any secrets. I'm taking her at her word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is there any chance Frankie touched the rat poison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Touched it? She grabbed a chunk of it right out of the mouth of the schnauzer from down the hall. Now every time I put the stuff down, she picks it back up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You brought a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wilson seemed to think it was a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You need to dive back into the pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And he has to swim in ours? You go to a bar, you bring your ugly friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not a beauty pageant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Life is a beauty pageant. Little girls who kiss frogs expect them to turn into you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I'm not that good-looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You kind of are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So you attribute every relationship I've ever had to the height of my cheekbones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not the whole relationship. Just the beginning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The rest is your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Women aren't as distracted by appearances as we are. They look deeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You wanna bet?  You can't tell anyone you're a doctor. You're unemployed. You're also a little slow, misunderstand everything they say. And lose the accent. A hundred bucks says you still walk out of here with a dozen names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Hostess</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, the fun is about to start. When I strike this gong, each man should sit at the table you've been assigned. When I strike it again, date's over, move on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm an oncologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leeanne</speaker><content>Oh, my aunt and my grandma, they both died from breast cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Do-do you wanna talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a diagnostician. I find out what's wrong with people, and I fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Melodie</speaker><content>Don't all doctors do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but they can't dance like I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I play video games. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chloe</speaker><content>Oh. Professionally?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I wish, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Dionne</speaker><content>After six months of chemo, we thought he was out of the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Grace</speaker><content>I don't want kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Grace</speaker><content>I'm thinking about going from a "C" to a "D."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Quadruple check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Grace</speaker><content> And I'm on fire for the Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>I'm a chocolatier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I could tell by your hips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Yeah, I-I guess I could afford to lose a few pounds. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I don't think I know anybody who died of cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thank God. For you, I mean. Obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Except my cat.  She died a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I hate these things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, are you here at gunpoint? You need me to call 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Friend dragged me. She keeps trying to fix my life. Which, admittedly, could use it, but... still annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You like puzzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I hoped my job would let me play with puzzles all day long, but it didn't work out that way.  Police detective. Turns out criminals are idiots. If they're not gonna bother to challenge you, what's the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is there a fire alarm we could pull? Maybe get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content> Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except... Maybe you're just too swoft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Beg your pardon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Swoft. It's one of your crossword answers. I believe it means lying manipulator who tells men anything they want to hear. You brought a prop as a conversation starter. Folded the paper to make it look read, filled in some answers, but you couldn't be bothered to work at it, so you just put in random letters. You have some natural talent as a liar, but not enough brains to see it through. I'm gonna assume you're not a cop.  Are the five minutes up?</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Hostess</speaker><content>These women would welcome a call from you.  And these women would welcome a call from you.  My.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's nice to have visitors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I'm updating my blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joan</speaker><content>And I'm reading it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You realize you're in the same room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content> Sorry.  So I've been thinking about what you said. And I'm sure I washed my hands after I threw out the rat poison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Apparently you did it multiple times over a course of days. Can't be too certain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joan</speaker><content>You must be Dr. Foreman.  Got to get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joan</speaker><content>Take it easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>What? She reads my blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Personally, I don't think you're condescending at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>That's not what I wrote. When you were taking my history, I told you I went whitewater rafting six months ago, and you said,  "it was unlikely to be related." I was just giving information. Let's face it. You got a little snarky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't convey a tone of voice in writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I just put what you said. If you don't want people to think you're condescending, maybe you shouldn't say condescending things.  Can this wait a second 'cause I have to pee?  You know, I think people behave badly because there are no records of what we say or do.  And nobody believes anymore that God's watching. Well, God's not, but I am.  Everything is on the record, including everything I do.  I don't think my pee is supposed to be mud-colored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We were wrong about the rat poison.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Coagulopathy plus kidney equals what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Normal creatinine levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She has elevated cholesterol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, Wilson! Can't find my pornos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Have you tried offering a reward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Gaucher's disease. It would affect her ability to synthesize Vitamin K.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's on a semi-vegetarian diet. Means she gets plenty of Vitamin K. Sjögren's is more likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume you moved them while you were dusting. I checked the drawers, windowsill, DVD player in your room.  The quiet ones are always deeply repressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I returned them to the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She had a fish dinner a couple of nights ago. Could be Haff disease causing rhabdo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What? Why did you return them to the store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's no trouble. I had to stop next-door for my dry cleaning anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sjögren's wouldn't inhibit the clotting enzymes, infiltrate the kidneys – explains everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So does Haff disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not thanking you. I'm asking you why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because if I did happen to bring a woman home last night, I wanted it to be a porn-free zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do realize things don't have to be socks to go into a sock drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Horribly, horribly sorry. I thought you'd... watched them all. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You completely ruined my morning. I had to pull out your old family photos.  Your mom was pretty hot.  Haff disease fits the timing best. Start her on saline and Mannitol.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You reading your patient's blog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You should. Could be some clues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too many. Be like doing a whole body scan. Send us up eight blind alleys. That's why Chase is doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She mentions you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's never met me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're an unseen presence, like the Wizard of Oz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was a fraud. She couldn't have gone with Keyser Soze? Speaking of movies that don't make any sense, I stopped at the rental store to get those pornos back. I told the guy at the counter I was so grateful that you'd returned them, but I wanted them. Guess what. You only returned two. You lost the third. It's decent of you to pay for it, not let them put it on my bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know... I can explain what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure you could. But rather than listen to your lies, I thought it'd be more fun to drive all over town and get another copy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have – you have it here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, God.  Oh, God! Okay, first, that's not me. It's not – mostly not –  I was – I was in college.  I don't – my roommate was minoring in film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you hyperventilating? Remember that covering your mouth and one nostril can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's not a director. He's an artist. The way he plays with light and darkness and…  boobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Moon Woman</speaker><content>What are you? Where are you taking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> That's not me. That's not – I mean, you can see it's not me. He added extra scenes so he could release it as a porno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Be not afraid, Wilson. You took risks for your art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Oh, boy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No one – Hey, look at me – No one can know about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From this moment on, my lips are sealed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's okay. Be not afraid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Relevant? No. Interesting.  I guess. There's nothing that she doesn't share. "Angry sex is overrated. How can he expect me to be aroused when I'm so pissed at him?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Revelations like that might just earn her a new kidney. An hour after she blogged about her kidney failure, the hospital got a call from Singapore. One of Frankie's readers asking how hard it would be to donate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How good-looking am I?  I'm not asking if you're attracted to me. I'm looking for an objective answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, okay, then it's an appropriate question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Last night, I acted like a complete tosser to prove to House that women don't go out with me for my looks. Cost me a hundred bucks and my definition of myself. And women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So date men. They're not shallow at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Everything's physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes. We are physical beings. Some more than others. Please don't define my entire gender based on one night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, what if the patient's problem is a physical reaction, not an emotional one? What if her lack of arousal had nothing to do with their fight? Sjögren's would inhibit her normal secretions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry for keeping you up. I thought it better not to wait till morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Oh, it's no problem. I'm a night owl.  So you think I might have this Sjögren's 'cause of my lack of discharge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah. It's lucky you wrote about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>And a little crazy, you're thinking, to share that much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not crazy. Unusual to be so intimate with people you don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>But I do know them. They read my blog, I comment on theirs. Just 'cause you haven't met someone physically doesn't mean you don't know them. What about you? Are you in a relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It recently ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lie flat on your back all the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>But you saw each other every day, right? How much did you tell her about what you were thinking? Or did you just end up talking about where you were going to dinner and who needed to do the laundry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is that what your relationship with Taylor is like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>No. Oh, maybe a little. You know, he's-he’s great, but sometimes it's easier to open up to people who aren't looking at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You need to lie flat for us to get the x-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I'm actually not comfortable on my back. Can't we do it this way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Did you strain a muscle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>No. What's wrong?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I've booked our patient in for heart surgery. I was doing a sialogram on her, and she didn't want to lie on her back. That's a complaint you hear from people with heart valve issues. It fits. Sjögren's damaged her heart, causing her clotting problems, causing her kidneys to fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You based all that on the fact that she didn't want to lie down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, that and the cardiac echo I performed after she didn't want to lie down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Her mitral valve is nearly gone. Which means she's nearly gone.  God, you're pretty.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So we can replace the mitral valve with a pig valve or with a plastic one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>From an actual pig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's the better choice if you want to have children someday. A plastic valve requires you to be on anticoagulants, which are known to cause birth defects. On the other hand, the pig valve wears out quickly, so you'd need to have heart surgery again in ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I know that you're on the fence about having kids, but Taylor really wants them.  It's in the blog.  I'm afraid you two will need to agree on that decision earlier than planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>It's your call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content> Can you pass me my laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I want to get some feedback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>You really think that asking strangers for some off-the-top- of-their-head response is gonna be helpful here? A lot of your readers are into animal rights. They've got you two-thirds of the way to vegan. What are they gonna say about you buying your life with the life of a pig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Whatever they say, I don't have to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>It won't work out that way. And we're the ones that are gonna have to live with this. Please, Frankie. Don't tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>If I start picking and choosing, I'm being dishonest. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Though I guess I should thank whoever taught you how to please a woman.  Maybe it was the forest nymphs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Get my Vertigo poster back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Cashier</speaker><content>Be not afraid. It's exact change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm looking to get something on House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Couldn't you just ask the love nymphs for the secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't. My mission is to find something that House would not like to see made public and make it public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In. But you know him better than anyone. Why do you need my help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House would never leave anything secret around the condo. But you've worked in the same office with him, on and off, for years. Think back. Were there ever any odd phone calls or visitors from the past?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He openly brings prostitutes into the hospital, and he gambles with bookies 'cause he's too lazy to go to the OTB. And you're asking for some – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What? What?  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's reading The Golden Bowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The Gold – The – by Henry James?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah. No. No, no, he's not really reading it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. I don't – I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That book's at least 400 pages long. Whatever he's reading is only half that thick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe he's reading a version with a smaller font.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's not using his reading glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's a good point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He took the cover off The Golden Bowl and put it onto this other book so no one would know what he was reading. Whatever it is, he's ashamed of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I'm going with plastic. It just makes more sense. I don't want another operation later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>That's not why you're doing this. Look, when you were first telling me about why you love the Internet, you said that no one has to be alone again. Whoever you are, whatever you love, you can connect with someone. If you want to recreate the Boston Tea Party while dressed as imperial storm troopers, you can find the ten other people in the world that have always wanted to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>That hasn't changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>But you have. This thing that you do, it's not about connection anymore. It's about an audience. It's a performance, and you've got one eye on the number of hits. You've turned our lives into their entertainment. You're smart, you're fun to read, it's okay. But don't give them this. Or if you do, don't... expect me to be here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, it's a good cover choice. It's not like anyone would pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's Cameron's favorite book. I don't even know what it's about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't do that to yourself.  What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Giving him a computer is like giving plutonium to Dr. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Got it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Step by Step: Sermons for Everyday Life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>These are literal sermons, written by a minister. Loving thy neighbor even when thy neighbor's stereo is keeping you up at night. Why would he read this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why would he hide it? He reads the Bible, he reads the Koran. He says he likes to know what mistakes people are making.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think he's sincere? You think that he's actually getting something out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> What a hypocrite. How can we use this in a cruel yet funny way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know what?  Don't mention this to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, so what was the point?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Are you gonna be here when I wake up?  I hate that you don't have a blog. I hate that I don't know what you're thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Let's not get into it right now. We need to get you through surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I don't want to go in there knowing that you'll stick with me through surgery 'cause that's what good guys do, but once I'm better, you'll be gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Let's not get into it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>It hurts. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>Is it her heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>No, it's here.  Here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Get her inside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your appendix burst. We had to remove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And the biopsy confirms it was full of abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I have cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We've postponed putting in the new valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>So I mean, I guess we do, what, chemo and all that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, but apparently you've had this for some time. When your appendix burst, it was like a dam giving way. The cells went streaming throughout your body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>So you're saying you'll treat, but you don't expect it to work. That's why no valve. It's pointless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Our dean of medicine has approved an experimental treatment. We use your unique cancer cell signature to create a targeted lymphoma vaccine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Okay, so that'll cure me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, we're not actually sure what it'll do, but the intention is to train your immune system to recognize and kill cells bearing the same malignant signature while leaving healthy cells alone. But, as Dr. Foreman says, it's experimental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>So without it, what kind of time are we talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>An exact prognosis is impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Well, how about a guess? Something, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Based on people in situations like yours... maybe a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Taylor</speaker><content>Baby, whatever we have to do, we'll do. I can take care of you. I can work from home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content> Sounds good. Thank you for letting me know. We'll start with the treatment whenever it's ready.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is she being a good soldier, or is she in denial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Denial's not unusual for a first reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or it could be a symptom. Some lymphomas affect cognition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it is denial, she needs time to process. If it's a symptom, hopefully treatment with the vaccine will help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hey, Sandy.  Can I borrow your car? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She gave me the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're a doctor. She was doing you a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She barely knows me. I've been deluding myself that I'm actually connecting with people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The first person I ever fell in love with turned out to be a total tool. I mean, he came across all funny and charming and thoughtful, but it was an act. He saw something he wanted, and he knew he had to behave a certain way to get it. In retrospect, the fact that I was 17 and he was 30 should have been a clue. Figuring out who people are takes time. It takes twice as much time if they're trying to impress you. Now I could take from this that anyone who loans me their car has an ulterior motive, or I can accept that it's just a nice thing to do and take people as they come.  You wanna do the first injection?</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why are you reading a book by a Unitarian minister?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm serious. This–this is messed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patient wrote it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you've never treated a patient with this name. I looked it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's an assignment from my therapist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, it wasn't. No one you respect would give you this and expect it to be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a book!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of sermons. For anyone else, spiritually enlightening. For you, it's practically a psychotic break.  I know that you have trouble sometimes with the pain without the Vicodin – is that it? Are you so out of options, you're looking for answers in what you consider irrationality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm all right. Trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you all right because you're back on Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said, "trust me."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That I knew some people who could benefit spiritually from the book.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not surprised she's tired. She's always been a night owl. Just by treating her, we've completely disrupted her schedule.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Frankie</speaker><content>Well, I became a vegetarian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A lot of people misunderstand how a vegetarian diet works. You take in less unusable material, and your waste gets more efficient. Harder and rounder. Just look at the feces of rabbits. Seriously. I think I might have some… </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You'll still need a new heart valve, and you'll be on meds for a few years, but basically, yeah. Your odds are good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Faces can be distracting, but there's nothing better than looking into someone's eyes and, well, everything that goes with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't know. People meet, they like something superficial, and then they fill in the blanks with whatever they want to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why are you so hung up on this? I refuse to believe it's all because you just noticed you have a nice face. You just came off a relationship. You know things go deeper than... Is that what this is about? You and Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was the one that pursued her. Maybe I was just filling in the banks. Maybe... maybe the first reaction was right. We were just two people who were in proximity and found each other attractive, and I ne - I never should have...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You weren't looking for some big catharsis. You didn't want to hug the guy. You just wanted to know how his head works. How he thinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause I'm fascinated with how ministers think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because you're not ordinary, House. You're way out there on the fringe somewhere. I'm your best friend, and half the time, I don't understand you. You're alone. Been alone your whole life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>When you read that book, you were hoping that somewhere, underneath all that talk of God, there would be a way of thinking, a mind that you could recognize. You wanted what we all want.</content></utterance>
