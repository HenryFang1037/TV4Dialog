<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Been paging you for over two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I must've been in the shower. Then I had to moisturize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Eight-year-old boy was brought into the ER last night with acute respiratory distress.  No history of —  — no histories of asthma or allergies, and his chest X-ray's clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I had to moisturize twice. Dominika made oysters Rockefeller last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kid's been having night terrors. Woke up in the middle of one in full respiratory arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stress induced panic attack. Tell the parents to lay off the grades. The world needs fry cooks too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Does great in school. The parents are divorced, but it was amicable. And the dad's moved out of state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you seen Wilson around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The dreams are about an ugly, old hag trying to strangle him.  The family's Hmong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>SUNDS — sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome, aka BS name for “no one's figured out why they died.” Over 100 in the early '80s. Only male. Only Hmong. Healthy right up until the moment they died in their sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What was he dreaming about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It doesn't matter. It's a dream. It doesn't mean anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If the nightmare's scary enough, meaningful or not, it could cause a catecholamine surge and ventricular fibrillation. An ancient demon called a Dab was sitting on him, strangling him. I think that qualifies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Except in the rational part of the file, where it says his EKG's within normal limits. It's not his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What about obstructive sleep apnea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sleep apnea wouldn't have caused breathing problems after he woke up. What did you dream of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I never remember my dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you're certain that they're insignificant. Defensively so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I was defending science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were defensively defending science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Lung damage from inhaled toxins could keep causing problems after he woke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Or an upper respiratory infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, Chase and Park, start IV antibiotics for pneumonia. Taub and Adams, go check the home for toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Could I go with Taub? It was my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right… 'cause for a moment there, I thought you were uncomfortable around Chase because you'd had a nocturnal Australian.  You can go with whoever you want. But all of you, read all of these files.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Do you believe a spirit could be hurting your son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because if he's been taught to believe that, it is possible for the fear alone to affect heart function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content> I'm an engineer. I know illnesses aren't caused by evil spirits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I just… had to check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Anything else you need to check?</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House… we can talk later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax, I'm a doctor. Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House… House! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Later. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had sex with Dominika.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>In a dream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wasn't literally sex. Technically, it was flossing. You know, teeth, testicles. I think the symbolism is pretty clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>“Later” just changed to “never.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll tell you what would be weirder, if you didn't dream about having sex with Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. But I've dreamed about having sex with a lot of people I work with, and it didn't freak me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>That's different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>'Cause you've actually had sex with a lot of people at work, and that hasn't freaked you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Good point. So you're worried about what it means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I'm not worried. It means nothing. It means something, doesn't it? I work with him. I can't want to sleep with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe Chase just represents work. You're just falling in love with your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It has been very satisfying lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You smell that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Yeah. Smells like wet dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's mold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's not mold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's definitely mold.  I don't see any sign of water damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Holy crap.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It looked like a slaughterhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I don't know what you're talking about. It was clean when we left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're telling us some random person broke into your house to dismember a pig in your son's bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>A pig? My father-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>What you should have done weeks ago, when the dreams started. I'm saving Lue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content> He's coding! Need a doctor in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>V-tach. No pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Push 1 milligram EPI!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Paddles. Charge to 50.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Charging!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Clear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Baby…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Still V-tach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Charge to 100!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content> 100!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Clear!  Charging—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Wait! Normal sinus rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Oh, God!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's stable, but we've obviously got a second symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, kid in V-tach. Tell me about the luau in his bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's a traditional Hmong ceremony that's supposed to call back the kid's soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hasn't he heard of Star-69?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There's more. The reason grandpa thinks the kid's soul is stolen is because he's convinced his son, the kid's father, had his stolen as well. He beat his boss to death. The dad didn't move away. He's in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>PTSD could definitely cause breathing problems—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's not PTSD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Even if the kid wasn't there, just hearing what the dad did—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>But he hasn't. It happened when he was two, and all he's ever been told is that his parents divorced and his dad moved away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The heart thing indicates a malignant arrhythmia. He needs an E.P. study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many of the other files showed malignant arrhythmias?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>None, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget the E.P.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about acute pericarditis? Explains the dyspnea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many of the other files—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's exacerbated by lying supine, so the symptoms would get worse when he goes to sleep. Just like all 100 of the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do an echo to check the pericardium. See if you can find any cardioactive toxins in the home samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Can I just say that I very much enjoy my job?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, no, please. No need to apologize for your earlier behavior.  Floss was mint probably because of this green G-string she hangs up to dry in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> My watch must have stopped. Apparently it's already “never.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You might want to forward your calls. You do not want the Reader's Digest version on this. There was a very tight hygienist's uniform, suggestive use of the water sprayer—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The floss isn't sex. It's guilt. It's tying you up for throwing away the I.N.S. notification granting Dominika her citizenship.  She can move out, but she still doesn't know it, which means you're basically holding her prisoner. Tell her the truth, and leave me alone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>What? You startled me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We work together every day, usually under a fair amount of stress. It's only natural I'd pop into a subconscious thought every once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Have you ever dreamt about having sex with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You paused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, I didn't. You think I'm lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>No, I think you're fighting the urge to snap the word "no" because your subconscious finds the idea abhorrent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So if I snap, it's offensive, and if I don't snap, it's offensive for the exact same reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Talk to your subconscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is becoming weird because you're making it weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>So you don't find the idea abhorrent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I work with you. I don't have to answer that question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You just did.  What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Echo was negative, but he has severe abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Ultrasound didn't suggest any intestinal blockages, but he's severely constipated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>No spores, clostridium, or organic toxins in the kitchen samples. Nothing in the bedroom either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We need to scope him, and we're gonna need to clear his bowel first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We should biopsy his thyroid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>For an impacted bowel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hashimoto's thyroiditis would explain his lung, heart, and intestinal involvement. And if you think we still need House's approval, it also explains dying in your sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Nice call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>When you invite me for dinner, I thought maybe you take me to a restaurant. Or have plates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry. Idiot delivery guy forgot them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Mm… The idiot delivery guy, or the idiot guy whose food you stole from lounge refrigerator, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You've gotten to know me pretty well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> My citizenship depends on it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah… that's actually why I wanted to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> You heard news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>So what news? They want us to come in for another interview?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.  Since we hadn't heard anything, I–I called, and they said it's gonna be a couple weeks, maybe a month till they finalize their decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>A month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. It sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>No, it's — it's not suck to live with you. It's been fun, but… you know, I just want to be legal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you will be. Absolutely. In the meantime…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you ever shot anyone?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content>No, get away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Look, this needle isn't nearly as big as the one in your arm, and that didn't hurt, did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content>I don't want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>They need to do it, Lue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You'll only feel a little pinch as we give you the numbing medicine, and after that, you won't feel a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Lue, calm down. It's gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What's he saying? What's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>He's saying it's too late. There's nothing we can do.  It's Hmong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>He doesn't speak Hmong. He's never even heard it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>It isn't him speaking. It's the Dab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's seizing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Oh—! Oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Need some Lorazepam in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Seizure rules out Hashimoto's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, that's the issue, not that we have no rational explanation for how the patient spoke a language he's never even heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've got one. Dang tong lee twah. It means "you're a bunch of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.  Or it doesn't. But you wouldn't know because none of you speak Hmong. Kid, on the other hand, is presumably fluent in gibberish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>The grandfather speaks Hmong. He translated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He heard what he wanted to hear, 'cause if his grandson really is possessed, that means his son really is possessed, which is a giant step up from being a sledgehammering psychopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Whatever it was preceded a seizure. It's obviously a neurological symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Scleroderma, advanced to the point that it's affecting his brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So we should start treating—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting that you keep falling for it when I say “interesting.” The scleroderma part was idiotic — we'd have seen skin involvement. The interesting part is that you and Park agree, but you're not able to look at each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Um… I'm looking at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I'm looking at him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good, now lick your lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Rasmussen's encephalitis. Diffuse spotty inflammation could hit the autonomic centers of the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cha mo tie mia boo chang. It's Hmong for “get an MRI to confirm.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Rasmussen's encephalitis. But he'll be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>With treatment, it's manageable. And it explains all the things that have happened to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>You are wrong. And you are wasting my grandson's time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Neurological issues can cause a person to speak in tongues, speak with an accent—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>He wasn't speaking in tongues!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In times of stress, our senses can fool us into believing—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>I know the difference between science and faith, and when my son started having the same dreams my grandson is having, science couldn't help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sorry if your son suffered from mental illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>Kao was not crazy. He was bright, caring, happy, until the bad dreams came. I don't want to watch it happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Please don't scare the boy. It won't help him get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Axial view of mid-brain level looks good. Moving on to thalamic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I had another dream last night. This time it was about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>See, that's how you're supposed to react. When a woman tells you she's dreamt about you, you should be thrilled, even if you're not interested in her whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're an idiot, you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Well, I definitely won't be dreaming about you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm jealous of you two. You couldn't be more different, and yet you have this good thing happening. You support each other. You like each other. Don't let House screw it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We're not that different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, you are.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you're just telling your husband now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Immigration doesn't know. No need for husband to know.  What is happening to boy with demons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absence of evidence on an MRI, which my team has mistaken for evidence of absence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> This is what I am not understanding: How can you believe in dark matters but not in dark spirits? Is–is the idea of demons so different than the Higgs boson? We can't see it, but we can see the impact of its presence.  I borrowed your physics book. I read while in bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a dead-eye shot and enjoy reading quantum physics on the crapper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>I read in bathtub.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Xang</speaker><content>Your doctors are trying their best, but they're not looking in the right place. You know, I know this is a lot to put on an eight-year-old, but you have angered our ancestors by ignoring them. Now do you remember how to talk to them?  Yeah, that's right. Good. Now close your eyes, and we will ask for forgiveness together. You're doing good.  But we have to do more. The evil spirits are in the air, and the only way to stop them is by stopping the air.  You have to be brave. I'm not trying to hurt you. This will help you. I know it will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lue? You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I can't wake him up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lue! Lue, you're safe. You're in the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content> Get grandpa away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>He's not here, honey. It was just a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content>He was choking me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, Lue, it wasn't real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Lue</speaker><content>It was! He grabbed my neck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Those bruises weren't there before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He had the dream, and then he had the bruising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More likely — and by “likely,” I mean “rationally” — it's the other way around. His brain felt the pain in his neck and created the dream to explain it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Coagulopathy? Lung problems cause a clotting disturbance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He would have bruises everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is it really preposterous that dreams can have physical manifestations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, short answer is—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thoughts during sleep can and do cause physical changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that right, Dr. Park? Did you wake up this morning experiencing physical changes? It's medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her dream doesn't mean anything. Can we start acting like it doesn't mean anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. We could also start acting like walls don't mean anything, but then we'd hurt our noses. You've been taking the high road. You haven't been teasing in an obviously teasable situation because you know it does mean something. She hates the dream because it makes her feel vulnerable. You love the dream because it makes you feel superior. The poor lass who can't help but fall sway to your charms, and you're bestowing upon her the gift of illusory irrelevance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Can you please hint to House that you had a sex dream? I'd really prefer not to get distracted with trying to cure the patient today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I refuse to divulge my dreams about girl-on-girl loofa action. The bruising could indicate anemia, a vitamin C deficiency, or even leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is so weird that you and I had the same dream. I assume yours also ends with me achieving ecstasy while simultaneously placing third in the New York City marathon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Third?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a realist. Liver failure can cause gibberish from encephalopathy, constipation, bruising, and breathing problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Hepatic fibrosis could hit someone his age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So let's hit his liver. Get a biopsy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Angle a bit more superiorly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>He keeps having these nightmares that become real. They really hurt him. I don't want to believe that a nightmare can do that, but I—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm struggling with it too, but these things can be explained medically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>But you haven't. Every doctor, every idea they've had, it's been wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Liver biopsy's back. Team's about to meet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Back to avoiding eye contact with me? House got to you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Want me to gaze longingly into your eyes as I tell you the test results?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I want you to treat me like a friend, which means getting over the fact that you like me more than I like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Yeah, egotism and preening really turn me on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Too bad I'm not attracted to androgyny and self-pity, or you'd have it made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Because anyone who hasn't gotten wet from your petri dish of STDs clearly has low self-esteem!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Dick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why didn't your lips move when you said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Chase!  You coming? Liver biopsy's back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll be right there.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Biopsy was negative for fibrosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>So once again, you don't know what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's always good to rule out the bad things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Doctors!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Was he…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was levitating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool. So the one thing we know for sure is he was not levitating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He was floating 6 inches off the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He could've just been arching his back off the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes, but then I would have come into the room and reported that the patient was weirdly arching his back off the bed.  It was his whole body. He was levitating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So many questions… starting with why did Chase address his comment to someone who wasn't even in the room? Hocus pocus, on my feet you idiots must focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh… uh… extreme… drained…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The kid's not a magician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course not. He's the lovely assistant. 'Cause grandpa pig sticker is waving the wand. Middling with… is Chase trying to avoid Taub, or is he trying to prove that he's not avoiding Park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We checked the bed. There were no platforms or wires. This wasn't a trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Tetanus could cause muscle rigidity. Maybe he was propped up by his heel and elbow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Except he wasn't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tetanus wouldn't cause that kind of breathing difficulty. And ending with… if Chase is trying not to avoid Park, why is he doing this today and not yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But hypocalcemia could, and the enema we administered to cure his constipation had a high phosphorous load, which could make him transiently hypocalcemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a long shot, but at least it has the benefit of being rational. Go pump up his electrolytes and start beta-blockers. And good news for Park: I think Chase had a sex dream about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dreams don't mean anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I don't know. Nothing you've done has helped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we don't start and he has another seizure, the neurological damage could be permanent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>My father-in-law — he thinks the calling ceremony didn't work because Lue wasn't there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you think he's right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm sorry, but there's no way we can allow him to perform an exorcism in your son's hospital room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Then I will have to take him home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A day ago, you were insulted I'd even think you might believe that stuff, and now you're willing to stop all treatment, so you can try it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Maybe Xang was right about Kao. The man I loved wasn't evil and would never do what he did. He was… possessed. And my son needs his soul back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why not? As long as he doesn't feed the kid anything or put anything on his skin that we haven't verified is harmless, what's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I agree. And since we're establishing a new policy of “What the hell, we'll try anything,” I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance while singing Waka Waka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As long as you get the mom and Shakira to consent. It's no different than having a priest or rabbi lead a prayer vigil. The mom is scared and confused and desperate for anything that'll give her hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. But in the long run, I think you'll be happier having our lawyer declare her unfit. That way you won't be ratifying superstition over science, and I'll still be working here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And why would that make me happier?  You're not going anywhere, and we're not “ratifying” their beliefs, we're respecting them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do realize it may involve animal sacrifice.  People who live in glass hospitals should not throw exorcisms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll talk to the mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I don't want to deny him the medicine, I just… want to make sure I try everything I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I understand that, but you have to understand that we're a hospital, not a temple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>Then I'll take him elsewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, you won't. He's sick. We can't let him leave here. I'm sorry, you really have no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>I spoke to a lawyer. He told me as long as I wasn't saying no to your treatment, you couldn't say no to my religion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give me 24 hours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>It's from my Uncle in Poland. My Aunt Luba, they put her in nursing home two months ago!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>My mother, I talk to her twice a week and she never even mentioned it. Wh–what does she think? That I can't handle? I am 29 years old! I am not a child!  Were you going out tonight?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Lida</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'm not sure. Lue, I need you to squeeze my hand. He's not responding.  Get me an amp of D50!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about a carotid aneurysm? We should do an angiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He's got normal carotid pulses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares? Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sorry, do we not treat idiots? Because I thought—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her kid levitated. That happens to my girl, I'm expanding my diagnostic horizons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All the more reason why we should shut down. We cure this kid now, crazy grandpa and his magic beads get all the credit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And since when do you care about credit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Since when do I care about this kid? All I care about is sending mommy out into the world having faith in faith. Kid's better off dead. As soon as she's done appeasing the gods, let's talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about Kawasaki? It explains the irregular heartbeat, respiratory distress, and seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Which means he needs a coronary bypass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It can't be Kawasaki. Echo would have shown it. But a patent ductus arteriosis—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It can't be a PDA. He's not an infant, nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe he has. Maybe he had an infected ductus, which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So no evidence is evidence of evidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm just saying, it's consistent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's a billion-to-one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means there's seven people in the world who fit the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I thought we were looking for 100.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought. With idiot doctors like you—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> You're wrong.  But the treatment's just ibuprofen. Closes the malformed duct. Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, worst-case scenario is you piss me off—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're not gonna let us save an eight-year-old because one more person might embrace religion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does anyone here think my diagnosis is right?  Well, then I have decided for today only, to respect your opinions. We will proceed according to your diagnosis and nothing else. That's an order. Good luck.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Well, it could mean the obvious, that you want some of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>When will you learn that that look is insulting? Or it could just mean that we like each other. I'm weird, and you're pretty, but we connect. We feel safe. We trust each other.</content></utterance>
