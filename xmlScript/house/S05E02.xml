<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Class is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>What's going on? Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm a doctor. Did you have a corneal transplant five years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Every other patient who had a transplanted organ from that donor is either dead or dying. You got a purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content> I feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't mean to scare you, but so did the others.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One living, one almost dead. Four fully dead. Nothing in common except their donor. Carl got a new heart and lung — liver kills him. Tibalt got a new liver, lung killed him. Holly got a new kidney, her heart blows up. And Frank, the old guy gasping for breath upstairs, he got an intestinal graft, his pancreas is failing. All within eight months of each other. And in each case, serious complications came on suddenly and without warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Which means arrhythmia, massive pulmonary embolus, or cerebral bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did Wilson do for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> If the donor had an infection that somehow slipped by a screening, it could lay dormant —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Five organ systems hit. Would need five infections for it to somehow slip by screening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, sure, he made me laugh on a rainy day, made me see the colors I never knew —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>None of the donated organs were hit. It means whatever they got came from the donor's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That wouldn't help us narrow down what —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It narrows down who. Corneal transplants are bloodless. It means Apple's gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You secure enough in that theory to send her home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I guess we could wait till we figure out what's wrong with Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh. And how many colors are there really? Once you got red, blue, and green —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He paid for your lunch, liked Monster Trucks, and was your conscience. Autoimmune disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>ANA at autopsy of all four victims were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wouldn't cover vasculitis. Henoch-Schonlein purpura —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Antiphospholipid antibodies, normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then that leaves cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cancers have names. They have a progression. They affect specific organs. Bone cancer can't turn into liver cancer. Forget cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's cancer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right, of course. What was I thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No single type of cancer blew up three organs in the chest while also herniating in the fighter's brain stem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fighter's irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You don't like coincidences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It would be a coincidence if six transplant recipients had nothing else wrong with them — like being an idiot, which leads to getting your head knocked off. The others had cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Four autopsies and about 1,000 lab tests say it's not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Redo the thousand tests and the four autopsies. Taub and Kutner, check out the donor. Find out which cancer —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He didn't die of cancer. His head got chopped off in an industrial accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Find out which cancer would have killed him. Check the home and office for carcinogens, toxins —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's been dead for four years. I assume his home's been rented to someone else by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Find out which cancer killed them.  Did I forget you? You can check out the patient's eye.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put this on Dr. O'Shea.  And some chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Word is you're into monster trucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're astute.  No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vicodin, opioids, some B12. Need a little kick in the afternoon. You got a problem with that?  I think I'm falling in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Her right eye's failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it's not. Everyone else's transplanted organs were fine. It means her eye is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to remove the eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's her only working eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could remove the other one, but since it's not killing her, I thought this way was less insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do you have some ethical problem with what I'm doing that you could express in a unique way which might actually make me think that I'm wrong even though I'll never admit it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are funny.  The problem's not in her eye. It's in her head.  You wanna come over and watch Prescription Passion at my place tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neither am I. If you don't want to have sex, that's cool with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll grow on you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>L... P... E... Do I have to be in the same room as him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever he's got, you've got. Fifth line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pretty sure. Fifth line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>Am I gonna die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can we talk about something besides you for a moment? Like maybe the fifth line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>F... E... O... S... P. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sorry. We need to remove your eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>My eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A moment ago, you thought you were dying. Blind's actually good news. Unfortunately, he's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You just did the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She didn't squint. Which means the eye thinks it's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. The eye doesn't think. The brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong. Which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye. Which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head. Don't worry.  It doesn't hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hallucination. That's a brain thing, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>500 different things can cause hallucination. Doesn't mean it's neurological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does if one of the other organ recipients also had a brain issue. Did he just drop his hands? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, none of them had brain issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If his pupils dilated, if his pupils were fixed, if there was a twitch...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He got hit in the head, he died, no mystery. That was your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yesterday. You live, you learn. Who shot this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Guy who runs the gym has a camera. Uploads the nasty stuff online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't see the dead guy's face. I can't see his face. Can't see the twitch, can't see the pupils —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We know the tennis player had a heart problem. We can maybe tie that to the tuba player's lungs, and then somehow tie both those things, to the construction worker's liver, and then possibly meander over to Frank's pancreatic failure, but nothing causes simultaneous brain and heart problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cancer made no sense. The head and heart make less than no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> That makes no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know. I was making a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh, good. I thought you were an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why are you talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh, the guy doing manual labor can't have an opinion? I might be a genius who just happens to have a passion for fixing coffee machines. No, I'm obviously not, but that's rude to make assumptions about people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Donor's history came up clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Ha. Ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Did he just laugh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, no, I sneezed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's a genius coffee repairman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Coffee repairman wears argyle socks? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I thought I already talked about not judging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What kind of idiot wears argyle socks with construction boots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Uh, I'm not an idiot. I'm just… I'm not good at disguises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's apparently a very bad private investigator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, why is he pretending to fix the coffee machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I wanted to find out what you guys found out before I find out what he found out. So I can find out if I need a private investigator. So, nu?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The donor has no history of unusual infections, no international travel in the 12 months —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. No, seriously, that's how I sneeze.  He was in Madrid and the Bahamas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Credit card receipts showed no —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Girlfriend paid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There is no girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>She was his high school sweetheart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>High school sweetheart is married to his best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I know. Shhh. She had a kid four years ago. Timing fits. She's still pretty hot though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You found out anything medical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>The kid has a tummy ache. Also, the dead guy was exposed to mercury, mold, and hydrous perchloric acid because their sex pad was next to a garage that was demolished after those toxins were found. Oh, yeah, that will be $2,300. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll get you a check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, I don't take checks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think I'm gonna stop payment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I am, $2,300 is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, actually, that price includes footage of the boxing match from four different angles. 30% of the crowd paid by credit card. I got their names. Four of them had digital cameras, which I composited like NASA did for the pics of Mars. You know, the rovers and all that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pupils were dilated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But he didn't drop his hands, which means he maintained muscle tensity —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God, that was petty of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He maintained muscle tensity, but was momentarily distracted when he got hit. That's a temporal lobe seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Does that PI guy mean we don't have to break into people's homes anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the whole reason you went to medical school. I'm not gonna take that away from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's better than we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And costs more. Gonna biopsy the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were right, but no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Temporal lobe controls speech, hearing, memory. She loses those things, she's gonna be a terrific date, but beyond that —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We cut out a piece of it, good chance she's a vegetable. Nothing to hear, nothing to say, nothing to look back on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. She has so much to live for.  Do we have another patient who's almost finished with all their living? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So it's okay to stab his brain because he's old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it's okay to stab his brain because he's dead if you don't. Get the widow to say yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The lung inflammation is a complication of the pancreatic failure, which is reversible. This is actually his best chance. If we can find out what's wrong...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content> Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>I have a husband. I have a two-year-old daughter. Her name is Julia. You'd be saving her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. But her life is still worth —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>I lied to save my life. Wouldn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>No, you'd just rob me of my only chance so your husband can struggle to breathe for a few more days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>You want to hate me so you won't feel guilty.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>To where? We've gone from making no sense, to making less sense, and then taken a step backwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Each of these people were killed by one thing that attacked one organ. But never the same organ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could the donor have had two things wrong?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me something else that explains this constellation of patients, then you can call me an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I didn't call you an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Perforated intestine. If this thing started as normal bacteria living in the intestines but got into a blood vessel through a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall, then they would affect every organ through the blood stream. It screws up everything. For everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. It's a long shot. It is possible that I'm an ass. Ironically, we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She starts getting abdominal pain, shove a tube up her rear before it can get away. And test anyone else with stomach pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Everyone else is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not everyone. The one thing the donor gave to each of these people is his DNA. Anyone else have his DNA?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right, it's not a tummy ache, it's a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancreas ache.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know the guy. I got no logical reason —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>To be his friend? Have you never seen an after-school special? That is part of the pleasure of friendship: trusting without absolute evidence and then being rewarded for that trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're taking pictures of a guy who's having an affair with his own sister. And you're lecturing me about the rewards of trust.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then that just leaves cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The fact that the kid's colonoscopy was negative doesn't prove anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything. Excellent point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We don't know if the kid inherited anything. Even if she did, Kutner's theory is that the thing's intermittent.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death. And that seems like an obstacle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What if there was a way around that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Without a living system, there's not enough pressure to get fluid all the way up. Life we can't create, yet, but pressure's easy.

<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe a little more pressure? </content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's finally accelerating. Apple's heart rate has become irregular. Breathing is labored. Colonoscopy's still showing no leaks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>You rang emergency to get her chart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. That was bad of me. But I'm pretty sure the chart's supposed to be attached to the bed so that gimp doctors don't have to look all over the place while patients die.  Thank you so much.

<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>Then why should I sign it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a good question. It deserves a complicated answer. Placebo effect. People have confidence in doctors. They have confidence in diagnoses, confidence in medicine. Sometimes they get a little better just because they think they will. And that can make us think that the wrong answer is the right answer. Which is very bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>So you do have proof that it's cancer but you can't tell me because it might affect the way I react to the medicine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No one. I just like her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are stalking her, just not for very long. So what else can you tell me that I might care about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>He attends this grief counseling thing twice a week where they go around the room and cry about who's dead. Cameron's been to his house several times. They just talk about death and losing loved ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What…?  If she turns her head, she's gonna see that we're walking the wrong direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No, no, no, she won't. I'm very nondescript.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Well, then you stay four feet behind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you know what they're talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I'm in the same grief counseling group. I recently lost my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I didn't lose a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a PI who can't lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I can lie. I'm just not all that good at it. Well, Dr. Cuddy's been over to Wilson's twice and phoned a bunch of times. Foreman called him. And the rest of the time Wilson's been reading meditation books and magazines about restoring barns.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-30"><speaker>Target</speaker><content> More uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's not your type. Your type is much stupider than her. What did Wilson say about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-32"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh, you've never come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the grief counseling or in the other —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-34"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Anywhere, I got three bugs in his home and one in his car. If I didn't know you, I wouldn't even know you existed.  Which is good news. Only two things you ignore — things that aren't important and things you wish weren't important. And wishing never works.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have a way of thinking about things. It's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear. It complements mine. It drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cancer stem cells are real. They explain everything. They're like embryonic stem cells. They become whatever they want. Donor had them, the recipients got them. They floated around, they landed on an organ, got bathed in cytomes and partially differentiated. And the key word there is partially. In the tuba player, they became lung, but not lung. In the tennis player, they became heart, but not heart. Stop me if you've figured out the pattern. They looked as if they belonged, but they weren't doing their jobs. And when they were really needed, boom. Chemo worked because cells are basically tumors. Chemo shrunk them.  You're still gonna say no, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You've no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have the brain scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The normal brain scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is why I need to take off her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>To treat or to prove you're right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To treat. Chemo's not killing anything. It's just hiding the real problem. She's gonna crash. If we wait until she does crash, it might be too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So the next step is what? I say no, and then you do something to make her crash so that I'll think you've proven your theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I would never do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you won't.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You might want to check her IV. From here, it looks like saline instead of chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, they look identical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Still. You should probably check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You switched her meds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How could I? I had no access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Close her back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's no reason to —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No reason not to. The stupidly dangerous part is already over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>We're ready with the neural net.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Is that someone's brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except for the part that isn't brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Hey, that's the patient I — You said she'd be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a better liar than you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I swapped her meds. I mean, she's got a brain problem. I coulda killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yup. The neural net will show us how fast her neurons are firing. If there's something in the way, say... Brain that's not brain, the normal neural impulses will be sucked into a vortex because they're unable to do their job. The computer will then process it and give us a picture of where to cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Sorry, I thought that's what you wanted to hear. You think all this is amazingly cool. And you have no one else, so you're paying a guy to listen. Sorry —just trying to save you some cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm on the clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Yeah, why wouldn't you be? You think this is interesting to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I see it. Can you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Turns out you didn't kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Cool. You owe me $5,000.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>I can smell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, like you're a field of roses.  Peppermint tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>You ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Never really bought that. I don't care how often a kid cries, he's being eaten by a wolf, mom's gonna come running.  The world is ugly. People kill. They go hungry.  Just proving a point.  People are asses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>Why are you telling me this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because the world is not as ugly as you think it is. Your transplanted cornea's fine, your eye is fine, but your brain wasn't working right. I'm gonna take the gauze off your eyes now. It's gonna be bright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The brain cells that weren't brain cells were in the way of processing visual information correctly. After the transplant, you could see, but not see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>I could see. I could read.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know. What I do know is that you were not seeing what everyone else was seeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Apple</speaker><content>And now? Things are gonna be... beautiful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Things'll be what they are.  How do I look?</content></utterance>
