<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>I'm clutching my head in pain, and he asks if it hurts?  What are you, some kind of med student? You look like you still have theme birthday parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Any problems concentrating in school lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>Uh, besides the dreams of running my tongue along my French teacher's breasts? No, I'm doing quite great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>The rage and pain could be caused by a parasite. Does he eat a lot of sushi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>No. Uh, he was a vegetarian until just a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Any changes in behaviour since the new diet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> No. He's been this way since he became a teenager. It doesn't matter how much I yell or punish, he's still gonna say...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> Yeah, let's all shed a tear for poor little Nate's mother.  Any more stupid questions?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I like this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You haven't met him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know you hate him. What more do I need to know?  The kid's not a clich√©. Anybody can get into a fight after losing. It takes real creativity to beat up someone you just beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Pain's not limited to his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>The rest is bumps and bruises accounted for by the seventeen fights he's been in this semester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Concussion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>MRI was clean. No frontal lobe tumor. And the tox screen showed no trace of coke or amphetamines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Nate went medieval on the other kid. Could be...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hold on.  I'm having a moment. This...  this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But not the personality disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>There is no personality disorder. He's a teenager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate?  He's having cluster headaches. Probably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>If it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him. He's still in pain. Which means...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Fine! You do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> No way. He's your brat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I'll do it. But I've got a job interview after work. Anything comes up later, you guys handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Need a peer recommendation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Cameron's should suffice.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's safe. The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells which will hopefully squelch the head pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>Is there anything you can do about the other pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>From the fights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, my face, my shoulder, my stomach. I can barely bend my fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're already on pain meds. Nothing more I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>Sure you can, man. Tell your  homies to quit stomping on me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> I'll get the word out that you're a great guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> So, do people watch what they say around you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Because I'm black?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> No, because you're gay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Cluster headaches can persist for years, cause irritability or even hostility towards others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>You mean, the illness is affecting his personality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>If these treatments work, it could...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>... change him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> Oh. Oh, you must think I'm awful. Here, my son's lying in a hospital bed and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> I-I'm pretty sure I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> I thought I was a bad mother. And I hated myself. Because I hated him.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>... fine morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Blood thinners and TMS had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You accusing the symptoms of lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Could be hemochromatosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wouldn't account for the personality disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>What about hypothyroidism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>What about ruptured dermoid cyst?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right. It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> The thing that Cameron said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Way to think outside the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But no fat in the ventricles. It's cluster headaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Normal treatment didn't work. Abnormal treatment didn't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good point, Foreman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The treatments don't always work. Symptoms never lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>The only approved treatment left for cluster headaches is brain surgery. And that's not even a guarantee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Back off, Foreman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Something on your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because you totally can't tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I had a job interview lined up at New York Mercy yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Didn't happen, because apparently I called to cancel. I don't remember making that call. You think I have neurological issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Why are you jerking me around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It wasn't me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah! It was one of the other petty, socially repressed asses I work for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Would it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If the adult way doesn't work, why bother with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I've been totally professional! Gave two weeks notice, continued to work cases! Scheduled my interviews on my own time! You have no right to screw with my future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> It wasn't me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I only sabotage people I consider worth it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You are one evil,... cunning woman. It's a massive turn-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You girls can gossip later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> When I said, "You girls can gossip later," I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Well, I take it you're off your antidepressants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ah, you're deflecting. Only I'm allowed to do that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Does Foreman actually think I did that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Why would I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Do you want him to leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Were you planning on doing something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I'm waiting for board approval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But if he takes the job, there's nothing to be done. You had to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Wasn't me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Looking for a tell. Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Send in Nurse Unger when you pass her on your way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh! Almost forgot. I need to give a sixteen-year-old magic mushrooms to treat a cluster headache. Is that cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Yeah, no problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I was being sarcastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wouldn't look that way in the court transcript. Mushrooms have psilocybins that work on cluster headaches. It's either that or cutting into his brain and going on a fishing expedition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I assume you've considered he could have a psychogenic experience. Possibly suffer a fit of severe paranoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Well, I have now. Yeah, it's definitely better that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it instead of an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use. Takes the stink off if the patient decides to put on a cape and fly off the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Low dose. No more than ten milligrams. Tightly controlled setting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>And make sure the mother signs off on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Party on, Garth. And don't stand in Foreman's way. It's just wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff. So, when do I get 'em?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>I went to college. I know about mushrooms. A friend of a friend shot himself in the foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> They're not giving me a gun, Enid! Sign the consent form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We'll be monitoring him, but cardiac arrest is possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> Big E... small N...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> And if... the mushrooms don't work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>The next step would be a type of brain surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Your head, Nate. We need to know how the pain is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> What I got here... is the opposite of pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>That means you're suffering from cluster headaches. Which means, hopefully...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Thanks.  Focus on phrases like "You were right about the cluster headaches."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>But wrong about what caused them. Vascular problem in a major artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-35"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's having a seizure. Four milligrams IV Lorazepam.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So we've got one more symptom, one less diagnosis.  I assume they're gonna call for references? You give 'em my name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No. Amyloidosis can cause seizures, and the protein buildup could cause organ failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Wouldn't alter his personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Whose name did you give?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ouch! That can't look good.  I hate this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>What if we're not dealing with one condition? What if it's multiple conditions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Uh-uh, it's gotta be one. It's always one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Nothing explains this constellation of symptoms. We've gotta be missing something. Maybe the kid lied about some medication. Maybe he's hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Why would he be hiding something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>I don't know, because he's... evil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> There. Now all we're looking at is a simple, evil jerk with amyloidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're not being objective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Amyloidosis was your idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You were right, it doesn't fit the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, it does.  Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You crossed it off because you wanna hate the kid. And you can't hate him if he's a victim...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You want him to be a victim because you wanna believe that people are good. And if they're not, it's gotta be a chemical problem. Except they're not, and it's not.  Flush him with immunosuppressants. Get a biopsy to confirm, and find him a marrow donor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>What will happen to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Substances called amyloid proteins build up in the body's organs, shutting them down. It's a fairly rare disease. And I'm afraid it can be fatal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> So do you operate or something to take them out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He needs a bone marrow transplant. Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank. We should test you as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>When you first told me he was sick, I was... happy. Relieved. Now...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Wish I could. But your body has to be clear so it's ready for a marrow transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>Hey, Dr. X.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>I know you've busted ass trying to save me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>I wasn't gonna thank you.  I was gonna tell you you really suck at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> We're doing our best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>That's sort of my point. Your best really sucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Nerve biopsy was clean. No evidence of amyloidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He's running a fever. If it's two conditions, one of them's gotta be an infection. We should start him on antibiotics, see what clears up, what doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Is he having trouble breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, he has mucus in his chest from an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Could also be an amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Look, you got two choices. Engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're not ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There was a third choice. Don't do what I asked. You coulda defied me, stuck the kid on antibiotics. But you didn't. Because you still trust my judgment more than your own.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You sabotaged Foreman's job interview, didn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Foreman's already been over this.  It wasn't me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Everybody's chasing ghosts over this. Which means either nobody did it, or somebody wants everybody chasing ghosts. Now, who does that sound like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Because as long as Foreman thought you were guilty, he was gonna be useless around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You know,  sometimes I forget why I hired you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You cost him a good opportunity and gained nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I cost him a crappy opportunity. New York Mercy's where you go to treat boils and cysts and build a 401K.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>If you want him to stay, tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I don't and there'd be no point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You do. And the point would be to make him feel like he's wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He doesn't need that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>All right, then. It'd make him feel like maybe you weren't evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He needs that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Talk to Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We dumped one symptom. But forgot to add one.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>Are you...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes! I am.  Black or white?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content> Just limp away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> He doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Pick one, or...  this comes out. And, for all you know, this is really important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>Stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That hurts, right? Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this. You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> Your doctors said he needs immunosuppressants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The body absorbs iron from food, but can't process it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Those body aches, they were not from the fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content> His personality issues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Sorry. The iron's innocent on that count. Your kid's a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And, yeah, it's probably your fault. Although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less... almost dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, nurse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> This patient is bleeding for some reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>ENID</speaker><content>Is he going to be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I wouldn't have taken your bishop. I'd have moved my queen to D6, defusing the threat. Then rook to E8, attacking the king's pawn. I'd have lost the exchange, but won the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-26"><speaker>NATE</speaker><content>I was bluffing. And that's why...  you lost.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Still nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Run the test again. Recheck your results.</content></utterance>
