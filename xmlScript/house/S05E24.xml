<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>My fish isn’t bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Warren</speaker><content>But it’s not great either, I’m sure. I warned you against the snapper.</content></utterance>

House isn’t gonna care. Does “black tie optional” really mean black tie? Cause I don’t wanna rent…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s been a glitch with the wedding. And House will be interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A glitch?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A glitch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> This is Dr. Taub. Tell him about shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Uh, I go into a grocery store. Everything seems normal. I get to the checkout and there’s all these extra items in the cart. Stuff I didn’t put there. Stuff that I hate. My left hand hates me. </content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ding, ding ding hmm hmm hmm. Just warning you — I’m in a good mood. And largely pain free. So I have no idea how things are going —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Set off by a stroke? Or is there a pony in the backyard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Split brain. Right hemisphere controls the left and —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is making life miserable. Non-logical thinkers often do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Current issue isn’t the split brain. The surgery corrected —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re dissing the right hemisphere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Most people who have this operation don’t even notice they’re missing anything. Left brain has language, arithmetic, rationality. Right brain is a mute loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Right brain is more aesthetically oriented. Has greater facial recognition. I couldn’t have been a plastic surgeon without it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. And where would junior high be without our ability to judge people on aesthetics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right brain’s also more aware of the present moment, our place in the universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throws buns at people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His present symptoms could mean autoimmune disease, nasolacrimal tumor, an infection or just a cold.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else.  Begin eliminating. Search the home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The, uh…  Isn’t that like locking the barn door after the horse has put his face between your breasts for an hour and a half?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m your boss. You’re an employee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I’m not normally into role-playing, but if you wanna… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>People who get close to you get hurt. That’s a fact. You’re also a valued doctor in this hospital. That’s another fact. From now on, we’re gonna focus on the second fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So this isn’t you freaking out over last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This isn’t an emotional decision. I’m just giving you the rules. You can either accept them or leave.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I slept with Cuddy. After she helped me detox from Vicodin. I’ve been clean for almost 24 hours now.  Okay. Thought I’d mention it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow.  Wow. One for each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s what she said. A ha ha ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How’s the pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s probably got some bruising…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. I get it. You’re a stud. This is serious, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I feel better than I did four hours ago. Four hours from now, I’ll feel better than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The other wow. You were sober. She was sober?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clean and sober and hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow. This is fantastic. How are you gonna screw it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Several good options. Unfortunately I don’t think she’s gonna give me the pleasure. She left before I woke up, and five minutes ago she told me that I’m just an employee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, either she’s actually in love with you and scared, or she realized last night was a gigantic mistake. You were needy and vulnerable. She was maternal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think she jumped me out of pity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I’m saying whatever’s going on you… need to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. </content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Does our patient freak you out a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If he’s two people, then we’re all two people, and we just don’t know it. What does that say about identity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It says we’re making it up as we go along, which I find freeing. Wow, I haven’t been in a bathroom this size since my dorm in med school.  Is that fungus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’s from the steam build-up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What do you think of this ‘glitch’ with Chase and Cameron’s wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’s always a sad thing when sperm comes between people.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I hear the sperm is very good today. I mean the salmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No other tables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You’d let your wife keep another man’s offspring on ice next to the frozen peas, just in case? That’s what this is about. She’s not ready to commit to me. She’s planning for failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Did you know that male fruit flies have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid that inhibit the sperm of other males. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson says we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We talked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I agree.  This has clearly gotten past the talking stage. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Hi. Great. Did you find my MP3?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Annie</speaker><content>Uh, not yet. But I got your shaving stuff, toothpaste, deodorant, some magazines and this cactus from your window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>You didn’t have to do that, really. The hospital supplies all that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Annie</speaker><content>I’m still trying too hard, huh? Trying to get your other half to like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. Don’t say that, okay? I like you. Which means that it —  We shouldn’t read into that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Antifungal meds. Ordinarily we’d put them in your IV but since your right brain doesn’t seem too fond of IVs… You should be feeling better in a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Annie</speaker><content>I have to get back to work. Rick says your shift will be waiting for you when you get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Thanks.  Oh! Oh my God! God, I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Annie</speaker><content>I have to go. I have to get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Babe, wait. Hold on! No, it wasn’t me.  I can’t walk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, obviously it wasn’t the fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And it’s not a coordination issue. Dehydration can cause loss of balance. We haven’t had him on IV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, good skin turgor. Not orthostatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be our tax dollars at work, constantly building new roadways and bridges.  A meningioma. Slow growing. Could extend along the subosteal layer of the cranial cavity and be hidden by the bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The cancer cells are actually re-growing a connection between the left and right hemispheres.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you’re right, the two halves have begun sending messages again, but it’s too early in the process for him to pick up on it. But, we can test for it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn’t talk to her, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I talked, she’d have lied. I’d have lied. And though two negatives make a positive, I thought thermal-imaging photos seemed simpler. Note how many more heated areas appear after less than a minute with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So it’s either love or possibly rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have no plans to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Manipulation is in your genetic code. You think I’m making a mistake, you move in to correct it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You are making a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She lied to me. Either last night or today. I need to find out which and why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And clearly, thermal imaging is the way. This isn’t a case. You’re not looking for a diagnosis. If this matters at all to you, please, for once in your life, be an adult.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Keep your eyes focused on the plus sign. Any image that appears on the far right will only be seen by your left brain. And any image on your far left will only be seen by your right brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just start by saying the words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Book. Giraffe. Willow. Fortunate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re not saying the word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>I didn’t see a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could you draw a picture of what you think the word might be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Uh. Look. I didn’t see…  Candle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s not freaky at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No communication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Scott, why are you standing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Uh… I’m a little chilly. I thought I’d get a sweater or something from my room. Is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A few more minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the left hemisphere… The side that’s obsessed with finding answers. The one that needs things to make sense. The interpreter. That’s where we tell the story of who we are and why we do things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That’s also the side that was wrong. Right brain's advantage is that it isn’t logical. Doesn’t choose which details to look at. Makes connections you could never see. You owe your insight to the “mute loser.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll send it tickets to a Phillies game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Confabulation means no communication. Means your theory’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But he is cold.  Why are you scratching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>It itches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ammonia breath.  Your liver is failing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I know for them to approve this price they’ll need statistical documentation. What? Why are you looking at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>When you first walked in, I was under the impression you wanted to say something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>About House and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There’s nothing to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I want permission to do a liver biopsy. We’re looking for sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you mean, fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What do you mean, what do I mean? Do you mean that because a liver biopsy is not a test that, by any stretch of the imagination, can be considered risky, so asking my permission is essentially wasting my time, and you’re wondering what my reaction to that will be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you trying to make me angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do your biopsy. And also do your clinic hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m blowing off my clinic hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Really? Let’s see how that goes.  Still not angry. Try again later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Uh, sorry. I know I’m a little ripe. Just a sweaty guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Always.  With a crazy left hand. Sometimes I fantasize about cutting it off. Just a fantasy. It’s the hand that’s crazy, not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What? If it doesn’t like an ultrasound wand, how’s it going to react to a needle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Can you get music into this room?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think you’re using your relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs. You should be in more pain so soon into detoxing, but your body’s full of romantic endorphins. And on top of that, you create this distraction of looking for proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy is not a Vicodin substitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Quite the opposite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have to wait for her to be ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great advice. You pretend that I’m gonna do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’ve made two major changes in your life. Not a time anyone’s judgment is at its best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn’t you use to argue that my judgment would be better off drugs? Admit it. You’re curious why I want to make her angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s convoluted, wrong and stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re dying to know what I found in her coffee cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oxytocin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oxytocin. The chemical involved in emotional bonding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her lips say “no,” her hormones say “Oh, my God, yes. More!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. For you to know her levels were elevated, you’d need a baseline to compare them with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I paid the guy in the gym to retrieve one of her water bottles from the trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Love inspires us to greatness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, I need to make her lose her temper. Which breaks her delusion. Which demonstrates to me and to her that there’s something underneath this facade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And then what happens? She admits everything and falls into your arms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s outcome one. Outcome two is she kills me. I think it’s 50/50 right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you’d say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re committing yourself to something. To someone. I mean it’s childish in a way but ultimately great. Assuming… Are you absolutely sure you want this to succeed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Eugene</speaker><content>Eugene Schwartz. Eugene Schwartz. Dr. Cuddy asked me to come up here from the clinic. She says you’re seeing patients in your office. It’s still free, though, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She sent him. That’s gotta mean something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’ll go get my decoder ring. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Eugene</speaker><content>I squawk. Like a parrot.  Cawwww. No. That’s not it. It started a few months ago. I was doing some woodworking in my garage. I was trying to make a chair. Was it the chair? Anyway, all of a sudden, from nowhere, this strange noise comes bursting out of my mouth. Caw, caw.  Tough to fake that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice pants. </content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So, your left hand would rather play air guitar than give me a hard time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>It’d rather play air guitar than tie shoes, eat dinner…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You’re right hand’s playing too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>I don’t wanna discourage it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>What’s that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>BP and O2 sats are dropping!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Need a bag of B-negative in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So much for sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Points to a clotting issue. Clots would explain all his symptoms. Why aren’t we in the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m tired of clinic duty. There’s only one thing that could cause squawking, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah. We gave him heparin and did an echo of his heart to see if it was throwing clots, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More air guitar?</content></utterance>

First, I can accept it’s over, pretend we don’t work in the same hospital, have selective visual impairment when we pass each other in the hall. Second, I can accept it’s over and leave —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just say the magic words: “I will destroy my husband’s sperm.”  Oh, you mean succeed without doing that. Probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I have doubts. Normal doubts. It’s not wrong to prepare for bad things to happen even if you don’t expect them to. I don’t expect my condo to burn down, but I have fire insurance.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your right brain has no idea why you’re suddenly getting up and putting on your jacket. It just gets dragged along. Next time, try saying it out loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Scott</speaker><content>Just say to the empty air “Hey, I think I’ll go to the store because we’re out of peanut butter”? How much did they teach you about people like me when you were learning to be a therapist?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the cancer’s too small to find, let’s make it easier. Let’s open him up and paint it. There’s a new procedure using scorpion toxin and infrared paint. Paint only works on the cancer cells. Makes ‘em easier to spot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We echoed the heart. No clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not while we were looking. Didn’t I open with that? The clots were caused by an arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not while we were looking!  Intermittent arrhythmia. This guy pulls our equipment off at the slightest provocation. We’d have to be watching at the exact moment it happened. Which I’m guessing from the way you two are scrambling around like idiots, is right now.  Yes. I’m saying do a transesophageal echo.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The heart looked healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia wouldn’t cause clots in a healthy ventricle. So start with the left atrial appendage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy’s BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.</content></utterance>

Ever since I’ve known Scott I’ve seen his left hand throw things but always sort of playfully, thinking it’s fun. But when he threw this…  it was angry. And that’s when his hand slapped me, too — when I brought it to him. Could it mean something?</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is beyond ass-hood! You have the luxury of not caring about your image. I do not!

<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I’m fired, I think that probably means I don’t have to see patients. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Eugene</speaker><content>I’m here as a squeaky wheel. I know how you doctors are. You’re busy. You get distracted. My lab results could be sitting in your in-box.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Acid splashes on the vocal chords, they tense, make that squawking sound. It’s completely harmless. I’m gonna give you a prescription and you are gonna go away.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>Eugene</speaker><content>At 86, what isn’t sore? Soreness is less important than squawking. It’s the squawking that was bothering my wife. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not a potbelly. It’s a tumor. That’s why pancreatic cancer was on my mind. My brain was trying to tell me…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It can cause acid reflux. We should scope you.</content></utterance>
