This is what you will wonder as I perform feats that will astound you! As you see there's nothing up my sleeves. And this hat… just an ordinary old hat. Watch as I wave three times above the hat and whisper the magic words; and now… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Dory</speaker><content>Mom it's not working! It's ripped!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>It's okay baby, it's just a little tear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Dory</speaker><content>Hurry up, mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> What are you so worried about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Nicky</speaker><content>Sally's going to make fun of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Sally Ayerson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Dory</speaker><content>She said her mom bought her dress as Bloomingdales. You had to make ours. We're going to look stupid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Do you girls remember that music we were listening to yesterday? That lady who sang about respect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Nicky</speaker><content>Retha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Aretha. That's right. Do you think she had lots of money growing up in Detroit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Dory</speaker><content>What's Detroit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>It's a city. The point is that she's one of the best singers ever. If Sally's mean to you again I'm just going to have to key her daddy's new convertible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Do you know what that means?  Good.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you speak to Chase and House yet? The disciplinary hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>The McGinley case. That's not for two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Tomorrow. Scheduling disaster, you don't want to hear it. You gotta get the boys' okay to move the hearing up, and you gotta do that whole legal advice thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Can you ask someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm asking you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Let me work with Chase. House should have separate counsel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Stop looking for whatever you're looking for. For the last month, House has been crowing that you can't work with him because you're just swooning in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>There is nothing approaching love in what I feel about him right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well if you can't work with him, it amounts to the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> We had a fight. It's awkward. Why not use another lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because 40% of our lawsuits last year were about House. You can't work with him, you can't work here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's over-reacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yes! And yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul. The only thing I did wrong was get caught. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Where's Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's too busy to service you until after work. I got a couple of minutes though. Feel free to say something like "What'll we do with the time left over?" Or you could just stew. That works as well.  She stews before she gets violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> This one says you're okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow. This one says I've advised you of your legal rights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Nope. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great.  And you thought this was going to be awkward. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You shouldn't sign it. Postponing is almost always the smart thing to do. Tempers cool, memories fade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They rule on me it’s done, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then let's get it over with. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Have you ever done a peer review before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Good. Here's a misnomer - these are your bosses. This will cost you some money, some privileges, or it could cost you your career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All I can tell them is what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>There's an objective reality to what happened and that committee is never going to know it. All they're going to know is what they picture happened, which depends a little on what you tell them, and a whole lot on HOW you tell them. May 11th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Patient presented to the clinic--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What's her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's in the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Do you know it?  Then use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kayla presented to the clinic with multiple joint and stomach pain. Dr Foreman was called in for a neurological consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Checking your sister's cerebral coordination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>The thing is in her leg and her stomach. Wait in the clinic for six hours so she can play patty cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She could have gone to the ER last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Oh yeah? You wanna come over and baby-sit her kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Ok, patient comes from a family of jerks, I get it. Can you stick to the medicine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There was some uveitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Meaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her iris - the color part of her eye - was inflamed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Meaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Worst case, blindness,  but there was an upside. It was weird enough to get House interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Young woman, joint pain. Gonorrhea is a possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's probably articular; maybe rheumatoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's typically small joints, this hit her knee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Takayasu's arthritis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a sed rate and serologies.  Child proof. How many kids are hopped up on vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Gimme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, like I'd ever get it back. Chase. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Don't care about the vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Might not just be her arteries, could be all her blood vessels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Vasculitis, with stomach pain… so Behcet’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, she'd have oral sores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or genital.  Go find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I thought she was Foreman's patient, why did you do the exam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She'd have oral sores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or genital. Go find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa Foreman… Chase can handle the pelvic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Any pain?  Is it bad?  This will go a little easier if you talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> I'm sorry. I umm… I just really hate hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When I was 12, had my tonsils out. Got to skip school, lots of ice cream; made me want to be a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>My mom… died when I was 8 so… I spent months at Princeton General.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> She died of DTs? Your mom?  Bottles stashed around the house? Mood swings? That whole deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>You've been there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My mom. Dad left, mom crawled inside a bottle. Made for a great Yr 12 of high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>You ok with your dad now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Does your dad have anything to do with this story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, it's just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, the two of you bonded, which is why you probably haven't been sued. Patients never sue doctors they like. But keep it brief, ok? The panel doesn't like to think they're being manipulated when they're being manipulated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She had some ulceration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Confirming Behcet’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I gave her some prednisone, an antacid and I ran a pathergy test on her arm; takes 24 hours to confirm. Told her any doctor could check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You didn't make an appointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nope. She just showed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Dr. Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hi. All right, let's take a look.  Okay, those little pustules mean it's positive. Talk to Nurse Previn; get an appointment with Dr. Broston in rheumatology. Behcet’s is very treatable. You're going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And you were just chatting on the phone to someone and she just happened to run into you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No appointment? No real examination?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just gave her the test results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>So, lower standard of care, you really couldn't be expected to notice there was anything else wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We didn't even go into an exam room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> As your lawyer, I can't stop you from lying, I can't even be in the room, but I would be remiss if I didn't prep you to lie better.  You wrote her a prescription, which means there was an examination. What really happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> Dr. Chase? Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Kayla. I'm here for the test… my arm? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh.  Oh yeah… umm, okay.  It's positive. Talk to Nurse Previn; get an appointment with Dr. Broston in rheumatology. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>I took that medicine you gave me? But my stomach still hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Behcet’s can be stronger than we thought, or it could be reflux from the prednisone. This is a stronger antacid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Doctor…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You didn't ask her anything about the stomach pain?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I made one little mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>As little mistakes go, that was a biggie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's only advising Chase? Not you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't even met this patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your disdain for human interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you. You sign the charts, you're responsible for everything Chase does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is why this doesn't matter; she protects Chase, she protects me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Unless her advice to Chase is to make a deal and give you up.  "I'm so sorry, if only Dr. House had paid attention, he'd never even met her, he never does."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cameron loves you. Chase loves his job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You really think Stacy hates me that much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think right now she hates you more than enough. You think emotion only affects doctors’ judgments?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Everything stems from that one interaction; they're going to slam you on it. Were you distracted? Your problem? Overworked, that's their problem. Forgetful, yours, lazy--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I just figured the stomach pain was the Behcet’s. Any doctor would have thought the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Then why did you call her an hour after she left the clinic? Nurse Previn said you asked her to have Kayla come back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The way she hesitated I thought she might have had a doorknob question.  Patient comes in, says he's got a sniffly nose; you examine him for 10 minutes right? Then you're leaving, hand on the doorknob, and he says "Oh yeah and my penis has turned green".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Embarrassing question, only important when patient saves it for last, so you knew she was about to ask the most important question… and you left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. I didn't. I figured it out later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Bad answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I wasn't thinking clearly at first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Worse answer. What was her doorknob question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I figured it might be blood in her stool, which could indicate a bleeding ulcer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content>35-yr-old female vomiting massive amounts of blood. LOC at work, BP 80 over 20, heart rate 140.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Push fluids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content>Three liters in the field, and we're boosting another one right now. It's gotta be a bleeding ulcer, doc. Co-worker says that she's been eating ibuprofens like candy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought she had Behcet’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content>1, 2, 3 </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I'm in her stomach. There's too much blood, I can't see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She burst an artery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> No, there. Bubbling, just a bad ulcer. Cauterizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Can't see, use more saline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hold on! Okay,  looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bleeding ulcer. We got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Systolic BP's 70.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where's the ulcer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's brown. I cauterized it. It must be something else.  There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Second ulcer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not anymore. It perforated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get her to an OR!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The surgeons were able to suture the perforation. But the contents of the patient's-  Kayla's stomach had spilled into her body. She got septic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Then the infection lowers her blood pressure…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>50 over palp at one point. It damaged her liver and kidneys. Listen, I know this looks bad, I obviously got the diagnosis wrong but I did everything by the book. I couldn't have known what was going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>If I skip my coffee I get cranky. Do you want anything?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why did Chase screw up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He forgot to ask her a question, does there need to be a reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It might help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>As far as I'm concerned, he made a little mistake. It happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>How far are you concerned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You think I'm biased?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're colleagues. You've worked together for over a year. And everyone says you slept together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Who says?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>The correct answer is "We're not involved and I'm not biased".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're not involved; and I don't know why he messed up. House has worked with him longer than I have. You should talk to House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah. Why did Chase screw up?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because he doesn't give a crap about patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Well he always gets positive patient reviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. He smiles all 84 of his teeth, tells them his tonsil story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It's a nice story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He still has his tonsils! As soon as he's out of the room, which is as soon as he can be out of the room, he starts in on the trash talk. Thinks not giving a crap makes him like House. Like it’s something to aspire to.  Am I going to have to testify?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I won't be encouraging them to call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What'd House say?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Two months like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me guess, no insurance, just heard about the free clinic. It's a good move. You don't want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From the doorway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It's confidential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool. I love gossip.  Hear that crackling sound like crumpling up paper? Keep listening. Let me know if it changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Two questions. Why did Chase screw up and how bad was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He said he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well I'm not a lawyer, but that seems like a sucky legal strategy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>They're gonna wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in Chase's position.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>God you two are a couple of geniuses. Deny everything; completely fool the lawyer who's trying to help you. Too bad the review committee members are actually doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm in her stomach. There's too much blood, I can't see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She burst an artery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. There. Bubbling, just a bad ulcer. Okay, cauterizing; looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bleeding ulcer, we've got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If by ‘fine’, you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of every orifice then yeah, I believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Systolic BP's 70.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Show me the ulcer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's brown. I cauterized it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sweep back, show me the whole stomach.  Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Second ulcer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not anymore. It perforated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get her to an OR!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let's go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was not fine 2 hours ago. She mentioned stomach pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, so I gave her a stronger--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't do an exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She just came in for a follow-up. The results of the pathergy test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe if she'd said something about taking ibuprofen, mentioned the rectal bleeding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Doctors skip all the time! It was a minor mistake; I couldn’t have known this was going to happen--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She might die because I had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Excuse me, testify about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uhh…  Chuck. I'm going to break from the parable of the wicked doctor and tell a little story about a patient. Let's call him… Buck, who has low O2 stats and crackling lung sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chuck</speaker><content>Like I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. His lung tissue's turning to rock. There's no known cause, no treatment. He is slowly suffocating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chuck</speaker><content>You're talking about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lung transplant's about a half a million dollars, but this poor sucker's got no insurance. If he tried to sign up now, he'd be excluded, pre-existing condition. But let me confirm with my lawyer . She confirms. If only Buck hadn't been diagnosed with fibrosis before he got insurance. So... back to the exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>That's how you tell this guy he's dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Such a hero; always righting wrongs. Who cares who you have to manipulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It's a point of principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>There's nothing for us to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That's why you're following me. I read some notes--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>If Chase screwed up--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was wrong. Terribly, terribly, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>If Chase screwed up so badly, why didn't you fire him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He has great hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> What are you hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Diarrhea, blood in the stool. Two simple questions you could have asked her six months ago and averted this whole thing. You didn't ask either, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Judging from your question, and your demeanour, I assume you were visiting with House. Been over this, I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Good doctors don't make mistakes--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good doctors never forget to ask questions? Then you've got your answer, apparently I'm not a good doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>FYI self-pity generally is not a good strategy in these hearings. What happened after the operation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The kidney damage isn't so bad. The liver damage is more worrisome. There's no dialysis for livers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I know, but if she loses her liver she can get a transplant, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We can put her on a list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I could do it. I could give her part of my liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Surgeons won't operate unless the donor's had a long time to weigh the decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>There's black markets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Those organs--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Ooh… ohhh my stomach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The pain constant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Ohhh… oh yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sharp or dull?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>Oh I don't know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's a little cold. Appendicitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, it's a clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nurse! Call the OR; we've got to prep her for an embolectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A CBC, PT and a liver panel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sepsis had lowered her BP so much she got clots in her liver. They blocked the hepatic artery, cut off the blood flow. Her liver was shocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And Cuddy listed her? With all the other problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Forget it. We can't give a liver to a woman this sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you listen to what you're saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There is no point in giving a new liver to somebody who also has vasculitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And kidney damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's healing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what's really killing her? Chase forgot to ask a standard question about stomach pain, so he missed the diagnosis, so she perforated, so she got sepsis, so her BP tanks, so she got blood clots, so she lost her liver.  Livers are important, Cuddy; can't live without them, hence the name. And here's the big issue, Chase is a hospital employee, and Kayla is the sympathetic mother of those 2 jury-friendly moppets Caleb and Cody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dory and Nicky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is a medical reason!  The family wins this hospital in a lawsuit; they'll turn it into condos. And people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Start praying for a 12-car pile-up on the turnpike 'cause we're not exactly swimming in livers over here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>When you're testifying, skip the details on how House convinced Cuddy. I don't think the people who got bumped down the transplant list need to know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It didn't matter anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>She next on the list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-40"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But she's AB negative. Very rare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-41"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>How long can she go on like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Probably another day or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-43"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> I'm donating my liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-44"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sam, we've talked about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-45"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I'm a perfect match; 6 out of 6 HLA proteins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-46"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How'd you get checked out so fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-47"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I know a guy in medical testing and I paid him to rush it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-48"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Sam bribed someone to rush his test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-49"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wouldn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-50"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Someone's going to get the blame for what happened, so the more we spread it around... might as well--- you said no surgeon would do a live donor transplant on such short notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-51"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House took care of that too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>Your patient's hardly clotting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>Pretty risky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well that's why I came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital. She's dead without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content> Get her in this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>My pleasure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And this was right before you ran the marathon, I suppose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What'd you do to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The hospital lawyer asks me if I did something unethical. If I did, the last person I tell is the hospital lawyer, especially since she's gone all 'old testament' on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You'll tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. Ok then. One caveat, I've moved past threesomes. I'm now into foursomes. If someone backs out then you've still got a threesome.  If two people back out, you're still having sex. You'd be amazed. Even if three people--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Anything you say is attorney-client. So you can get advice about the bad, bad thing you did, knowing I'll be tortured because I can't tell a soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Actually, it is kinda cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>Are you completely out of your mind? She's dying on her own, why would I volunteer to be her executioner?  I'd just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother, no matter what! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content> I make 600 grand a year; you think I'm going to risk tanking my percentages for 20 thousand? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's tax free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>For the record, I hope the department takes you and Chase and drop-kicks both your asses out the back door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Great;  means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery,  I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs. And you didn't thank her. Well that only happens when you're very, very intimate. That and the fact that you've been practically dancing around with your zipper open, used condom stuck in your shoe.  Your wife is apparently the only one who doesn't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>There is no way you'll tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly.  No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. Oh, and for the record, you are the worst transplant surgeon in this hospital. But unfortunately, you're the only one who's currently cheating on his wife. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You bribed him and then you blackmailed him?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made Ayersman do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And then there was that incident in the parking lot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Ayersman</speaker><content>Hey now! Don't do that! Hey what are you nuts?! Please, please! I didn't do it! I didn't do anything!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You blackmailed Ayersman before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn't seem fair, does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You just can't control yourself, can you? No matter how stupid, how self-destructive--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you? You're not mad because I broke into your psychiatrist's office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah, I was thrilled about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No I wouldn't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me tell you a story about a patient;  the patient we'll call,  Fusan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because Sam had rushed his tests, we were able to get them into surgery that afternoon. Dr Ayersman performed the live donor transplant. He resected the right lobe, hepatic vein, and hepatic artery of Sam's liver, and transplanted it into Kayla. The operation was a success. Kayla and Sam continued to receive routine care. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two months later, she came by for an exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>July 24th, be precise. You did the exam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Honestly, I just wanted to--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Honestly? So you've been lying up until now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Let's make a deal. I won't use the word 'honestly', and you'll quit stopping by to see House so you don't take it out on me afterwards, how about that?  I wanted to be as far away from Kayla as possible, but House was rubbing my nose in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How are the girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>They're great. Dory had her first crush, which was cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh yeah? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>And then her first sort of break up, which was not so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're hot. 99.3  You been coughing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pain in urinating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content>No. 99's not that high, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Immunosuppressants block fevers; you shouldn't have one at all. I'm sending a nurse in here to draw cultures, and I'm ordering a chest x-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I wasn't making any more mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Another phrase to avoid in front of the committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She spikes a fever an hour later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her AST and ALT are up. She's rejecting the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, it's just an infection. One of our cultures is growing a strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just one? Probably a contaminant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's dehydrated, her hematocrit's way up, it's strep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Transaminases are up too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's just stress from the strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's not rejecting the liver! It's just an infection, she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Worst case we could re-list her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-27"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> You House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Umm... well that depends. Are you going to hit  Dr. House? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-29"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>You haven't even seen my sister and you're being cute with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sam, we're talking about her right now. Her fever might--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-31"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Could be Hep B, Hep C, right? It's treatable. You give her interferon, she's ok. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know a lot about hepatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He just donated his liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're flushed. You sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-35"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I'm tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're hiding the fact that you're sick. Now why would you do that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-37"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Hey, wait, what are you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job. It's a very common way of getting Hep C, which you have. You've had it a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-39"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> It was going to keep me from giving my liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-40"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You paid off that lab tech to say you were clean?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-41"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>It hasn't been active in years. She was going to die if I--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You paid someone off? That is TOTALLY unethical! Get an MRI for him and his sister right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-43"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>She got Hep from me, didn't she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No! No, no, no, God no!  I think she got cancer from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-45"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>House was right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-46"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Brother had an undiagnosed hepatoma that was transplanted with his liver. Grew a lot faster in Kayla because she was immunosuppressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-47"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>How could House have known?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-48"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hepatitis can cause liver cancer. Plus her hematocrit, red blood cell count was high. Usually means dehydration, rare cases - cancer. We probably saved Sam's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-49"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We were able to operate on him early enough before it metastasized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-50"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kayla had already started rejecting the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-51"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And you couldn't re-list her because of the cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-52"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nothing we could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-53"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>This is good; the brother lying about his Hep. It's an intervening act, the proximate cause of her cancer and not your mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-54"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She would have died six months ago if he hadn't given up his liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-55"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Maybe. Can't prove it.  You need to come with me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Just been served with papers. Actually paper; one page.  Defendant Princeton-Plainsboro hospital and Dr Robert Chase; blah, blah, blah. Medical malpractice, negligence; blah, blah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're surprised they're suing? You think people love Chase so much they're gonna just forgo--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Punitive damages in the amount of 10 million dollars. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Punitives?! That means they're alleging gross negligence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well he's obviously out of his mind!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Larry Wusekus. He's not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ooh! I've been sued by him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You have been hiding things and lying to me all day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I haven't lied about anything. Except for the parts that I admitted I was lying about. And I'm not the one being sued. I feel funny. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Well what haven't you told us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Before she checked out, Sam found her a second liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She had cancer, how could she--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Black market. There was a doctor in Mexico City who was going to do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's leaving from JFK at 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To meet some Mexican guy in the back of a van with a pig's liver and a hacksaw?! This is nuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want to rat me out to House? He'll say if there's a chance in a billion then go for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This is not what she wants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's being manipulated by a morally guilty brother and a legally guiltier doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think she wants to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's dying either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase. How many people you know walking around with a black market organ from a third world surgeon, huh? This isn't going to be your salvation! It's just one more thing they'll pin on you! Go in there, be the good guy.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>No, there's no time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two minutes. Kayla, I made a mistake. I wasn't as blunt as I should have been about your odds. Probably didn't want to face it myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Dr. Chase, please don't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stress of the travel, the operation, even then, the cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Kayla, we are going!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My dad died. Lung cancer. I saw him a couple of months before it happened, we never talked about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I'm sorry your father died, but it has nothing--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He never even told me he was sick. I wish he had. It wou--  You're gonna die. Alone. Thousand of miles from your children, you don't want to do that to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Kayla…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> I'm sorry Sam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Kayla, you can't give up; if you do this, if you go home... I killed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> No. You gave me 3 months. You gave Dory and Nicky 3 more months with me. And when they found my cancer, they found yours; and I got to save my baby brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A week later, Kayla died at home. Sam was furious. Gotta be why the big lawsuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you buying this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Of course not; there was no illegal transplant. There's no causation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He was ready to kill me! Maybe he's lying to his lawyers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Or you're lying to us. Last Thursday he saw you for post-op care. If you hate your doctor, you find another doctor before you find a lawyer. This guy didn't sue Cameron or Foreman. He didn't even sue House. Something personal here, something you don't want us to know before your hearing. The guy didn't hate you before that meeting, he hated you after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So how's everything else? The girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Ah, you know... a lot of crying, some nightmares.  We'll be ok though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Girls are not going to be happy about leaving town though. They love that house, the yard, their friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Ever since the operation I've been on disability and there's the mortgage so… moving out of state somewhere cheaper. Anyways, thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I killed your sister. I misdiagnosed her ulcer. Killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Shut up man. She liked you, just--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was hung-over when she came back to see me. I'd been up half the night drinking, had a headache and I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Couldn't have cared less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think I'm lying? It's exactly what I told him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I killed his sister!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I ordered black coffee this morning and got cream. Everybody screws up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They didn't put poison in your coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What does it matter why? Is she less dead if I have a good excuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were depressed and distracted. I assumed you'd gotten a phone call from your stepmom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> This is Robert.  Umm… what did he die of?  That's impossible. I saw him two months ago, if he had lung cancer, he would have… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Kayla</speaker><content> Dr. Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good news is, both your parents are dead now so… no reason to screw up this bad again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's this interconnected network of computers, or interweb where you can--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How did you know to look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why didn't you tell me he was dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He asked me not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> So you just hung me out there to be blindsided.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah Chase, it was all my fault. Look, you got a choice. You can either tell the truth, hospital settles, family gets some money, they get to keep their house. Or you can keep up this lie, family gets punitive damages, they buy a jet, they move to Park Avenue, and you have to find another career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're not going to say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Is Chase telling the committee about his dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I wouldn't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're my client too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. And that's not going to change unless you leave this job. Or I do. So how do you deal with a coworker that you have feelings for - positive or negative. I don't want to end up like Chase, I don't want to get emotionally caught up and kill… you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It's not all negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Maybe you were right... maybe that is the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> I don't know.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Head Doc</speaker><content>After considering the testimonial and documentary evidence, this ad hoc committee in the matter of Kayla McGinley has reached a decision. Dr. Chase, your error resulted in a patient's death. You also lied, both to your superiors and the patient's brother. But taking into account the mitigating factor of your father's death, we've decided not to revoke your privileges. You'll receive one week's suspension and a letter in your permanent file.  Now as for Dr. House… there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action. And yet, there is enough in the record to be very troubled by your conduct,  including certain allegations of blackmail  from members of the transplant team and by your general refusal to meet with your patients. It should be noted that your patient's cancer was diagnosed as the result of a direct physical examination of---</content></utterance>
