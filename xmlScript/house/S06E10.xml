<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body, I know not everybody has got a body like you. Baaby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know, most people go for the hardwood or carpeting. I think guitars and garbage work just as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got the urge to play last night. Had to go all the way back to my apartment. Thought I'd save on future trips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm. That's very eco-friendly of you. How about keeping down on the noise pollution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> 6:33. You should be flossing by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not going to work today. I'm going hunting.  After I sleep in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ah. Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is it that time of year again? He's a self-important jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's a self-important jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Seems to be what I'm attracted to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't even know your name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Jim is short for James. Now go away, Lim. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Nice shot, Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. I nailed that tree.  Maple syrup for dinner. We should have got a guide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Oh, doesn't count as new adventure if you have someone holding your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>On the other hand, we are holding weapons and have no idea what we're doing. Fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>We need to sneak up on them. I read somewhere that the Native Americans say turkeys know what you're thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So I should stop thinking about German porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> No, no. That'll lure them closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>We're terrible at this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, at least it's cold and my new boots leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Well, it's almost time anyway. Did you bring the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>May 30, 2004, 10:07 a.m. Dr. Wilson informed me that if treatment didn't go well, my leukemia would give me only six more months to live. November 30, 2004, six months later, I didn't die. As long as I am alive, I will find new and exciting ways to thank you for giving me another year.  Now move very, very far away from there so that I can be sure and thank you again next year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> Thanks, Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> All right, let's see how many more turkeys we can miss. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yeah, this will work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>God. Sorry, I don't know what happened. I can't move my arm. Am I having a stroke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good news. Head CT doesn't show any signs of a stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>So he's gonna be okay, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I cannot believe how much you've grown up in five years.  She's... She's not Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Ashley, my girlfriend. New life, new adventures. Ashley, meet Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's good to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>So this arm thing, does that mean his leukemia's back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I checked blood counts and blood cell morphologies. Everything is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>So these blood tests, it means it's not cancer for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>He said I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>So what do you think it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hopefully something innocuous. There's a doctor I can speak to who's great...  who's great at diagnosing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Sorry, that cold sore, how long have you had that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>Um, two weeks. I'm sorry. I-I got the call. I didn't have time to cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>What is it, Jim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That cold sore is caused by a virus. Assuming you guys kiss, the virus could transfer, infect your spine, and cause the paralysis. It's a disease called Transverse Myelitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>And is that good news or bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's great news. I'll get you a room and start you on Acyclovir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I just had a House moment. Diagnosed Transverse Myelitis from a cold sore. How cool is that? Patients really eat that crap up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's why I'm loved.  What am I doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ultrasound is clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means he's definitely not pregnant, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No gall stones. Could be Diverticulitis.  Have you eaten any seeds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Juan</speaker><content> I'm joining you, Antonio Aguilar. We'll play in God's Mariachi band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Draw some blood.  The self-important jerk does not have Transverse Myelitis. He's got cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you even--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay. Maybe I paid the redhead down in records a few bucks to CC me on all your cases. A few patients die, you might get sad again. Make a speech that would end your career. Frankly, I'm stalking you for you.  How long does a simple blood draw take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Almost finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, when you're finished almost finishing it, test it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Juan</speaker><content>Mi estomago's ripped open by the hand of God. He spilled my blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Confusion. Delirium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why rule out the hand of God so fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your guy's low white count and right arm paralysis equals a recurrence of his leukemia. Simple math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did you look past the first page of the file? No AML cells anywhere. I did the blood smears myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's still cancer. You know how I know? He's got an oncologist for a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And your magical leukemia detector is more powerful than a flow cytometer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I look for zebras because other doctors rule out all the horses. In this case, you are those other doctors. You haven't earned a zebra. 100 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your problem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just give me the lactic acid level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>27.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The fact that you can't speak English is not an excuse for you not being humiliated by what I'm about to say. It's also not an excuse for you not telling us that you were a tennis pro. If you had, we wouldn't have wasted our time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fine. 100 bucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is Tucker settling in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Yeah. Already got his first dose of Acyclovir. And don't worry, I ordered his girlfriend the kiddy meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hoo-ah. Next patient on deck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content> Del Clinton, day six of chemo. You just missed the grandkids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Oh, that's all right. Last time they were here, they painted my tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're almost ready to go home. You feeling okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>I feel like I felt after the last four rounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>In oncology, familiar pain means all is well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>So that's good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.  I heard Jesse and Zeke were by earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sorry Del, I gotta run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>They--they're fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No game-winning hits? No aced report cards? No school plays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>I guess not. I thought you had to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Are you depressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>I have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You've had cancer for a long time. It's never stopped you from bragging about the grandkids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Del</speaker><content>I guess I'm feeling a little more down than usual. Can you give me something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. I don't want you to get alarmed, but sometimes depression can be a sign that something else is going on. I'm just gonna order a couple of extra tests. Okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>It's his foot now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>It's nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>It's not nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>I just started getting a little tingling feeling in my foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>Is that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Ashley, it's gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It might mean his foot fell asleep. It might mean nothing.  Could you give us a few minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>What--why can't you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Because you're making him nervous. Just give us a few minutes, okay, hon? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Does this mean that it's not the disease you thought it was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It means the medicine I gave you is not working. I just might have to hit it harder. I'm going to add Ribavirin to your treatment. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Jim, are you sure that this isn't a recurrence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So the brave face is just for Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>She's young. She's terrified. She's not really equipped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't worry. Once you've had cancer, recurrence is your biggest fear. I get it. I've looked at this thing every which way there is. That's not</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Can you call my daughter and ask her to come down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can't do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>She hasn't exactly been talking to me since I got together with Ashley. I'd really like her to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Exactly how serious does it have to be to justify you coming to see your father? No. I'm sorry. I just--I'd rather you regretted coming than regretted not coming. Thanks Emily. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How's Tucker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, well, he's made a mess of his personal life. But physically, I think he's gonna be fine. Transverse Myelitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What does House think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What is this? Is House my overseer now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, it's just not always a good idea for doctors to treat their friends, that's all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, House has got 100 bucks on cancer. So unless you want in</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Um, is Bonnie still a realtor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>As far as I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you mind if I call her? I'm, uh, looking for a new place. I'm moving in with Lucas. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> it wasn't the tennis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're moving in with Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're Bonnie's friend. You know how to reach her. And yet instead of calling her, you come and seek my permission. You want my blessing, and implicitly, House's blessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't need House's blessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>So when will he be able to move his arm again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Should be soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Started smoking again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>What--what does that mean? Is it bad that he's coughing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Hi, dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Hey</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> Melissa, hey.  I didn't know you were coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I was at Mom's house when Dr. Wilson called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>I can go if it's gonna be weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> No, no. Stay. It's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. He's okay. I'm not a big fan of this coughing though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>You must be Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>Hi.  Hey, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>Do you think this cold sore thing could've caused this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No. Whatever's causing this is affecting more than his nerves. I need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't you guys have a dying Mexican crooner to attend to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He isn't dying anymore. Found out he was on a popcorn diet. Eating ten bags of microwave popcorn a day. Huffing the fumes scarred his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow, that's... very strange. Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Performing his ritual "hiding from Cuddy to avoid getting a new case" dance. It's sort of a jazz-fusion type of thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's probably eating lunch in the morgue. I can page him to your office if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Actually... maybe it would be better if I talked to you guys alone. House and I have a bet about one of my patients. You guys mind making him 100 bucks poorer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>43-year-old male in remission from leukemia presents with left arm paralysis and trouble breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I assume House's money is on cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thanks. That's very helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Subdural hematoma would explain--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>CT ruled it out. I thought it was TM, so I started him on antivirals, but he got worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Bacterial infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Bacteria would move much faster than this. He'd be dead already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Could be fungal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Fungal infection would explain his breathing problem, but not his "unable to move his arm" problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Actually, if aspergillus fungus balls took root in his lungs and spread to his spine, it would explain both.  Thanks. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The treatment involves riddling the infected area with bb-sized pellets of antifungal meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>I assume you don't just load up the 12-gauge and pepper me with birdshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. We have a slightly more humane delivery system. But we do have to open you up. It is surgery. And like any operation, there are risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> What do you think, honey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>I-I don't know. I mean, is surgery really such a good idea? He just seems so sick. I just— you should do whatever you think is best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Is this the only way to go after this thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because of the rapid progression, I don't think we have time to test or try IVs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>And he's strong enough to endure anesthesia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Definitely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>I want you there during the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content> You gotta do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good. Dr. Chase will be in here soon to get you set for the OR.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's room for a surgery consult. And can you get me--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content> Uh, Mr. Koplovitz wants to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>He wanted to talk to his doctor, not his doctor's assistant. Oh, and House is looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What did you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>That you were in the clinic. I figure that gives you about ten minutes.  Here. Mr. Koplovitz's chart. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hello, Saul. I heard you were looking for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Saul</speaker><content>I'm very tired. But I can't sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Today's your lucky day. I happen to be a sleep specialist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Saul</speaker><content>Thanks, Doc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Nice hiding spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it's perfect. It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you. What did she want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She was checking up on Tucker thanks to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Like what? Something about you? Something you could interpret as being about you? An anagram maybe? It'd be great if you could play hide and seek somewhere else. My patient--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No problem. Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Tucker doesn't have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He doesn't have a ball of fungus in his lungs either. Next time you want to use my team, I suggest you at least leave a tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm late for surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Ah, your assistant said you'd be in here. I talked to Bonnie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Let's take this outside. Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. She found us this fantastic loft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I mean, it's not a loft really, it's just more urban. Not that I'm urban,</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Procedure should take about an hour. I'll be observing the entire time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Thanks. Maybe it'd be better if you stayed with Ashley. She's more scared than I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Well, she's... at her age... she's not supposed to be dealing with issues of life and death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Wasn't what I was planning when I went after her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why did you leave Melissa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>We got married young. We... I'm not sure. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's nothing to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why are you doing surgery when I need you finding me a new case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You don't want a new case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, right. Guess I'm here for Wilson. Obviously you didn't tell me that Cuddy was moving in with Lucas 'cause you were protecting me. Which is odd since I told you that I'm fine with their relationship. So obviously, you question one of those assumptions or you have an issue with logic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, you're fine with them dating. But moving in together is a whole other level of commitment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> This is the 21st century, Wilson. I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship could one day lead to fornication. Although, the fact that she wants to buy a loft, could actually mean that their relationship is not as serious as I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, for God's sake, House, don't do this to yourself. It's a loft. It has no deeper meaning than open-space living arrangement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you bought into her diatribe about rediscovering her lost city girl roots. And two bedrooms. It just reeks of commitment issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Or she has a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis. This is her version of a two-seat convertible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yep, clearly you're fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Wilson, he's got global lung damage. Means it's not fungal. It's PCP pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. Obviously something is knocking out his immune system. Three options. HIV, acquired SCID, or my personal favorite, cancer. I'm sure you'll test for all three. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>62-year-old African-American man with lymphoma now in remission. I did a CT and found a small lesion on the upper lobe of his left lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>During a routine follow-up, I realized the patient was depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thanks. The treatment indicate--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's a conference room, with glass walls. You thought I'd be alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your patient has cancer. Not that guy. Who probably also has cancer. And he's probably also your buddy.  Thought you'd want to know. And you owe me 100 bucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A.L.L.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content> So, it is a recurrence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. It's different. It's a second leukemia. Probably caused by the chemotherapy we gave him five years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>That's why you didn't see it. Maybe they can rename it ironic leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is not the end. Tests show that the cancer is limited to your brain. That's good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>How can cancer in his head be good news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The blood-brain barrier separates the blood in your head from the blood in your body. Keeps the cancer bottled up. We can go for a cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>So give me the numbers. What are we looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>90% chance of cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Really. What if we're in the 10%?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Steady decline. But six months of a good quality life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Does he have to go through another bone marrow transplant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. Chemotherapy. We can go at this with drugs alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>When do we get started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We begin by surgically planting a shunt so we can get the drugs directly into your brain. I already booked the OR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>You're the only one who can make cancer sound like good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We get it out of your head and you walk out of here, paralysis gone and cancer-free.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We also need you to sign a health care proxy. If something goes wrong in surgery, someone needs to be appointed to make decisions for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>What are the chances of that happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Very remote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>I think maybe Melissa should be my proxy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Coming through. House got a new case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Revised OR schedule. Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you. It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, your guy's not bleeding out of his eyes either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your case is no more urgent than mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, but you're way more patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's okay. You can talk about the--the paperwork in the prep area.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>You trust her more than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content> About this, yes.  You've been through the good stuff, but Melissa's been to hell and back with me. She gives me the best shot of getting through this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Ashley</speaker><content>You still love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Don't be silly. I love you. Please... don't make this into more than it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Can you feel this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How about here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Where is everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Melissa and Emily went downstairs to get some breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ashley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>She had work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I thought she was off today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Well, she didn't really have work to do. She was just pissed so she pretended to have work to do. I let her pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. Move your fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> The chemo's not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Does that mean it's not cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. It means the chemo from your first round of treatment has made the leukemia resistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>So I'm in the 10% that don't get cured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We just removed a screw from a guy's lung. And the weird thing is he didn't get better. Any idea what that means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It means you're not listening to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. It means I'm ignoring you to make a point. There is a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The problem with that technique is I have no idea what point you're making.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to. Doubling your patient's chemo dose is stupid. Damn, now it's explicit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It could swamp out the resistance of the cancer cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fact that it theoretically should work doesn't make it any less stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course it does. It's exactly what you would do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm me. You're you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And a table is a table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And chemo is poison. And double chemo is double poison. And I can handle it when things go wrong. You can't. And things could go very,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I can handle it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Sounds pretty dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>What do you think, Mel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content> I think you should call Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>You're my family. I'm sorry I forgot that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I think that you should try, whatever could keep you with us longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>I can move them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>What is it, Jim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm gonna need to run some tests. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Intraepidermal superficial bullae. Could be pemphigus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or it could be from the fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Either way, he's dead.  We can't stop the oozing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't care. I'm here because  it's 1:15 and Wilson started testing at 12:45. Which means...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The cancer's gone. But over half his hepatocytes are dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>In only 24 hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> He needs a new liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look on the bright side. You can publish the results of this case study. No one will ever double the dose again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The double dose of chemo got rid of your cancer. But, it also trashed your liver. If I don't find you a new liver, you've only got about 24 hours left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So what do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your father's been moved to the top of the transplant list. But, all we really can do is wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>That's it? We wait? Tell me something that I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Mel. You and Emily don't match Tuck's blood type. And neither does Ashley. So a live liver donation is out. The best thing to do is just what you've been doing. Be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hope he already told you that you're gonna die. 'Cause it's gonna make what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, I know it's raining out there in the hallway, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was just in the ER, testing my patient for autonomic dysfunction. It's the only department with a shower big enough for the whole team, plus the cardiac monitors, plus me. Anyway, relevant part, we're just wheeling the guy out, trauma came in. Motorcycle versus semi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bad for the motorcycle. Good for your liver. Blood type's a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why wasn't I paged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because there's a problem. No organ donor card. Dead guy's sister</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>20 minutes away. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you get the call that your brother's dead and then run out the door? "Oh--oh--oh, that reminds me, I-I had dry cleaning to pick up."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did Cuddy buy the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not yet. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just making conversation. Yours was getting boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What are you planning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not planning anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And I don't believe you. How are you gonna punish her for dating Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, now this conversation is getting boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you really okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No! I am not okay. Not even close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow. Okay. See, that's very adult of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it isn't. It's just me accepting the fact that there's nothing I can do and moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Which is, I think, the definition of adulthood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Showtime. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Aikoa Tanaka</speaker><content>I didn't speak to him for years. But when my parents died, at their funeral, we made peace. Our parents must've blessed it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Aikoa Tanaka</speaker><content>They wanted us to be friends. Our relationship wasn't strong, but it was growing. If I allow you to defile his body, it will destroy that bond. The Itai will be harmed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It will save my patient's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What if I told you that he wasn't dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Aikoa Tanaka</speaker><content>Are you saying my brother is still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm saying you're being an idiot. But I don't have time to talk you out of your religion so I'm stuck with giving you a technicality that will let you justify</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Aikoa Tanaka</speaker><content>Then I'm not defiling a dead body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The last generous act of a living person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House, it's too late. The liver’s started to degrade. It's no longer viable for transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well played. Religion just killed another person.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>It's not fair, Jim. You just helped me get my family back together. I'm--I'm not ready.  I would've had six more months with them if you hadn't given me that extra chemo. Now I have less than one day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sorry. We knew the risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>I don't want to lose them again. I can't lose them again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's nothing more we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>Five years ago, when I needed a transfusion, you used your own blood. We have the same type. Which means you can give me a part of your liver.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Tucker</speaker><content>You're my friend. Should I die because you're also my doctor?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone's cranky.  And late. Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> getting a drink. What--why are all my frozen dinners thawing on the counter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why'd you go out drinking alone when you got such great company here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Tucker wants me to donate a lobe of my liver to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you were out drinking. So you're actually considering this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your mouth says no, but your pathetic attempt at a deflection has guilt written all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's my fault. It is my fault! I gave him too much chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You cured his cancer.</content></utterance>
