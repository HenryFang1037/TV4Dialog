<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Take your time. You mind if I get a drink of water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>No, not at all. Help yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content> Not exactly beach reading, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Do you understand any of that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>Well, most of these I can get through, But, uh, that one? Can't get past the dust jacket. Where's Ted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Laid off. Company's going with per diem workers. You know, you don't have to pay overtime, health insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>Wow. that sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I don't mind. really, I'm not a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.  Uh... If I could just get you to sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>Right. um... Hang on one second. I want to show you something.  You're gonna laugh, but, uh, I swear, this guy James Sidas looks exactly like you. Wait, hang on a second.  This guy is you.  I saw a profile Nova did on you. You're, like, the youngest guy to ever graduate MIT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Standards were lower back then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>You got an IQ of 178. Published three books and 35 papers all before the age of 18?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, sorry, I really need to get going. So if I could just get you to sign off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>All right. I'll trade you. I'll sign if you'll sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I'm not that guy anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Beringer</speaker><content>Come on, man. This is the most exciting thing that's happened in this place in years.  Come on. Don't be like that. I'm paying you a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>It's... It's not that, um... My hand's not working.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I got it. It's all right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thanks. Although I should make it clear that for two bucks all you get is top half, over the clothes. Any plans for turkey day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Go to my sister's for dinner. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just making pleasant conversation. I've heard tell of folks doing such.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How 'bout we talk about this?  15-year-old. Recurring migraines and blurred vision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. There's no point in putting a band together if we're not gonna play any gigs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hold on. Take this instead.  I was expecting more resistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free.  Enjoy your drumstick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why wouldn't I be? Got all my starters back, plus a couple of first-class free agents. I feel like Mike Tomlin.  Probably not as much as you do, but you get the idea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ataxia and anemia could be viral. Maybe West Nile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No fever, lymph glands were normal. Anybody seen Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hyperbilirubinemia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, like that's a real thing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Whites can get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on. We get the tennis elbow and all the money. Let them have sickle cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>TTP's a better fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's right.  What, you thought I wouldn't agree with him? Ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't agree with him. That's why he dumped you. Oh, sorry. It was mutual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're cool, okay? Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sounds passionate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> TTP makes sense to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not to me. What if he had a history of –</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Can you cure it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>TTP isn't completely curable, but the symptoms are manageable with the proper treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Is this the treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, first we need to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>But he's gonna get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Honey, that's what she's saying. I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I'm gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're sure everything was fine before? Given your educational background, you'd think you could at least find a job with a medical plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>We have money. Don't worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not that, it's just – I want to make sure we have all the information we should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>My husband wouldn't lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>It's okay, baby. He's just doing his job. He just wants to make sure I’m not a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or hiding a history of mental illness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I work as a courier because I want to. It's easy. I don't have to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's too hard to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>No, just unpleasant. No matter what I did, it really wasn't good enough. Then I met Dara. She didn't care how smart I was or what I might accomplish in the future. It was the first time in my life that I was really happy. So I decided I would rather be happy than smart.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You all right? Sorry. I know you're not okay. I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> She left. Went back to Chicago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Any chance of reconciliation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nope. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sure you don't want to grab a drink after work? Figured we could talk about the perils of dating doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I wasn't dating Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I know what you're doing and I appreciate it, but I've got it under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's what you said about the Dibala incident. And obviously you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And talking about it obviously made things so much better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Didn't you think there was something weird about that guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not really. In fact, he seemed pretty normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's my point. Guys with IQs off the chart are usually completely... abnormal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Speaking of House, why'd you come back? I mean, you must've taken a major pay cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Life's too short to worry about money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your wife feel the same way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's happy to cut back on some things... like sex. Why'd you come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why wouldn't I? Like Foreman said, nobody's angry. Nobody's hurt.  Schistocytes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That means TTP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Which is what we thought it'd be. Remember? This is a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is an easy thing. And House doesn't take cases that are easy, which means it's not TTP, and he wants to see how long it takes us to catch up to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Schistocytes suggest TTP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good. Now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Normally, we'd try plasmapheresis, but the patient has an albumin colloid allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Man in stall</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you know where he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Man in stall</speaker><content>Not in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're sure you want us to take out his spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that what a "splenectomy" is? I thought it was an ice cream treat. Yuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So you do really think he has TTP? You're not just testing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, like I have time for games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So why did you really take this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Missed you at breakfast this morning. And lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I had a dentist appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know where Cuddy's sister lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You see. This is why I don't answer your urgent pages. Because they're not urgent pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've decided what I’m gonna do about Cuddy and Lucas. I'm going to break them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's given me a purpose in life, a goal, a raison d’être.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Albeit a selfish, mean-spirited, childish raison. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ehhhhh. I think of it more as benevolent. There's only two possible outcomes for their relationship. They split, or they stay together forever. If it's split, then the sooner it happens the better for everyone. If it's stay, then my meddling won't matter.  In fact, if they survive it, it might even make their bond stronger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> How you manage to elevate your narcissism to beneficence is masterful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I’ve decided to do it at Thanksgiving dinner. Just 'cause I’m sentimental. Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have no idea where Cuddy's sister lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ask and thou shalt receive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can't honestly think I would help you with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not help me, help Cuddy, remember? If you don't get it, I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Happy holiday. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Huh. Looks great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>So he's all better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Probably be on some long-term meds, and he's about ten ounces lighter. Other than that, won't even know it's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Did you hear that, honey? You're gonna be just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>When can I get out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everything checks out, less than a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Good, 'cause those boxes aren't gonna deliver colors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Colors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Green... and orange... and ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Chewing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Jimmy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Shirt...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He's stroking. Call the cath lab now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blood flow's restored.  There appears to be no permanent damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thank God he's still got his appendix and tonsils. So what looks like TTP, acts like TTP, tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>CNS vasculitis. Explains ataxia, and anemia, maybe the stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>CT would've picked up something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Greg House, a friend of your sister, Lisa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be DIC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lisa Cuddy. Sorry. Wrong number. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You gonna ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm sure he's got a perfectly logical explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't be DIC. No hemorrhaging. And I’m calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within a 100-mile radius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> See? Completely reasonable.  Acquired pancytopenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>WBC's normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, Julia. You're, uh – you're Lisa's sister, right? You sure? 'Cause you are number 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe she got married and changed her name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Otis Campbell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Probably kept her first name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The mnemonic for toxins. O for organophosphates, T for tricyclics, I for insulin…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Except the tox screen was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Standard tox screen. Unstandard toxins don't show up on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen; you two search his home. Otis Campbell's got to be hiding somewhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Smartest guy in the world, and this is the best he can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe he's doing what he loves. Delivering boxes was a childhood dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Soda, processed cheese, marshmallow spread. Nothing in here is capable of going bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Ibuprofen, eye drops, cough syrup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You want to come over for Thanksgiving dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You never asked me over before. Why now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I just never thought of it. But now that we're both on the team...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And my wife left me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is that a bad reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. But, uh, I’m okay. On both the food and friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mice. Leptospirosis could explain the ataxia and the anemia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But not without a fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You have someone to talk to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What, you want names?  Look, you lost a friend. I get it. But I’m not Kutner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Good, 'cause Kutner never used to come over for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I'm gonna pretend there's something interesting over here so you'll shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Actually, there is. He's got sketches of atomic structure. This one's full of math proofs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They're all old. Nothing since '96.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This isn't some homework assignment his parents forced on him. This is passion. Why would he want to stop doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Marriage destroyed his soul.  Ooh. Or maybe it was just the booze.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So which one of us slipped through the wormhole into an alternate dimension?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have always loved to travel. And paint. Lucky number seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House... I know you're trying to be nice, but I also know you're doing it because you have an agenda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Sexy and smart. Lucas is a lucky guy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So guy's a brainiac, and his secret drug of choice is booze? That's kind of pedestrian, don't you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Talk to him. He's a pedestrian guy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Year's. On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So why lie to your wife about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Because it's not important. What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>That you drink every day by yourself?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Everything else is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So it was a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Unless… it's not his liver that's elevating his albumen, it's his kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Renal failure. Explains the anemia. If he developed hyperkalemia, that would explain the ataxia. But the stroke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ischemic encephalopathy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I just talked to him. And he said he thought it'd be better if we stopped seeing each other. Said he didn't realize how much there still was between you and me, and he didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dextromethorphan. As in cough syrup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He wasn't taking it for his cough. It's cheap, available at your corner drug store, and taken in high doses, it's a dumb drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Dumb drug. Well, he obviously hasn't –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's smart compared to you. He's a moron compared to what he was. "Robotripping." Lowers the IQ. It also causes brain damage. Unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol. About one drink per day. He wasn't abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally. He was abusing the cough meds, and taking the booze medicinally. Bravo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Dara</speaker><content>Why would you do that? If you had a – a gift, why would you just throw it away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I didn't throw it away. I just turned it down a little. When my brain was on low, everything didn't seem so miserable anymore. Life was bearable.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms. Even – oh, sweet irony – your cough. Whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal. We get all traces of it out of your system. You'll be the unhappiest little courier in no time. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I told you. Do you know what the difference between her IQ and mine is? 91 points.  In relation, she's closer to a gibbon than she is to me. Having sex with her would be an act of bestiality.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is it really? 'Cause you seem a lot more interested in asking questions than answering them. Handwriting on your medical records is obviously not a doctor's 'cause I can almost read it. And when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse.

<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think they've given you enough already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, at least they're trying. They're not just sitting there like roadkill. Give me something. Give me something, or I'll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Against the ottoman I tripped over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Against Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm pretty sure the ottoman was acting alone. You free for dinner this weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>At least three other people saw him do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mass hysteria. Either night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can't have doctors punching each other out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God, who got punched?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And more importantly, for Chase's sake, I need to know if he's able to handle himself or if I should be getting him some help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase couldn't have punched anyone. He was with me when I tripped over the ottoman. If you're not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not doing this, House. It's not fun anymore. Just do your job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>What happened to your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang. You're a computer. I’m gonna feed you data, and you analyze it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>What, are you gonna feed me 20 years of medical knowledge too? It's not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. But I don't have anyone else to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>It's lonely, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Then you're not that smart. You ever tried to kill yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>I did. 12 years ago I jumped off the top of my eight-story building into a dumpster bin the day before pickup. I broke my collarbone, my leg, and three ribs. When I was in the hospital they put me on narcotics and suddenly everything was just better. I didn't feel isolated or lonely. That's where I met my wife. She was so happy. And dumb. And I was... smart... and miserable. You tell me who the genius is. I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head, and I knew I wanted to stay that way forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content> Easier on your conscience if I die an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's a conscience?  Which ribs... did you break in the fall? They on the left side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Yeah, bottom three. That was 12 years ago.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gets absorbed by the spleen. Unless he doesn't have one. In which case it's absorbed by the liver, and fries that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're killing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think I opened him up and didn't take out his spleen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All organs do look kind of the same – red and squishy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Accessory spleens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay, that is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>12 years, eight stories, and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen. Bits of it split off, circulated through his bloodstream until they landed and attached somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So it is TTP. I just didn't remove... all of his spleens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>16 splenectomies. Pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I can outrun you.  Sorry about the nose. And the eye. And the, uh... eyebrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guess I deserved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, if I thought that, I wouldn't be apologizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your fist slipped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you busted my nose to keep people off your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Making people even more worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe. But at least they're not talking to me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fair enough.</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't be so grateful. You'll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Well, uh, thanks for our talk. It's been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what're you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Go back to my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>The one that has my wife in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Robotripping. How's she feel about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Sidas</speaker><content>Well, she doesn't have to know. It's worked for 12 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Tell your brain I said good-bye.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just one right hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You were right. I told him we need to lay down some ground rules, got a little heated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's not what I meant. Is he okay? Are you gonna be fired? Arrested?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How's your nose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's okay. Does your kid like animals? I got tickets to that holiday carnival. I hear they have a nice petting zoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I think I was pretty clear before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't mean with me. Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're not fake. I didn't steal them. One of the nurses was selling 'em for her kid's scout trip. I know it doesn't make things right between us, but I just wanted to do something nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't want them.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of course. Windtalker code for "we never split up." House, she told you multiple times she wants nothing to do with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wasn't gonna be there. She just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Either that or she didn't want to appease you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These weren't reparations. Just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down. They didn't break up. She just wanted me to think that so I’d back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Dare I ask what you're gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing. I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together. They didn't break up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And you're okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is what it is.</content></utterance>
