<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>JANIE</speaker><content>He got in another fight and I can't get his nose to stop bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>You have to apply much more pressure than that.   You had to do this today. I got office hours, supposed to have dinner with the Dean, you just can't lash out whenever you get angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>He said I smelt like a monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Well you do. You can't refuse to take a bath and then hit kids who tell you that you smell.  Damn. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>JANIE</speaker><content>Don't you think we should call 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>No, this isn't his first nosebleed. He'll be fine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content> When was this fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>JANIE</speaker><content>Over 10 minutes ago.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content> Maybe you should make that call.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It's calcified and she's hypertensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then get her into surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>She already is in surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Tricky procedure. It's going to take all night.  Sleep tight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> No congenital defects, no health problems, but her heart is strangling itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Fascinating, but since the pathology on the pericardium won't be back until after they remove it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Get started on her blood, you can test for viral infections, bacteria... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Round up the usual suspects. Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis... Heck, go wild, do all the osises.   All taken care of, sleep tight. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>This thing is already all around her heart. If it gets into the muscle she's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Best bet's Coxsackie virus, Parvovirus B19, CMV...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Bacterial infection is more likely to turn constrictive. It could be TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Right. Forgot about the part where she did time in Russian gulag. Her hematocritâ€™s elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Few extra blood cells means nothing. She's probably just dehydrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yes and I could assume 3 or 4 things to fit my theory too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>She's sick. She obviously hasn't been drinking enough...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Enough!  I take it you two aren't sleeping together anymore? We do what House said. We test for everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Good.  Then I can go home. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Since when does we not include you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Well House is going to call us all idiots anyway. Might as well be a well-rested idiot. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You guys are idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Why? Because we stayed up all night doing exactly what you told us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No. Because you stayed up all night doing exactly what I told you to do and have nothing to show for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We eliminated dozens of wrong answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I asked you what 2 + 2 equals and a day later you tell me not 25.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>The pathology report just got filed. Found granulomas in Lucy's pericardium.  Could be a case of fungal infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nice work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He went home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Work smart, not hard.  Find out which fungus, biopsy a lymph node. Take employee of the month with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I would rather Foreman...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content> I don't want any more shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Jasper.  Look at me, Goosy. Squeeze my hand, ok? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>This will tell us why you are sick so we can make you all better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content> Where would she pick up a fungus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Anywhere moist. Around a pool, locker room, public shower...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>She doesn't have any gym or swim classes, she doesn't even like to play with kids outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You haven't taken any trips, gone anywhere new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>It's been hard to get away, since their mom...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>Our mom's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Last year, brain cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>You're going to stick that thing in her arm? Cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>The cool part is, your sister won't feel a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>Nice necklace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>You like video games?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Love them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>That should do it. You OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>I want my bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Are you being silly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>I didn't know which one to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content> What do you mean?  What's happening?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, what does the double vision tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Slit lamp revealed the eyeâ€™s anterior chamber is swollen, uveitis, means it's not a post op effect and it's not neurological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It's not fungal either, lymph node biopsy was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So we're back to square one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>One and a half. We've eliminated two more conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes, 2+2 doesn't equal 12 or 16 either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Vision issues plus screwy heart equals some type of autoimmune. Lupus and Kawasakis are the most common in a 6-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Yeah, tough to find a 6 year old who doesn't have Lupus or Kawasakis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you look at her knees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Those knobby things in the middle of her legs, any scars or scabs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>What does that have to do with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well most 6 year olds hurt themselves, a lot. Crash their bikes, climb trees, bungee jump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Dad said she doesn't like to run around outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because running around outside hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>She didn't mention anything about...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Most 6 year olds are not familiar with the phrase 'my joints feel inflamed'. So, 2+2 equals?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. We're checking her ANA to confirm and giving her steroids to fix her vision. Some idiot gave me two tickets for a play tonight. Saved his life, apparently worth 186 dollars.   Sorry, had to take a leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Oh I didn't know you were seeing a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's an exam room. What did you think I was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What you usually do - hiding from Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well it'd be stupid to do it in here. There's a patient in here.   You been drinking more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>Ah no, I, I....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Guy's peeing all the time. Play. Interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Sure, want me to pick you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You said two tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You thought this was a date?  Any other symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>My stomach hurts, I have back pain and muscle aches, I feel dizzy  and I have trouble concentrating sometimes in class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I really shouldn't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You want the tickets or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Why don't you want to go with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's a play. Dudes only go to plays if they're dragged by women they're hoping to see naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So why are you giving them to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Maybe there's someone you want to see naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> All right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Any fever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Anything in your pee other than pee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm going to need a urine sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah that last one wasn't a question. You might have diabetes...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>I can't pee in public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We have bathrooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>I can't pee in public bathrooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Where can you pee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>I only live a few miles from here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>I though arthritis was for old people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>JRA is an autoimmune disease. Her body is attacking itself, causing inflammation in the joints, her eyes and her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Is it treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It can be crippling, but it can also go into complete remission. The good thing is we caught it early. It gives her the best chance to have a positive outcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>Don't get up, Goosy, your stitches. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> She's having a stroke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The stroke was caused by a clot in her middle cerebral artery. Started her on TPA. It should dissolve the clot and hopefully prevent brain damage, but we wont know for sure until she regains consciousness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Or she has another stroke. Arthritis, heart disease, why can't this kid act her age?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>JRA doesn't affect the blood, means the clotâ€™s a symptom of something else. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>It's a symptom of polycythemia, she's fully hydrated and her blood's still thicker than pancake batter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well thick blood explains the stroke, could also have caused an autoimmune response, which would explain the JRA kicking into gear. But what explains the thick blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Lack of oxygen, forces the body to over produce red cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What explains the lack of oxygen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Carbon monoxide fumes, cigarette smoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Doubt our patient's a smoker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Dad could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> He says he's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hey! Don't make me turn the hose on you two. Chase is right. You two go check the house, see if Dad's a closet Marlboro man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You're intentionally punishing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>By making you do your job? Does seem kind of cruel doesn't it? Take along a carbon monoxide detector to check for leaks and you  start her on hydroxyurea to control her red blood cell production. Take out a Merck Manual, medieval edition, tell you how to drain a pint or two so she doesn't clot again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>Dr. Cameron!  I got you flowers, for helping my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> That's so sweet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Does your dad know you're down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Congratulations on your bundle of joy.  Something you forgot to tell me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> You should take these back to where you found them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>JASPER</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Excuse me? Can you make sure these flowers and this kid both get back to where they belong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>SECURITY GUARD</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Wait. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>So you're just draining blood from her? You're not testing it, you're not fixing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Your daughters vascular system is engorged with blood, draining some reduces the chances of another stroke. We're also starting her on a drug that suppresses the production of red cells so we don't have to keep doing this. Good chance she'll make a full recovery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>DERAN</speaker><content>She hasn't spoken yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Give her time.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Oven's a long shot. You'd smell the gas long before anyone got sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Yeah right, House loves it when we skip something because it's a long shot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Why did you take the flower? Why'd you kiss him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He did something sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He STOLE flowers!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You're trying to make me jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Yeah, I want you to profess your love for me. Oh wait, you already did that and it caused me to end our relationship. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You're enabling a thief.  And a delinquent!  Letters from school, fights, detentions, a parent conference. Oh, I know, I know, bad boys are hard to resist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>It's a crush. It's harmless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It's never harmless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>So I'm learning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> So this is us now? We snipe at each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I'm not sniping I'm looking for a vent. Her room's directly above the garage. There's all sorts of CO sources down there.  I found a vent, I think there's something in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> This isn't right. You dumped me, you don't get to be mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>We had a really good thing. You broke the rules, I'm angry. I'll get over it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>She's being abused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>A bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse. Kids get hurt all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>That amount of blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Oh crap. You two are agreeing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Father's overwhelmed, hectic job, his wife passed away last year. He could easily be taking it out on the kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Or she had a nosebleed and grabbed a t-shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>She's so ashamed of a nosebleed she has to hide the evidence in a vent under her bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>She's socially isolated, the brother's always in trouble its classic signs...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>But no physical signs. No marks on her body, no bruises at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> What if it's sexual? We should call social services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well this sucks. Either it's abuse or it's not abuse. Which means either it's a symptom or it's completely irrelevant. Either way we have to waste half a day figuring out which. Full physical exam. Look for bruises we may have missed, check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We can't do a vaginal exam on a 6 year old without the Dad's consent and if he's abusing her he'll never say yes.</content></utterance>
