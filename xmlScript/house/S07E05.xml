<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I've been in labor for over a dozen hours, Justine, and I have to yell. I thought you were gonna miss the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Mom, it's a three-hour drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>That's why I called you yesterday after my water broke. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I'm sorry. A partner just dropped a brief on my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Yeah, right. I remember what it's like, but family comes first. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>All right, come on. We're doing good here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Get this. This is what I wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Gross…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>You're crowning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Are you getting — getting this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Kind of. Well, not the actual vagina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>It's your baby sister!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>It's my mother's vagina!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Aaaaah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Aaah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Is something wrong?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>What are they saying?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cancel your dinner plans.  Short on medical history. She's only eight hours old. What she's not short on is doctors. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to solve her breathing problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Immature lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Full term, and they gave her surfactant. Looks like they're fully developed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need you a minute. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Silent reading time till I get back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My nanny called. Her daughter has a dance recital tonight. She can't work late.  And I have a board meeting tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That's a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My mother can't come. She has a cooking class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you've really got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> If only there were... some mature adult in my life who could pinch hit in emergencies like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Love to, but I'm catching up on my back issues of Nudist Circus. You should see what the fat lady's got under her big top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>All I need is a warm body. She'll be asleep the entire time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got a sick baby here who needs me. Yours is healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You could deal with your team by phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How about a little something extra when you get home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not bargaining sex for babysitting. Besides, you owe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sex! I still don't see a female doctor in that room. It's making me very unhappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Be at my place at 7:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The sperm donor card from the father did note a history of asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if her lung problems are not coming from her lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her heart looks fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her liver enzymes are elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins. Specifically the ones that keep your plasma inside your blood vessels and outside your lungs. Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath to keep the entire ward up all night.  Foreman... you need to stay after school.  I apparently need to apologize. Last week, I should not have gone over your head and allowed Chase to hire a new team member. So go hire someone who liked The Bridges of Madison County.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Do you want me to hire a white girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go find a woman, and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This'll be quick. I've been interviewing people all week. I have it narrowed down to two candidates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, narrow it down to one before Cuddy starts withholding sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Uh, she hasn't said anything to me about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said, wipe the grin. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm thirsty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your mommy says no, 'cause she's mean.  If it was up to me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Juice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Go back to bed.  I said bed! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson! Hey.  You up for a boys' night in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Believe it or not, breathing problems can be caused by a liver problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Then what's wrong with her liver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Probably an abscess. If we find it with the ultrasound, we can drain it, make her better. You'll be able to take her home by the end of the week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Is she bleeding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's oozing from her IV site. It's a symptom of liver failure. It's what we would expect to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Dr. Cheng, we might need a unit of blood over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Echogenic area in the liver. Can you make it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Doesn't seem to have the thick walls you'd expect from an abscess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lift her left shoulder so we can get a better look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Oh, can I do it? I haven't been able to hold her yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Can I at least donate blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's definitely not an abscess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It looks like dilated bile ducts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>What does that mean? Can I still take her home soon? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You were right about the liver. On ultrasound, we found intrahepatic dilated bile ducts. Extrahepatic ducts were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.  Are... you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just talking in a soothing voice. Not for your benefit.  Why? Is it turning you on? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, there's someone here I need you to meet. I just hired Dr. Christina Fraser. She's a board certified—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.  You're fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House... you're kidding, right? I've done my due diligence. She's the best there is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You had the misfortune to be the lesson that Foreman is learning. That whooshing sound is the air being let out of his ego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You are such an ass, House. You could have made the same point without crushing the hopes of a young doctor who was actually excited to have this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I'm not sure I could have.  I think you give me far too much credit. Taub...  it's your turn to find a young doctor who's actually excited to have this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not until you or she earns it.  Dilated bile ducts could be congenital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That means that it's a stricture in the ducts themselves. Caroli's syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, open her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Surgery?  This is a newborn with liver failure. She's oozing blood from every puncture site. It's insanely risky to open her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You told me you gave them your credit card...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you were dumb enough to believe me.  Cuddy'll be back in an hour and ten minutes... I'll be back in an hour and five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Ohhh, no, you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, yes, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You're not gonna leave the kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I am.  'Cause unlike you, I don't have a conscience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> And unlike you, I'm not having sex with Cuddy, so I actually can leave. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're not gonna leave a two-year-old unattended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. I'm leaving her with you. A responsible adult. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Better get back in there. Kid's all alone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not my problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, since, objectively, you care more about leaving a child alone than I do, it kind of is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Objectively, since I never accepted this responsibility, it kind of isn't. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> True, and yet it is. Because you're you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're not gonna leave. You can't. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Fine. You're right.  You know what I can do? I can go in there and call a babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour, then call Cuddy and tell her who's watching her kid and why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'll stay if you stay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> ...We were gone two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What have you got there, sweetie? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Come on now, spit it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Come on, sweetie. Open.  Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah. Bah bah bah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Open...  Ow! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Rachel... how many coins did you eat? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Isolating the common bile duct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And mobilizing the distal end for cannulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP is down to 50 systolic. You've got to stop the cannulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I haven't started yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Hit her with a bolus of phenylephrine. That should buy us enough time to get in and dilate those bile ducts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP is rising. 70 systolic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Nice. I'm in the common bile duct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Advancing past the cystic duct. No strictures or blockages so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP is dropping again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Another bolus of phenylephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>She can't take more. The first bolus is still in effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was barely in.This doesn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The liver problem alone is not gonna mess with the baby's BP. Whatever this is, it's got to be affecting her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Heart plus the liver. Could be tuberous sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or it could be a vascular malformation in the liver, causing both problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So what do you guys think of Dr. Cheng?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Best treatment for a vascular malformation is surgery. And I think your wife thinks you shouldn't think anything of Dr. Cheng.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No surgery. A newborn baby can't handle another trip to the O.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I didn't mean think-think. I meant think as a... potential hire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if we started the baby on steroids an anti-angiogenesis agent, and dopamine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could work just as well as surgery. Snap those bad blood vessels shut. I'll call House to get approval. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So, what was that shrug? A "Dr.-Cheng-could-work" shrug? Or a "House-is-gonna-crush-you-for-even-considering-her" shrug?  ...You suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House is gonna hate anyone we hire, because he doesn't want to hire  ...anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So you think I should abstain? Just give the decision back to him? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then he'll just mock you for being a wuss. You're screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Unless... House feels like hiring her is his idea...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still not answering. We should just start the treatment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay... you ordered the moo shoo pork... and the orange cashew chicken, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, he could have shortchanged you. Fridge magnet's not getting anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> That's because it's a fridge magnet! Unless she swallowed a Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really?  I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right?  I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out. She'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Absolutely.  Unless it gets stuck in her intestine and causes a blockage, which could kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you don't tell Cuddy, I will go out there and tell her myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah? What are you gonna tell her? Are you gonna tell her that... you left coins out?  And you left her child unsupervised?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content> You're telling me to do the right thing while climbing out a window!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Shh! Shh shh shh shh! Tell her! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Did she wake up at all? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>...One time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> That's not like her... is she all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's fine.  How about I stay the night? Then you can really thank me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have to get up early. You won't be able to sleep in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a deep sleeper. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Said she was going downstairs for a few minutes. A few hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So... you two are close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Well, it's been getting better, actually. At least she's here in the building. That's pretty supportive for her.  What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's pinker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Is that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's good. ...That's very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Was that her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Can I hold her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think it's long overdue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Oh!  Ohh... My first time... Finally...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Technically, it's your second time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content> I didn't mean—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I know, mom. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Looks like it was a vascular malformation. The Grogan baby is better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content> She moved. They always move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> ...It is a good job.  Diagnostics. Solve a mystery, save a life. But I suppose you're pretty attached to pediatrics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content> I'm sorry, Ms. Young, but I'm gonna have to ask you to restrain your daughter.  Now the mom's not gonna want to do it, because she'd rather I just keep blasting her daughter with radiation...  You're telling me... that there's an opening in House's department?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Would you be interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>No more kids, no more parents. One case at a time instead of seventeen?  Set up the interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's possible you won't need to interview. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, sorry, I'm just... new to all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You want me to reset the alarm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> God, no. Case is under control. I'm sleeping in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your boss must really like you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And I assume, since you still think we actually did the surgery, you haven't checked your messages in eight hours. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I believe this is what your people term a "poopy call".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Uh, the word is "booty".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I don't know what you're doing, but this is a poopy call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?! I know about the Jew, the black, and the croc-hunter, but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Dr. Cheng... is the NICU attending on the case. And she's not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She spotted a vascular malformation in the baby's liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good call... Except for everything you just said. There's no way that our patient has a vascular malformation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And you can tell that from the vast amount of information you've gleaned from not being here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't need to be there to remember that the patient's A.L.T.s were three times normal. The baby's liver damage is far too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>In fairness, it wasn't completely her idea. More of a Foreman kinda thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then you're an even bigger idiot for trying to cover for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, we treated for a vascular malformation, and she got better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, she didn't. Call me when she crashes again. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I'm just... not used to seeing such emotion coming from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I just gave birth. I'm, like, one big vat of hormones right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>It's not just the hormones, mom! You're different with her. It's okay. It's good. It's just... I can't help thinking "where was this mom when I was growing up?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Wow. I never realized you considered me such a failure as a mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I don't consider you a failure. I just —  ...I never knew that there was an alternative.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> She's crashing again. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is it actually important that I understand what you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The baby's bleeding again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes, you're a genius.The bleeding means her liver is still failing. It's not a vascular malformation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House, come take a look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hold that thought. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> House, no! I need you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Just past the ileocecal valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's nothing. It's just an irregularity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's a dime!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a pocket of air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, with FDR's face on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not a face. It's a shadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, the thing is perfectly round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, move the wand to the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Tickles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> That's because I'm the tickle monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Gonna tickle you even more!  Look at–look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We need an X-ray to be sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great, just give her an unnecessary dose of radiation. It's a dime!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> House, I know you're in there! Open the door! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-31"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I saw your extension on the call. What are you doing down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He also has an outstanding bedside manner. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-34"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>...Her liver failure is getting worse. You were right. Now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The interesting question is not why she's worse now, but why she got better in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-36"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could have been something we did that temporarily relieved the—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What'd you put her on again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-38"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>After the transfusion, we gave her steroids, dopamine, and the anti —  steroids can treat idiopathic hepatic fibrosis. It would explain why she got better and then worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not the multiple dilated ducts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-40"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House, I need you back in here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cancer kid trumps liver kid.  Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-42"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That... is a dime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It looks mobile. And it's right in the middle of the colon. Prime location for pooping out. We'll give her some laxatives to help it on its way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-44"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Sounds to me like someone's going to get some yummy chocolate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're gonna make a great mommy one day.  Thanks for waiting. Hook the mom up to the baby. Direct blood transfusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-46"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>...And what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing else. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>It's a miracle. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A blood transfusion isn't a cure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a miracle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Then why does the baby seem like she's cured?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our patient can either go through life with the world's longest umbilical cord, or we can discuss the differential for magic blood. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either you're Dr. Cheng, or you're early for my mani-pedi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I thought her expertise could—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could tell us the O2-stats.  I hope you come with some original ideas. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Either the mom's blood is special, which would mean it's treating something specific, which means the baby has a disease... Or mom's blood is just blood, and it's replacing something the baby is missing, which means the baby has a simple deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors, enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm O Negative, universal donor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>I like them too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>That would be a fair assumption.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna have to test you. Let's say, two-year-old... swallowed a coin twenty hours ago. She's gonna be fine, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Any signs of obstruction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For the purposes of this quiz, let's say "not yet".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>I'd give a laxative, although I wouldn't wait too long. Her bowel could become ischemic, or worse, an intussusception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Define "too long."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Another six hours, max. By then, her system is clear. If it's not out, it's not coming out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And then what do I do?  I mean, what do you do? It's your test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content> I'd go in with a scope and get it.  Did I pass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Men's room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Turns out toilets are handy in this situation. And I felt relatively sure that Cuddy wouldn't come in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Seriously? This must be a terrible place to have s— </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is there such a place?  Okay, six more hours, then we're going in with a scope and pulling it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Scope a two-year-old? It's dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And as you keep pointing out, so is a dime ripping through her intestines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy will be home from work in six hours.  But no big deal. I'll just scream "look over there!" while you quickly shove a scope up her daughter's rectum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I could offer to baby-sit again, let her have the night out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sure. That won't raise any suspicions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wish I was nicer.  Hey. Give me your radiation dosimeter.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think we can say this isn't working. We'll get her back on your blood. That'll help for now, But this means there's an infection. First we need to identify it. We know it's in her liver, so we'll get a sample. Then we can figure out how to help her get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content> I had this baby because I... wanted a chance to be a "special mom". But... not this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Problems in radiology. A radiation dosimeter badge turned positive. I could have a CT Scanner that's leaking... a spilled vial of thallium somewhere... I don't even know whose badge it was. The code was scratched off.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't know. All I know is that I'm gonna need to work late. I was actually hoping that you could baby-sit.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's it?  How come no one got me food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>What do you mean, "that's it"? The woman has melanoma. She could die if we don't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boring. Since the baby has the melanoma, we kind of already knew the mom had it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Yes, but now we know where it is, so we can —  ...treat it much more effectively, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. So treat her. Also boring. What's interesting is that mom's melanoma spread to the baby in-utero, which means it's metastatic, which means it's late stage. How many people with a late stage melanoma are as healthy as she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Clearly, something's going on in mom's blood that's treating her melanoma as well as her baby's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Antibodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If her immune system was fighting the melanoma, it never would have spread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly, which means it's fighting something else, and the melanoma cells are getting caught in the crossfire. So what's mom's immune system really shooting at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Scleroderma can cause cancer-fighting antibodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So can Churg Strauss... pretty much any auto-immune disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Or infections that cause granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, Dr. Cheng? This is not boring.  Start with auto-immune. Go test her blood.  And leave your food. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I ate all the right foods, I read all the books and the studies, and  I... even hired a private detective to research each sperm donor.  I just missed one big thing. My own cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm all done here. We'll have the results soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>And if that's what this is? An auto-immune disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Treatment's... fairly simple.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I'm sorry, mom. Not just for this, but for what I said earlier.  I was jealous and angry, and... I lashed out. But you were a great mom. You are a great mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So, what did House want earlier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chang</speaker><content>He just gave me a little quiz and said he was okay with hiring me, but that it was your decision. Negative for dermatomyositis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's just saying that to set me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Chang</speaker><content>So you're — you're not offering me the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If he wants me to offer you the job, something's going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Chang</speaker><content>That... was my thinking too. It's not Lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Things with House are never as simple as they seem. Trust me, he's got an ulterior motive, and I've got to figure it out before I do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Chang</speaker><content>...Okay.  Mom's negative for Churg Strauss. This isn't auto-immune. Time to scan her for infections that could cause granulomas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Third poop in the last half-hour. Still nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Either it's a trap or it's not. Just hire her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lungs clear for granulomas... Yeah, who cares? Did you enjoy that bear trap snapping on your leg yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You do realize it's just a metaphorical trap? You'll still have all your limbs.  Fourth rib about the midclavicular line. You're over-thinking this. House fired my pick sight-unseen. He was never even interested in Chase's pick, he was only obsessed with how she reflected on Chase. Dr. Cheng is the only candidate he's actually responded to. You wanted House invested. He is. Hire her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you think I'm over-thinking this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Shut up and hire her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> ...Look. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oat cell lung cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I thought I had skin cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>As unlikely as it sounds, you have both. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, the lung cancer is basically treating the skin cancer. It's why you're not feeling sick. And why your blood's helping your baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We found it early, so it should be treatable. In a way, your daughter saved your life. We'll get you set up for the surgery and start you on chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>What about Kayla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She'll only need the chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Abbie</speaker><content> Can't you just keep giving her my blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not once we cut out the tumor. Your body will stop making the antibodies that are keeping your baby healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>Can you hold off on my surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Over the last day, your baby's liver tumors have shrunk 15%. Projecting forward, it would take eight or nine days to completely eradicate her cancer cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>So let's take the eight or nine days—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The cancer probably won't spread in the next nine days, but there are other risks. Cancer thickens your blood, which could cause clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>What are the risks to putting my baby on chemo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It could damage her brain or affect her development, but these risks are small compared to the risks that you would be taking by leaving your cancers untreated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I want to wait.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>I'll take the risks. I want what's best for my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I'm your daughter too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content>She's a baby. You're an adult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>So what? I don't need my mom anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content> No. You never did. 'Cause I wasn't there for you. But look at you. You turned out great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content> Oh, you don't know if I'm great. You don't know me at all. And I'm not gonna let you martyr yourself for a two-day-old infant just because you feel guilty because you weren't around for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>Abbey</speaker><content> I'm not martyring myself. It's nine days.  Let's hold off on the surgery. </content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You brought food? This is a medical procedure, not a dinner date!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm aware that this is a delicate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo —  where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was she there when you picked up the food?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You ordered extra pancakes?? How much did they cost?  Where—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> 55 cents. And there were two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So that means the total on the last bill was—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> $18.42.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> $18.42.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>...Yeah.  So the image that we saw on the ultrasound—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along. But you saw the worst case scenario...  ...like every irrational, worried parent.  You'd make a terrible mommy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>... give me some dumplings? </content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>Mom, I brought you some —  Mom? Mom!  We need help in here! Somebody help us! </content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>...she died in seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Wouldn't have happened if she let us remove the tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Probably not. Postmortem, we were able to harvest all of her blood. It's enough to treat the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>That's something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pretty amazing case. Thanks for your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>I was glad for the chance to work it with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I've thought about it, and...  ...I'd like to formally offer you the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>It's funny, I–I wanted to work on House's team... until I started working with his team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Yeah, I know. Chase and Foreman can get a little—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>Actually, it's you.  I get that House is an ass, but at least he owns it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You don't understand. This whole thing was just a game to House. I didn't have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Cheng</speaker><content>You're a grown man, Dr. Taub. You can make whatever choices you want, and instead of hiring me when he said you could, you chose to act like a paranoid, scared little kid.  I hate kids.  Good-bye, Dr. Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Justine</speaker><content>I'll make sure you never forget her... and what she did for you. She was just trying to be the best mom in the world. She was. </content></utterance>
