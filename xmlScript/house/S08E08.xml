<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>And you're sure he didn't leave until after 9:00?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Absolutely. We watched the Devils demolish the Rangers. The game started at 7:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, pick up a pizza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>We stayed at my place. We were together the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>And you said the Devils won?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yup. 4-zip. Kovalchuk had two, Arnott and Parise each had one, and Marty got the shutout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Marty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Martin Brodeur. Devils' starting goalie for, like, the past 20 years. He played awesome as usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Your Honor, may I submit the sports page from the New Jersey Chronicle on October 9th, 2011.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Objection. Relevance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Goes to the witness's credibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>Go quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Would you please read the caption under the photo? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> "Martin Brodeur stops 1 of his 36 saves on the way to a shutout victory." That's what I just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Thank you. Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle sports page from October 10th?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Your Honor…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>This is what you call going quickly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Just two more questions. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Please read  the highlighted text at the bottom of the page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>"In Sunday's sports section, New Jersey Devils goaltender Johan Hedberg was…"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>That's it. Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>"Misidentified as Martin Brodeur in a photo caption and box score."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content> An understandable mistake. Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up. Which brings me to my most relevant question. Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th watching the Devils game on TV, or did you just read about the game in the Chronicle while concocting this false alibi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Um… I… I, um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Excuse me, Your Honor, may I approach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>You sure you don't want to wait till after he answers your question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>No. I'm gonna need a continuance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content> Now? You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>Oh, shut up. You know it's true. Let's finish this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>Why the hell not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Because I think I'm having a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Judge Foley</speaker><content>Great. Call an ambulance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't. His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization are all normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause it's an anxiety attack. Probably because he just turned 40 and still goes by the name "Tommy". </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not anxiety. The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife. She confirmed he's been feeling fine. Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably also believes that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam. No improvements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Pain would be restricted to one dermatome. It wouldn't cross them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No history of asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> They did a lateral view as well. No sign of a pneumothorax or deep sulcus sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Chlorine gas pools near the ground he thought he'd be safe in the top bunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He makes a living sending people to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Arceus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look it up. And alkalinize his urine. Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it. And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Must be such a pleasure to live in your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. Kids might be precocious.  You handle his house.  You handle him and his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They  get to just hang out and do nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you need help, you can take whoever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chase and Adams</speaker><content>I'll take Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No, it's not. It was a 50/50 choice. I'm totally fine with Taub or Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Cool. I'll take Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And I'll take Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nice move, boss. Lying to the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I had no choice. I knew House wouldn't take the case unless I ruled out anxiety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You need a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To keep me from lying to patients?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it. You're not working for House anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not looking for excitement. I'm doing my job, part of which is to make sure House does his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Girlfriend might not be so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's less dangerous than where you're headed. And that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's this new curve control thing. It automatically slows the car when it senses I'm taking a curve too fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You really think I care about your car? Or are you just trying to avoid talking about why you don't like working with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>There's nothing to talk about. House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid, and now he wants to do the same with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass. He obviously noticed something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Yeah, the fact that we work well together. He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment. Don't let it be us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why would they thank him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>Because he doesn't treat them like scum. He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience. And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it. He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wait. You mean literally? Like, not even a bottle of water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So he was obviously afraid of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>Yeah, rats, mice, cockroaches.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>My first job out of law school was at the health department. If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have, you'd cook all your own food too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Poison wouldn't have to be in food. Have you gotten any strange letters or packages recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You also wouldn't have to be at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>We've got two young kids. There's definitely no poisons I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if it wasn't an accident? How are things between you and your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content> Are you asking me if I think my wife is trying to kill me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Absolutely not. This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open. I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives, parents. I can assure you…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No pesticides, fertilizers, or fuel in the garage. You find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Maybe we should look again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Maybe we should leave before the police get here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed, it's low priority. We've got another five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He's a prosecutor. Obviously he knows a lot of cops. His house is not gonna be low priority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Good point. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Wait. The dining room's on the other side of that wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>But it ends, like, three feet further over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You've got to be kidding me. A second ago, you wanted to run like hell, and now you want to look for secret passages?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>There's a magnet on the fridge they use to open child-proofed cabinets. Go get it. Hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Holy crap. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Don't tell me. The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We didn't find any poisons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you obviously found something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Or break into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>That's impossible. You must have broken into the wrong house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>I-I don't understand. How could this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I had it put in during the remodel last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>But we went over the plans together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>It's not in the plans. I didn't want the city to know about it. I'm sorry. I should have told you. I just… I didn't want you and the kids to worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>About what? Tommy, what is it? Why would you think you needed so many guns?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You're not gonna believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Imperio absenti chaos regit. He's worried that "too big to fail" applies to our banks but not our government.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.  Heather Sweeney.  Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe it's not stupidity. It's a symptom. Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>This isn't necessarily paranoia. Societies do fall apart. Look what happened with London and the riots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>April Donaldson.  Sorry. Misspoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>That's ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Oh, shut up. We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> It was a little harsh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Stop being so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>What? Paranoid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> I think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons, he's obviously paranoid. What about Fahr's disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He's not hallucinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>As far as we know. We should do a mental status examination and get a CT of his basal ganglia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>No, we shouldn't. If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>No, we don't. We have a reasoned disagreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Still there's only one way to settle this. Actually there's two, but we don't have enough Jell-O for the first. Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use. Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study.  Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He's not "stuck" with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And it's not a fight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Lady</speaker><content>Mariel Wilkerson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huh. You don't look like a Mariel. You're up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>So what do you think — is the patient paranoid or am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday, I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>And me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Again, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's… Don't let House get to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's all of you. I feel like you don't respect me. Chase certainly doesn't try to hide it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Chase respects you. He's just more comfortable working with me because he's known me longer. And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I don't own a gun. I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch. What about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If anarchy breaks out, I plan to do what my ancestors have done throughout the ages — run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Forman</speaker><content>Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What makes you—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So a few people are nice to you, and your first thought is, "Hmm, this seems strange." I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch, much less run around trying to recruit nurses for you. So, can I get back to work? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You're lying, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's for his own good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's not paranoid. He's just stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group? You own a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our patient doesn't own a gun. He owns an arsenal. And I don't own a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, you do. And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun. Why would I need a gun? The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't own anything you need. You own things you want. And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun. You like anything dangerous — monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everyone loves fireworks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Watching them, not making them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I stand corrected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not resolved, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not even close.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It's not cocaine. Hair samples were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's not looking good for Fahr's either. I'm not seeing any calcifications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You sure? They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We all disagree all the time. It's not just me and Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nice try, but I'm not getting in the middle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>So why didn't you want to go with her this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>She's not weird. She's a good doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Most good doctors are weird. Look at House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Am I weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.  You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You're weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In a good way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You own any guns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>That's not medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But it's related to medicine. Kind of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, but not for protection. Despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world. You just think they're fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not here in the States. Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You hunt kangaroos? But they're so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They're also delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You're screwing with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Totally. There's no calcification. Looks like we're both wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>It's okay. I'll stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Go. I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh? Give the kids a kiss for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Oh, honey, come on. I don't think the world's coming to an end. Look…  You have a spare tire in your car, right? That's what those guns are. I mean, I hope to God I never have to use one. But if we can wake up and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight, it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk. Just in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>And you've always—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>What's that from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I don't know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You don't feel that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He also spiked a fever overnight. It could be TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want to say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Say what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. It's med-speak for she's an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It would have to be pretty far along. His first symptom was just a few days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>His paranoia started at least a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>If he's paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Now's your chance. She's leading with her chin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I agree with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you don't. Which means you're both idiots. Get to work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I know you don't think I'm an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no. But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me useful, then yes. I thought we'd gotten past that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here. But ability isn't always enough. Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>So this is you trying to help me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, this is me helping me. And amusing myself at your expense. Which brings us back to, why do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I deserve respect. I'm a good doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People respect you.  They just don't like you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>She just needed some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not a fan of guns I take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>It's not the guns. It's… I shouldn't have lied about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm guessing it's a little of both. And a little of, "Who the hell is this guy?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I'm not a nutcase. I just want to do everything I can to protect my family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With some difficulty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Then what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A sign that you need to take a long vacation. At least a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>A vacation? Wait, is this like a bucket list thing? It's cancer…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's silver. I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, damn.  It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin. That normally happens every 30 days.  So, I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got the world's largest beer can. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>All right, I admit it. Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd never find it because you are more devious—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Devious.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Anita</speaker><content>Who's Taub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know, I'm sure you're a nice person and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, I'm not interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Anita</speaker><content>Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person, but I just moved from Atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym, so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is, but I already agree. He's a jerk.  Are you sure you don't want to start over? Take your time. I'll be around. </content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Points again to paranoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I agree. Except for the "again". Acute onset points to tularemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Or it's been chronic, which points to GAD autoimmunity. Explains the neurological impairment as well as the normal blood work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You know what else doesn't show up in the blood work? Nothing. This could be all psychiatric. An untreated schizoid disorder he's finally lost the ability to suppress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, but digging delusions out of your skin with dirty fingernails could cause both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I don't think he's a psych case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you're paranoid about paranoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Because his symptoms point towards an infection that spread to his brain. I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treat for GAD. Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I'm not paranoid. And they don't dislike me. They don't even really know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They tell you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It makes you feel better to think that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You're the one everyone dislikes. You probably don't even think it's GAD. You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's only one way to find out. Actually, there's two but we're still waiting for that Jell-O delivery. Let me know how it goes. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Anita</speaker><content>It's just you have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Anita</speaker><content>Please. I'll explain later. Just hurry up. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Anita</speaker><content>No, he's not my boyfriend. He's my husband. I'm really sorry. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Or it's GAD, and we started treatment too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Increase the steroid dose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We can't. If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way. If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late. He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago. He can fight this off if we give him a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. But a shotgun is not gonna work. We need a sniper rifle. Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to just—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I changed my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>But—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do what Park says. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket — I can't imagine why…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Had to kill a mouse. It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And my money clip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was there any money in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can I go to bed now? Or do you want to do a cavity search? Lock up on your way out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>For the wrong diagnosis. If it was GAD, he'd be having seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>If it was infection, there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS. Which there isn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This was House's idea. He said—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, I'm talking about the Jell-O. At least it wouldn't be so annoying to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What's the problem? Some cute young nurse baked you cookies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, some guy almost caught me making out with his wife in their living room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And how exactly is that my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head. You really do need psychiatric help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Unlike you, I don't need drama. I like my job, and I'm happy with my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight than to come back into work to yell at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stay out of my business. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're blaming the wrong guy!  Good for him. Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>He has stridor but no obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's anaphylaxing. Get me a trach kit. Scalpel.  It's not working. There's no breath sounds. It doesn't make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His trachea's blocked below the incision point. We need racemic epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>We tried that already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're gonna try again. It's our only choice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We got him breathing, but barely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did because we're not doing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which is a good thing, because neither GAD nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So we've got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless he was still being poisoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>By who? His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Now we're the ones being paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>What about squamous cell carcinoma? If it's only in his epithelium, it wouldn't show up in his chest X-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It is possible, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn't cause hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think it's cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you should get a biopsy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Admit it.  Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it. I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking. So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment for .45-caliber bullets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And that's not a bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Admit it. I'm more clever and more devious. You can even have it back. It's not my problem if you go back to prison. My problem is you thinking you're always one step ahead of me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't be insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're blanks. You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth. Go ahead. Shoot me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not shooting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All right. I'll shoot you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-35"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Don't. House, don't. Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not real.  Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun. Which means you proved nothing. Admit it. Admit it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me a Machida scope.   Hold his legs. He's not gonna like this. Because you're not gonna be able to breathe. But I need to see down your barrel.  Good news is the poison didn't come from your wife. It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.   Call the CDC. Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>I know, okay. It was for our own good, but I don't care. I don't want to be lied to, and I can't live like that. I can't live in that home.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Olivia</speaker><content>I love you too. Which is why you're not gonna live there either. I don't care if we might need them. I just know that I can't live my life feeling like we do. It's not worth living in fear.</content></utterance>
