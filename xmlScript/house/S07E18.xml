<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You figured out I was in jail but you don’t know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I’ve been busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Excessive prescribing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Not that busy. I know that you pled down to excessive prescribing. The question was “what did you DO?”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>36-year-old non-smoking junior high science teacher started coughing blood in the middle of homeroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Sweet! If I go straight to the airport, I can make Cabo for the last call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He also said to call him if we find a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Which we didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What do you call this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He’s coughing blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>A lot of people are. Right now I have to get to Vernon while there is still enough powder to ski on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Make it fast. I'm driving. I don't want to end up in jail like…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>… A person should who used their phone illegally while driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>36-year-old male with hemoptysis, headaches, chills, and chest pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>On my way to the greater Schenectady chili cook-off and spud gun competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>That's your honeymoon? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nope, Dominika went to A.C. with her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>E.R. ruled out bronchitis, pneumonia, and lung cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So diagnosis… boring. It's epistaxis. It's a nosebleed. Blood runs into his lungs, he coughs it back up, flu explains the rest of the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Going once, going twice…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Toxic exposure to ammonia or sulfites can traumatize the lungs, cause neuralgias or fevers. Fits better because of his radiating chest pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sold. To Masters.  Do a home search for toxins. Draw cultures for bacteria and fungi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You're married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You were gone so long.  Green card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Thanks for not saying anything. I just need some time to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I didn't do it for you. Some puzzles are just too good to share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>This is my exit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Chili?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. You think that's where the blood came from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I don't just think it. I hope it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>When was the last time it happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>At the quarterfinals. I coach volleyball, and during warm-ups, I got hit in the nose a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>With showers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Clean showers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>Not particularly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The blood you were coughing up wasn't blood. Dirty gym washroom means serratia infection. Your lungs are full of red bacteria.  You were right. That was an interesting case. You start him on Levaquin.  I'll start looking for my good flip-flops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Think that might be blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>What's this really all about, House? As convincing as I find your deep devotion to vegetable trajectory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>First of all, it's a tuber. And you're just jealous because your potato-related plans are more of the serving up fries variety.  You did time. Means your license is suspended. Which means your leave of absence is definitely indefinite. What exactly are you going back to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I'd only have to serve up fries until the medical board hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I stand corrected. You obviously have a rich, full life waiting for you. I'll slow down the car and you can roll out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Damn. If only I'd planned for that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay. Here’s what I’ve got. One: you were in jail for 6 months but you were gone about a year, which means that when you left, you hadn’t been arrested. Two: you enjoy being known as a number, you don’t want people to know the real you since the real you is weak. You were running a bleeding heart medical consulting business for illegals or some other sympathetic under-class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Over-class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>The interrogation thing is getting annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Studies have shown that un-annoying interrogation is 50 percent less effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wilson thinks it’s stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I think it’s stupid! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Junior year high school, you placed fourth in the West Virginia all-county science fair. Your project? Clean combustion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Yeah. I also wore a training bra. Things have changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I've been going to this contest for four years. For four years I've come second to a pissant named Harold Lam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>This is serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Second!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Okay. I can help you, but I'm going to need to make a personal stop along the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What kind of stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Personal. Did I not mention that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You gonna tell me where you were last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I ran into a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We had 50 bucks on the Bulls. I had to eat a large pizza by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You missed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Not as much as I miss my $50.  Where'd you meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>At the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>If it's Masters, just lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The redhead. She's hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>And I'm seeing her again tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I don't know how you do it. Is it the cute, harmless vibe, the self-deprecating humor, or just straight-up roofies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>If you're interested, I do seminars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No electric, no gas either. It's cold in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The good thing is I found a guy who makes you look like a good roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Maybe hoarding's a symptom. Could be caused by brain injury or early-onset Alzheimer's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>It's most likely that it's psychological. As to what's making him cough blood, dealer's choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>How does this guy live, let alone make it to work every day and teach a bunch of kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I'll be in the car. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Okay, turn right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You were writing bogus prescriptions for medical marijuana.  Please say no because you have to be an idiot to actually screw that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>No. I mean, I was, but I didn't get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I have to admit, you have one of the best game faces I've ever seen. Also one of the best game bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Pull over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Didn't know you were a Jehovah's Witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You're really not gonna tell me what just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I don't know about you, but I am starving.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We slowly pushed into your home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>So what did you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>A compost heap in your fridge. We think you have aspergillosis. It's treatable with antifungals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You do remarkably well for living… like you live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>I use bottled water and flashlights. It's like camping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Fun. We're also gonna need a psych consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>I'm not a hoarder. I'm just a major slob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You save earwax.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You know, I'm actually kind of hurt that you don't know what I did. I'm not worth bribing a court official or hacking into police records?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Where's the fun in that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You don't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>What, is he dead or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You're gonna have to do a lot better than that.  Are… are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, I'm fine. It's not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I killed a man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Psych eval gave us nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>So our patient is just an average Joe with a two-foot pile of used q-tips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Whatever he is, he doesn't have aspergillosis. Pain's intensified, and now he needs oxygen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>There's got to be all kinds of toxins in that place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Exposure issues don't make sense. He's been here a full day. He'd be getting better, not worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Unless exposure was keeping him from getting worse. The gas was off at his place. How does he stay warm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Portable heater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Or portable gas heater, which emits carbon monoxide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Which is a vasodilator. The low-grade exposure was actually improving his lung capacity. We bring him here, he gets worse. If we're right, don't need House, and we still get two days off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We still have to prove it. Someone's got to go back into that place and test for C.O. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Chase and I can go.  It's only fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Fairness is important.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You're awfully quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sorry. That's just how I get around people who have recently killed a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>It wasn't… You know, I've had a pretty rough year. Do you think maybe we could just give this whole thing a rest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You killed a man! But you pled out to drugs. Hit-and-run under the influence. Guy you kneed in the groin was your date who dropped a dime on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I'm asking you to let it go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Ruby, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Ruby </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Ruby </speaker><content>It's great. Everyone's so friendly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Yeah. Especially Dr. Taub. Don't worry. I'm not gonna bust your chops. I just want to know one thing. How did he get you to go out with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>No, no, no, no, he's… he's great. I'm… you know, I'm just asking because…  Well, he's… um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You know what, never mind. It's none of my business. You guys have fun tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Ruby </speaker><content>I'm not seeing him tonight. We had plans, but he canceled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Woman on PA </speaker><content>Dr. Stern to Radiology. Dr. Stern to Radiology.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>This thing's got no fuel valve. Means you can't regulate the input.  And what is this? A barbecue lighter?  Your gun sucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You like it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You don't think this is fascinating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Not nearly as fascinating as the fact that you think it's fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>But this guy kept everything he ever came into contact with. An interactive life history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's an indiscriminate pile of rubbish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, for the most part, so are our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Maybe we don't just figure out the what, we figure out the why. Then maybe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>If you're thinking Q fever, it fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So why are you still looking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, you only found one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It fits perfectly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Yeah, but that doesn't mean…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You missed something at his place. His wife.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We think you both have Q fever. Found raccoon feces in the kitchen cupboard. We're gonna start you on Doxycycline. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Why wouldn't you tell us you're married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>The fewer people who know about her, the easier it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Nina </speaker><content>When can I go back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>She gets anxious when she's away from her things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>She's the hoarder. He just lives there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>On purpose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>She's my wife.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>By the way, Harold's probably gonna hit on you. Everything I have, he wants. Just turn him down flat. Unless…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm not sugges…  Would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hang time, distance, and accuracy. Okay, how about this? You met a guy in a club, you brought him home, he O.D.'d, so the guy now writhing on his front porch was the dealer who sold you the faulty goods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Categories weighted the same?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Screw accuracy. We're gonna double distance and hang time, beat Harold on points. We need raw power. Where's the fertilizer? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Better than sex with a 22-year-old?  Who's RT92?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Presumably a 21-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Whoever it is, Taub's meeting 'em at my place at 8:00, which is usually when I go to the gym.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Schedule 80 PVC is pressure rated for 220 psi, fuel valve 300. We can easily push it to 250, have your friend Harold peeing in his pants.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>We're celebrating. We're going rogue. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>We rip out the combustion valve, replace it with disks. With enough pressure, it should blow out at maximum velocity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Turning the spud into spudnik. What do we use for disks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Well, here's a hint. I actually hate rhubarb.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>No more guessing?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>When we first moved into the house, we had people over all the time. Then she started collecting things. I figured it was a hobby. Piles turned into art projects, and art projects turned into what you saw.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>To everyone else, the world is full of junk… meaningless, ugly, broken things. But to Nina, every shape, every color, texture, smell, they all tell a story. They're all worth treasuring. I wouldn't wish what she has on anyone, but every now and then I get a glimpse of what she sees, and… It helps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Your lungs are clearing up nicely. Respiratory rate's normal. Temp's normal. Looks like you're gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Something's wrong with her heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>The husband is fine. The wife is worse. She had a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Her heart attack could be from a complication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Q fever would cause congestive heart failure, not myocardial infarction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So she had Q fever and something else that causes heart attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And the hoarding. Now that the wife is the only patient, hoard is back on the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Or we were wrong about Q fever. I don't buy it's just a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's not a coincidence. Diagnosis X caused the hoarding, which caused the Q fever when the raccoons came to spend spring break at her house. Now all we have to do is solve for X.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I remember somebody saying that hoarding could be a symptom. We should do an MRI. Hydrogen sulfide. It's given off by eggs and rotting food. Long-term exposure could cause the pulmonary issues, headaches…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Even the heart attack. Hydrogen sulfide is also a vasodilator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Which my crack team never tested the place for. Of course, half my crack team never tested the place for people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So we should go back, check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Might be safer to just assume we're right and start treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Go with God. And some air freshener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You know, maybe Taub is right, so I'm gonna stay here with him and help him with the MRI.`</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Man on PA </speaker><content>Shine up your spuds, folks. We're gonna start shooting for hang time in just a few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The wind's coming from the southeast. You have to aim five degrees to the left. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>We're gonna break 14 seconds. I can feel it.  When I was 10 or 11, my dad used to take us to this county fair. And there was this kid…  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Who's "us"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>My mom and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Not everything means something. We're gonna be up soon. I want to check the pressure. She picks up the gun and walks away.]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger. You don't confess to killing a man and then hide the details unless the details reveal more about you than the crime itself.  You pled down to drugs. You've got a horrible genetic disease and a sibling who's suddenly on your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You euthanized your brother. And that guy back at the house was the doctor who wouldn't help you cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But I was right about everything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Congratulations. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You're mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>No. Actually, I'm impressed. Messing around on a 22-year-old hottie with your wife on my sofa. You're a full-throttle head case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I was doing you a solid with the sofa. Rachel wanted to do it in your bed. You've got the memory foam top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Let's make this really simple: If I own it, I don't want you doing it on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You might want to get rid of your kitchen table. Look, I'm sorry,  but it was worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Yeah, I bet. You get to mess with her physically and emotionally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I still care about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Not enough to let her move on with her life. While we're talking about your bad ideas, MRI's clean.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>There has to be some kind of inciting psychological incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>This is perfect for you. You get all the human interaction you crave without any actual human interaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You know when you're interested in something and nobody else is, the polite thing is to keep it to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Popular, beautiful, gregarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hydrogen sulfide's about two parts per billion. The size of a healthy fart. I'll be back for you in July.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Harold </speaker><content>Dumped in a field in Schenectady. Ouch. You mind if I make a move? I know she's out of my league, but she's at a spud gun contest with the soon-to-be five-time runner-up, so she's probably got some self-esteem issues.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, it turns out our friend Harold felt up the sheriff's daughter last night at the potato mash mixer, so sheriff's feeling kind of ambivalent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>You always get your way, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Not always.  Today would have been our one-year anniversary.  Which is an incredibly arbitrary thing to celebrate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>If you want to get to the bottom of something, you literally have to dig down to the bottom. So stratigraphically, the oldest stuff I found was in the bedroom. And the oldest stuff in the bedroom was in the closet. And at the bottom of the closet… Tell me about this. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We have a new symptom. Infertility. They wanted kids but couldn't have them. She started collecting things to fill the void. We should run a full hormone blood panel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hey, Harriet the Spy, before you get too full of yourself, you might want to go back to bio 101. It takes two to not-tango.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Hubby could be shooting blanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So either it's a new symptom that will help us save her life or it's a complete waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Figure out which is fried, the bacon or the eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I'll start the hormone workup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>There's another option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Radio. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Sounded a lot like… Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's a Thirteen tribute band with their new song, "I've got a better theory than Masters."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>She said they never had kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Oh, my God. Where the hell have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>No, we don't. She's been missing for a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You can ask her all about it when she comes in on Monday. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Can I talk? She said they never had kids, and you all jumped to infertility. You never considered the other option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And the bitch is back. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We think you have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It would explain the symptoms. It also causes miscarriages. Is that something you think you might have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>Were you pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Nina </speaker><content>Three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The miscarriages triggered the hoarding. Hoarding eventually made you sick too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We can treat the physical symptoms as they arise, make her life a lot better, but the hoarding, we're the wrong kind of doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Brian </speaker><content>What have I ever done to make you afraid of that?  I need to get some air.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I've been selfish. I need to let you move on. I think we should stop seeing each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Um, I just want you to be able to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>The last time you got all noble on me, we ended up dividing our dishes. This time, I want to make the decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You don't feel weird about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Of course I feel weird about this. It's confusing and messy and dirty. Dumb. But we spent our whole lives trying to do everything right, and it sucked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It wasn't all bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>It sucked, Chris. And this,  whatever it is, it's fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>So I'm not taking advantage of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>The fun is fading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You know… there's something seriously wrong with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You owe me 87 bucks for gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'll kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>When the time comes, if you want me to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'll do it now if you like.  I think I've got a baseball bat in the back.</content></utterance>
