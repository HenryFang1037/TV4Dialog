<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>So there I am on my 25th birthday, driving from Wheeling, West Virginia to Bensonhurst in a Dodge Dart with no radio, and a gun-runner named Barrel-Head; who insisted we sing every Jimmy Buffet song he could recall. What could I say? The man was heavily armed.  So five hundred renditions of "Margaritaville" later, my first cover; eight thousand words on how Barrel-Head and his friends were transporting handguns for sale to New York City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Fletch?! Fletch? Fletcher?  Fletch? Fletcher? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>Fletcher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Honey? Sweetie? Are you ok?  Are you ok? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content> I flung the investment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>What did you say? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content> Umm... flung the investment... why can sign.  Why can sign? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>I'll call 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>It's proficient!  Why disqualify the rush? I'm tabled. I'm tabled!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Need your advice, what's the best diagnostics department within 60 miles of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>‘We’ aren't here. House is in Baltimore lying to Medicaid about his billings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So? I'm board certified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You are not House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why'd you put me in charge of the department if you think I can't handle it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because it's temporary, and because I was ordered to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are the symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh come on! You're going to diagnose him without meeting him? Prove that you're as brilliant as House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I need to know the symptoms to know which hospital to recommend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>EMT's report - patient struck his head and is suffering from aphasia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hmm! Neurological problem. Now I know a lot of good people in that field, seeing as I happen to BE a neurologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're pouting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not at all! Taylor's pretty good. House was ready to hire him until he got my resume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's Fletcher Stone. Wrote 12 books? Exposed three administrations? Before he exposes us--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I get it. Famous patient needs famous doctor. I’ll call Taylor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or... maybe you should call him? What if I say something stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh god.  House is easier! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you been taking any drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>I displaced my function... back laid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>He used to drink regularly, but he's been clean and sober for nearly a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mr. Stone, you think you're speaking normally, but your speech is impaired.  He knows what he wants to say, but when he reaches for a word, he finds something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>I grapple average.  Cancer glisten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>He doesn't know that he's saying it wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It all sounds right to him.  I want you to write your name, and draw a face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's called agraphia, loss of ability to write. Most often it's temporary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How hard did he hit his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>It was a pretty good crack. It made a really ugly sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Do you understand what I’m saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Of golf!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don’t give me a sentence. Just a yes or a no. You understand me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content> ... Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content> Elizabeth! Fletch! Is he ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>We don't know.  This is... uhh... Fletcher's editor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>Greta Simms. I wanted to make sure the EMT's told you the right story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How many stories are there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>He didn't trip. He just fell, out of the blue. His foot jerked a little bit first, that's what made it look like a trip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Don't say anything; don't attempt to defend your billing practices, your billing practices are indefensible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We've been over this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>If I thought you were capable of listening, I'd shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That makes no sense at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Medicaid Guy</speaker><content>Good afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Good afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Medicaid Guy</speaker><content>Every case you have rates a 5 on the complexity scale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Doctor House has a rather specialized practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Medicaid Guy</speaker><content>Ah. Okay. Then let's go through these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All of these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Medicaid Guy</speaker><content>If you have lunch reservations, cancel them. All right... patient...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If he didn't trip, something made him fall. Stroke? Seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Thirty people saw him trip, one person says he didn't. Who are we going to believe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His symptoms can all be explained by the head trauma; causes a contusion or a seizure that causes the aphasia. We should get an EEG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it was a stroke, could be a clotting issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Even if he fell, drug use is far more likely. I’m ordering a tox screen </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase, we're not done with the differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You're not my boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm House's boss, House is your boss. The math is pretty simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are you signing my paychecks? Are you hiring or firing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is not about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The only thing you've been asked to do is supervise House in case he does something insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which might, you know, save a life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Somebody's gotta be in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What? You think we should all do whatever we want to do? Maybe have a race to the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think it should be a discussion among peers! I think we’re grown up enough to reach a consensus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>Patient, 62-yrs-old. You prescribed Viagra. I look in vain for the words 'erectile dysfunction' in the notes for Delores Smith?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She had a heart condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>And you ran out of nitroglycerin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they’re vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I think Doctor House understands--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well of course I do. The woman has a heart condition and she’s on her own. A man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, I'll pay for it.  How much are the pills? She took how many?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Put the money away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>Are you trying to bribe me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>My client's an idiot.  But is he wrong about the pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>Off-label use is not sanctioned--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're retiring in three weeks. You've been doing this job nearly twenty years, aren't you tired of administering policy you disagree with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Medicaid guy</speaker><content>I never said I disagreed with--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What can they do to you? And Doctor House is sorry  about his earlier outburst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do background checks on Medicaid personnel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I do what's necessary for my client.  Wow! New personal record!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, time's good for me too; got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You booked us dinner reservations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Don't you have a plane to catch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Your flight leaves at 7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You did a background check on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And mine doesn't leave until 9pm. It looks like you’ll be dining alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I didn't think we'd be finished this soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where's your crucifix?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I left it at the jeweler’s to be cleaned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Riiight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> This will show us if there's a problem with your carotid artery that might cause a blood clot. If it went to his brain, it could explain the aphasia and the falling down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content> And you're giving him an EEG, is that for the same thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uh, it's just a precaution. We think the trauma caused some swelling and we need to keep him stable until the body can repair the damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content> And you think they're both wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're just covering all the bases, being safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His 02 stats going down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Fluid in his lungs</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Push 40 IV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to intubate, he's losing his respiratory drive.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And then there were two. Aphasia and fluid in the lungs. Seizure can't cause both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Neither can a stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Unless he had an abnormal heart rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And then there was one.  Urine test was positive for amphetamines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Amphetamines don't cause pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They do if you smoke them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In one of his books, he talked about giving up drugs and alcohol, how it changed his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Everybody lies. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>When he started wanting to hear every minute of my day, it should have been a clue he was the jealous type. But you know, in that first stage of a relationship  where it's like your body's full of these chemicals that make you think everything they do is... charming. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uhhh...  Excuse me.  Hello.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey honey, how are the kids? They miss me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> This may take a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's new with Mr. Aphasia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy called you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everybody covers their ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen, came back positive for amphetamines, he did the dance of victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm betting there's another shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I thought the kids didn't call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know the way you tell stories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test, found him running a temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ok, I gotta hang up. They're probably trying to reach me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't have call waiting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm hanging up on you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's five dollars a month.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Drugs don't cause fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Encephalitis or meningitis are the obvious suspects. Start him on antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be an auto-immune disease. Lupus, Behçet's... we could start him on a high dose of steroids. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Except if he does have encephalitis, steroids could weaken his immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How high a fever?  Put me on speakerphone. And why haven't you called me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> 101. How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, you think you guys could have a party as soon as the parents are gone and I won't hear about it?  Start with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis, and an anti-viral in case we luck out and its herpes encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What if it's auto-immune?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well then we're screwed. Which is why we need more information.  Any genetic issue with the family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The man can't talk, his medical records are sketchy, and wife's only known him a couple of years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>MRI show anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>CT scan was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>CT... that's like, short for MRI, right? Excellent, well I guess that saves us a lot of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes. Earliest Foreman could get the machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I teach you to lie, and cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line?  Get an MRI, and get a better medical history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The man can't talk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares? He's probably going to lie anyway. My flight’s a little late; we'll be back in a few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So... you're in charge of us because you're in charge of him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Any family history of neurological problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you been out of the country in the last 5 years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>3 years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>He stopped traveling for work 2 years ago, after we got serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Any vacations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>His last one was 6 months ago; it was a golf resort at Key Biscayne...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>No way it was a golf resort. Knowing Fletch, I assume he was working his way through every bar in the Keys. Last hoorah before settling down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Alcohol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Amphetamines?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You tested positive. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>He doesn't use drugs, I told you. When we got engaged, we decided we wanted a different kind of life. And he dropped the macho-journalism, no more taking crazy chances. That includes his health.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>He asked me not to tell Elizabeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's been lying to her about his drug habit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>Well... yes and no. B.E., before Elizabeth, he used drugs recreationally. I wasn't crazy about it, but that thrill-seeking behavior is what made him the kind of journalist that he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And... now? A.E.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>Man's twisted himself into knots for her. Completely cleaned up his act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But the drugs...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>They're medicinal. Sort of. He was having trouble sleeping. This new suburban lifestyle, lack of excitement was throwing him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So he started with sleeping pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Greta</speaker><content>When they knocked him out, he needed something to perk him back up during the day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Every day?  No slippery slope there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Keep the stain, knife can't force. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're not going to tell your wife. We're not cops. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's a little edema, brain swelling and an area of scarring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Is that what's causing the aphasia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, that's what's odd. The scarring is not in the area of the brain normally associated with conduction aphasia. And it's old. Happened before he hit his head. Maybe a small stroke or some other underlying condition that could be causing this or it might have nothing to do with it at all.  Have you ever had head trauma before? An accident?  Ever had any numbness on one side before? Dizziness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>What is the durable?  No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got you some coffee.  So... what do you want to talk about?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A scarring on the MRI could mean anything; MS, toxins, any one of a hundred demyelinating diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If it's meningitis, we have to ID the bug fast. We need to do a lumbar puncture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not doing an LP with this edema. We could paralyze him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What does House say?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need more information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There is no more information!</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When people give themselves away, it's by little things. That woman over there, she's not sneering at her coffee, she’s recovering from Bell's palsy. And the cashier at the coffee place, she doesn't want anybody to know she's dying of ALS. There's a particular sort of twitchy stiff arm that’s characteristic.  And then there's you. Why aren't you wearing your cross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Oh, I told you I left it--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You keep jewelery cleaner under the sink so you won’t have to go a day without it. True, you forgot it that morning that our pipes burst, but then you went back and waded through the flood to retrieve it. Soo... why no wading today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You didn’t bring a book to read or something?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Caffeine pills, and amphetamines. Same stuff he told us he was taking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Topamax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Anticonvulsive? He said there was no history of prior seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not even prescribed to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still doesn't explain his fever. Probably just using it for weight loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which gives us another lie. Must really be devoted. Should we check the home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He wanted to hide something from his wife, why wouldn’t he hide it in the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then maybe she's hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nothing but aspirin and flu meds in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Looks like this stuff's been sitting here for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hmm, home improvement. He probably thought he could take the project on then realized it was a little more than he could handle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You got a point to make? Or did you just feel like giving a long unnecessary explanation for something medically irrelevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What happened to the Foreman who always has an answer? The guy who practically wears a sign saying "I'm as good as House, but I'm nicer".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I never said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I guess it's safe to be confident when House is there to overrule you. Now that it's all on you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's different. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Either you left it behind on purpose, or by mistake. The only reason you'd leave it behind intentionally, is if it no longer meant anything to you.  But since it was a gift from your mom, that would mean you had a fight with her. But since you don't talk to ghosts, that’s unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Leave it alone, Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm good at that. So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally, but then we'd have to explain why you didn’t go back for it when you realized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I didn't realize until I got to the airport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, you were in make-up when you got to the airport. Can't put on make-up without looking at yourself and you can’t look at yourself without touching that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why does this matter to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Then you're going to suffer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>I think it's his stomach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>A till in the jug.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>I... teelingent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-32"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Are you hungry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-33"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-34"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, he's in pain. Is it a sharp pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-35"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>No!  Teo... indigen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-36"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Taste?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-37"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-38"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A... a metallic taste?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-39"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>YES!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-40"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke, but then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-42"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>We had a fight.  We had a fight and I was angry and not thinking straight, and I walked out without my make-up and without my cross! I stopped at the drug store to buy make-up, but I couldn't buy a cross because they don't have an aisle for personal talismans!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So you had a fight, I'm sure it’ll blow over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-44"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It was about nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course it was. Mark's tired, he's worried, he's got mobility problems. It's normal that he'd blow up over little things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-46"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I don't mind fighting over little things! I don't even mind fighting over big things! That I could understand. But we fight over nothing! You know a mailbox with a sign that says "last pick-up 5pm", does that mean last pick-up to go to the post office, or last pick-up to leave the post office and be sent out of town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You fought over mail delivery? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-48"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I tried to get him to drop the subject, but he wouldn't. I told him he was right, he thought I was being condescending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-49"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-50"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's pushing me out of his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-51"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe you're misinterpreting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-52"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Did I misinterpret with you? At least this time I recognize it. That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you’ve ever loved they're better off without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-53"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-54"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> I'm going to go wash my face so I look like a grown-up again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's perfect. Seems like you really narrowed it down over dinner! Here's the plan, we talk to House--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We've been trying; he's not answering his cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture, there’s no choice anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have to do it just right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge. Is Cuddy there ranting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If I'd known you'd be out of contact--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right. So far only 3 organ systems have failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. Call me when you're done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What do you mean by doing the LP just right? We're not going to screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The odds are this guy knows something we don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He could know the answer to the meaning of life, the man can't communicate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you had any indication that he's tried to communicate something important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's cause you guys haven't scared him enough. I'm sure you’ve been all "oh we'll take read good care of you", why should he say anything? When you prep him, tell him he's going to die. Crush all hope. Don't let Cameron do it. Cuddy, you got a problem with any of that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Really, really hot Indian curry they make with red chili peppers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know what it is! Didn't think it was addictive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're abrasive and annoying and come on way too strong, like... vindaloo curry. And when you're crazy about curry, that's fine but no matter how much you love curry, you have too much of it, it takes the roof of your mouth off. And then you never want to see curry for a really, really long time but you wake up one day and you think... god I really miss curry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Now all we need is the English-aphasic dictionary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A fluent aphasic retrieves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants. They can be filed by sounds or by meaning. So if he wants to say table, he could say... label, or he could say chair. Or he could just say Jabberwocky, there's no way to tell.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you sure you told me everything you found in his home and office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, we're hiding something.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>White. It's a polar bear; you built your house in the North Pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Polar. Whatever your name is, patient! Are you bipolar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's that? I can't see, is he nodding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Topamax isn't just off-labeled for weight loss. It's off-labeled for mood disorders. Plenty of bipolars are manic in the daytime, depressive at night. He's been medicating for years with alcohol and sleeping through the bad hours. It explains the danger journalism, explains everything including the kitchen sink. Ok, technically it's kitchen cabinets. He starts a project, then he stops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it doesn't shut down your kidneys, but what it does do--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>Excuse me sir, can I see your ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm on the phone— I’m on the phone—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>Now please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>Gregory House--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, I'm a Doctor, and this is an emergency call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>You'll have to come with me sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-29"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>You think you're gonna take me on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I kick, and I bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-31"><speaker>Security Guy</speaker><content>You're either on that plane, or you're going into custody. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, you still there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Being bipolar makes you take risks, you seek excitement. You make up stories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-34"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>I dine valutate a lever! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, maybe your stories are legit. People would start to wonder. Annoyed politicians, entire governments would be on your ass. You couldn't tell anybody you were bipolar, which was fine. Until you fell in love.  And you wanted that life. And you hear that there's a surgical cure, give the woman you love the life she wants. All you have to do is change. Bilateral cingulotomy, an experimental surgery that some people claim helps mood disorders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-36"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And if it's done by gamma knife, there's no trace of cutting. That's the neural scarring we saw on the MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-37"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which explained nothing because it wasn't even in the right area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not the surgery, it's the secrecy! What causes recurring fever?  Neurological problems, lethargies that you fight with caffeine pills and amphetamines.  It wasn't your secret psych disorder; it was your secret daily drug use. It was the secret trip, and your secret surgery in Caracas or Buenos Aires, which by the way didn't work given the state of your kitchen cabinets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-39"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House! Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-41"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Is he right?  Your doctors... know you better than I do. That man on the speakerphone, he never even met you and HE knows you better than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-42"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>You love me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-43"><speaker>Fletcher</speaker><content>Ye... Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-44"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>You just don't trust me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get some blood on a slide. Do not put it through a computer this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-46"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yep </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-47"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cerebral malaria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-48"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'll get him started on intravenous quinidine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-49"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If a human being had actually looked at his blood, anywhere along the way, instead of just running tests through the computer... parasites would have jumped right out at them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-50"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Price of the electronic age.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm counting on you to get me off the no-fly list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Is your patient going to be alright?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Physically, his chances are good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Physically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two people who weren't meant to be together. Maybe they’ll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah, that's usually the way it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He loved her enough to convince himself he could change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>But he couldn't, could he?  You know what Woody Allen said about relationships? "Irrational and crazy, but we go through it all because--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>--we need the curry".</content></utterance>
