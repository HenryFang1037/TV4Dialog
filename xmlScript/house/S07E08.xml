<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What you got against chickens? One got choked last night, thanks to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>33-year-old male with hemoptysis, fever…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't we even talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You can't apologize, we can't talk. And puncture wounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Lying to me was not the right thing. Puncture wounds are from a crucifixion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I lied to save my patient's life. I didn't lie to you. I lied to my boss. Either of those arguments working yet?  I guess that means I don't have to go to the wedding on Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The Hospital's Chairman of the Board? I'm not gonna stand him up, and neither are you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I loathe weddings and their seven levels of hypocrisy. But you do seem awfully hissy. And there's an outside chance that I could get you drunk and score. So as long as you don't take it as an admission of guilt, sure, count me in.  A bit too much honesty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You're also going to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. Dressy casual.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Housekeeping. Either you're crazy or you're atoning for something naughty, and you're crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> He's a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>I'm not atoning for anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That answers that. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Stage IV glioblastoma. When the doctors said she had two months to live, that's when I made my bargain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With your health insurance carrier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> With God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>I told him I would nail myself to a cross every year he kept her alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So how did that negotiation go? You lowballed with ear piercing and God countered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Three weeks later, she was cancer-free. And that was four years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pontius Pilate — misunderstood oncologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>My ex-wife thinks I'm crazy too. She moved out the first time I did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Marisa</speaker><content>You don't believe in God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did. Then I grew my curly hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Marisa</speaker><content>So how do you think I was cured?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>You have your answer, doctors. We have ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Causal determinism. We are hardwired to need answers.  The cave man who heard a rustle in the bushes checked out to see what it was lived longer than the guy who assumed it was just a breeze. The problem is, when we don't find a logical answer, we settle for a stupid one. Ritual is what happens when we run out of rational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you're done mocking him, we need to prep for an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you late? Your next dental appointment isn't till January, and you just saw your GP eight days ago.  You think stage IV glioblastoma in an eight-year-old could disappear in three weeks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I had a flat tire. Your patient has cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them. No, and neither does my patient's daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I hit a piece of rebar near a construction site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>In three weeks? It's highly unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's no construction site between here and your home. I agree. I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But there is one between here and my dry cleaner. It could be a misdiagnosis, or it could be spontaneous remission. But… why would I lie about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know yet. But you would have dropped off your tie. It's got a mustard stain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was buying an engagement ring.  I'm gonna propose to Sam at the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today. And I'm surprised how close you came.  You don't need to buy her a new ring. Isn't the first one good for all you can marry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I assume you haven't apologized to Cuddy yet. Your stupidity demands equal time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing to apologize for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Pretend to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me to lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's a lovely symmetry to it. The lie got you into it. A lie gets you out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just need to give her a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, that must have been what I meant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Have you seen the bride-to-be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Gorgeous woman half his age. He's a lucky guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yeah, for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>My father's 19 years older than my mother, and they've been happily married for 32 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm guessing your dad wasn't on the Forbes 400 and your mom didn't look like a swimsuit model. Sorry. That didn't come out right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>My father was the classics chair at Columbia, and my mother was his student. His gorgeous student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What's it mean when somebody takes their cell phone into the bathroom when they're taking a shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It means they don't want you to check their calls, emails, or texts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we're talking about your wife, it means the chickens are coming home to roost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Taub has been known to dabble.  Used to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Maybe it's just a habit. I do that with my cell phone, and I live alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She has a meeting today at 1:30. At a hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Master</speaker><content>I'm gonna go with the chicken thing. Negative for Toxocara, Bacteroides, Ascaris, everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So what looks like an infection but doesn't test like one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sure your wife's just seeing a dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient works for Morgan Timber Works. Card's in the file. Specializing in stables, barns, and stalls. He works around animals. Rhodococcus Equi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Unless this guy's sleeping in the manger…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or has a history of open wounds. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We think you have Rhodococcus Equi, a horse infection. It's pretty rare in humans, but easily treatable with antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Does it make your teeth fall out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Then again, maybe we were wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fever, coughing up blood, coughing up teeth. So either God sweetened the deal with a "no flossing" clause or…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Radiation sickness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe the carpenter builds microwave ovens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Kaposi's sarcoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No skin lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Heavy metal poisoning fits. Canned tuna, sushi, lead paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Heavy metal it is. Do a home search and a peripheral smear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I can't. I have a personal errand to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He stops and turns to Taub) Trying to catch your wife cheating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh… Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shopkeeper. I need a patient file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ask records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not one of our patients. My patient's daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ask your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He thinks I only want it to debunk his faith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And why would he think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I'm going to violate patient privacy laws just to keep you happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You keep me happy, I return the favor. Think of it as tat for tit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>When we're at work, we need to focus on our work thoughts.  Why are you wearing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's my dressy casual. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You look like Wilson. It looks weird. Well, you knew I'd think that. Which makes me wonder why you look disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you prick me, do I not bleed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You knew I wouldn't like it, but you thought I would say I did. That's what this is about. You're trying to trap me into lying to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure? 'Cause that sounds so juvenile. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're okay with burglary now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I asked his permission. The reason we don't ask permission is we're afraid the patient is going to hide something, but our patient hasn't been home, lives alone. He doesn't have any help, and he has no motive to hide anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Did you ask for his key too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Oh, doesn't have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And now we know why. You think he's crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Crucifixion's pretty convincing evidence. Lead paint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The place is too new. He believes in a higher power that can affect his life. Like most people on the planet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>True. On the other hand, crucified himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> No canned tuna. And I don't think we have to worry about sushi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No computer. No television. No music. What does he do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He reads. Prayer's been proven to aid recovery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Only if the person knows they're being prayed for. Means there's no objective effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So faith comes from within. Not exactly a newsflash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I guess worry is good for the waistline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not worry. It's starvation. His tooth didn't fall out because of heavy metal poisoning. It fell out because of malnutrition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He does have Rhodococcus Equi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Taub was right. He just didn't know why.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I'm busy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I really am busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy got me the daughter's file. Well, not Cuddy exactly. Her signature. Well, not exactly her signature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Another lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought you could take a look at it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe you hadn't heard. I'm kind of busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sudoku. What do you think? I'm the head of oncology at a major hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And yet these files are not from this hospital. These are from where-my-fiancee-works memorial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sam's boss is doing a clinical review of all of her files, and she just wanted to make sure everything was in order before he starts on Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which explains why Sam is too busy to look at my file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If I don't help her, she can't go to the wedding and… We fell in love at her cousin's wedding, which is why I want to propose to her at a wedding. And now you have 60 seconds to berate me for that and for helping my girlfriend with her homework.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't want to propose at a wedding. Emotions running high, people on edge. You ought to try somewhere like a Buddhist temple or an aquarium. Or a Buddhist aquarium. That only took ten seconds. You can spend the rest of the time on my file.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Hey. How long before you're home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Not long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, hey. Hey. Uh, you left your laptop on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Saw you today. At the hotel. Were you checking up on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Satisfied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You said you're satisfied. It's enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're not wondering why it started. That makes me think you don't want</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're being paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You took your cell phone with you into the bathroom when you took your shower this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I made a new friend. Online. In a support group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A support group for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>For people with unfaithful spouses.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why didn't you tell us you were starving yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Well, I wasn't trying to. I'm on a tight budget, and it seemed like an okay diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Well, you seem to be felling better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> Not really. My legs are killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>How bad is the pain? On a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> 9 1/2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Then why are you smiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>I'm not smiling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Leg pain and Pseudobulbar Affect. He's feeling one emotion while unknowingly expressing another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Classic Neurohecatia. Two days of anticholinergics, you'll be walking out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I just made that up to see your reaction. Diagnostic test. This is awesome. 33-year-old carpenter presenting with narcissism, delusions of grandeur,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He hasn't had hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about "him" with a capital "o-m-g."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want us to do a differential diagnosis on Jesus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Hears voices, thinks he's the son of God. Probably Schizophrenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you offended him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're saying the patient's religious extremism could be a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A neuro disorder could explain all his delusions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get an MRI of his brain. Let's see if we can find God.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Heard you got the daughter's file. Patient change his mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I forged your signature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you for your honesty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think of it as a present. See, somebody is about to turn the big 4-5 in several months, and somebody else wants to make a very big deal of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> 4-3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>4-3. Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How could I make such a mistake? In reading your HR file? Oh, no, wait, I didn't. And  boom goes the dynamite. Scores are tied. We are even-steven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're right. I did lie. To HR. Not to you. When I first applied for the VP Admin job, I was 29 years old. I knew I would be taken more seriously if I were</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lied to make yourself older? Are you lying about being a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Even if you can trap me, you think I'll suddenly embrace the value of lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My point is you already have. I just need to prove it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Chickens aren't roosting. She's just got a friend. A guy she met in an online support group for cheating spouses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I've heard of that group. It's called irony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think she's cheating on her spouse with someone from a cheating spouse support group?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sounds like the perfect place to hit on vulnerable women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Look.  Multiple dense lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It looks like M.S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>How did we miss M.S.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was hiding behind the malnutrition. M.S. attacks the immune system. No system, no symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And now we're feeding him, so they're both back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> Terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously. Where are your friends? Still casting lots for your clothes?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Always sacrificing. Very inspirational. The lesions are in your temporal lobes. When those areas get messed with, people have strange experiences — like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Deals with God? You didn't come to see if I was better. You came to see if your medicine has turned me into an atheist.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Faith is not a disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, of course not. On the other hand, it is communicable, and it kills a lot of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content> I can't move my arm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Cummerbund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know me. I can't say no to any of you guys. You're all correct. He has M.S. But not the friendly Mr. Rogers M.S. This is the weird guy in the panel van kind.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's unless we can get someone to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible. Or, stem cell treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's an experimental treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's had promising results with demyelinating diseases. It's our best shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It would be if it wasn't embryonic stem cell treatment. Our patient's right of the pope. He's never gonna consent to that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So either God intervened, which is a lazy explanation, or we just don't know why. Which is no explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sometimes there is no explanation. And I'm just fine with that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yeah. That's what I thought.  I asked her point blank about this. She said the dosages were accurate and that she had done nothing wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause morally she didn't. All five patients were terminal. She exceeded the dosing protocols to try to save their life. You would have done the same. She's a sap, and she's perfect for you. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Taking painkillers breaks my deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The point is to suffer like your savior did, right? Well, he didn't take myrrh, the Tylenol of ancient Rome. And his nails went through his wrists, not through his palms. Palms are for sissies. And what about the 39 lashes and the beatings and the crown of thorns? What you go through is closer to a bad manicure than a crucifixion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>It's not about showing God my pain. It's about showing him my faith. If he asks me to die for my daughter, I'll do it gladly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't make this about your daughter.  You're just worried that if we find a cure, that it'll cost you your faith. And then you'll be like the rest of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Alone and afraid? You're right. I don't want that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You're smiling. Does that mean that you're comfortable with your choice? Or that you're afraid? Because this may be your only hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>You can prescribe a lot of things, but hope isn't one of 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sticking by your convictions and damning the consequences. You two have a lot in common. You're both idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>All conviction's equally ridiculous?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So you know you may be wrong. How could you do what you just did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>That's why we have beliefs. So we can still see the right thing to do when we're blinded with doubt and fear. Our beliefs define us. If we lose them, who are we?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is a lie.  You were married before. 1987 for six days.  Your knowledge of New Jersey divorce law made me suspicious, so I looked it up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Ramon</speaker><content>Yes, it did. They tested her every year. With a CT scan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God. You broke your deal with him, your daughter's fine, you're getting better. Nothing bad happened. Which can only mean one thing. There is no God. Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We had a fight. We had one fight. And I admitted I was wrong. We can talk about it. We can get over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>This is about trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I never lied to you about anything.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've been an idiot. I got this argument stuck in my head. If everybody lies, then trust is not only unfounded and pointless, it's fictional. But trust is not an argument that can be won or lost. Maybe I just have to suspend my cynicism and believe. Maybe it's time I took a leap of faith.  I'm sorry. I won't lie to you again.</content></utterance>
