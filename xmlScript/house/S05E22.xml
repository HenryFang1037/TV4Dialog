<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> You look like superman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> I’m nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> You’re going to kick ass.  I think your mom’s trying to get your attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> Check it out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> You’re not deaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> Gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> Good luck.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> House. House. I know you’re not asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren’t just a product of my exhausted brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Aren’t you curious about why I’m here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Curious why no French maid’s outfit. No spanky pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>I’m a hallucination, not a fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can cause—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>That might explain why you’re hallucinating. Doesn’t explain why you’re hallucinating Wilson’s dead girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Or maybe your guilt over Kutner’s suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares why you’re here. A decent night’s sleep, you won’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Guess I’ll be around a few more hours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Need some coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Addictive substances are no substitute for nature’s healing balm.  Make this fast. I need to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient went deaf at age four. Complication of meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>So why no cochlear implant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Usual suspects are insomnia, which he doesn’t have; migraines, which he doesn’t get; and head trauma, which didn’t show up on the CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Damn imaginary pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Mom’s signature’s on everything. Did Dad die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical records couldn’t be cleaner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we’re left with temporal lobe seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>You’re going to ignore your own subconscious? Gonna be the limp leading the blind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a scrip for sleeping pills. My neighbor’s dog’s been keeping me awake and seems strangely invulnerable to poison.  Why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ll take that as a congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’re discussing a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Why did he close that file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wedding in two weeks? I’d say you were pregnant but I don’t think Chase’s body is mature enough to produce sperm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s a small ceremony. Why wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Nighty night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Drugs with no lecture? He wants you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Possible prostate cancer came into the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Pencil cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ho! No wonder his prostate’s enlarged. It’s full of pool cues and cigars. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chase’s best man doesn’t get here till the day of the wedding so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No retired ministers available to plan it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Chase doesn’t want some big, raucous party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, no, no. I don’t want — I don’t want you to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank… towards the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> I get to help, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Starting five hertz. House made it through that entire differential without mocking our patient for not having a cochlear implant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The patient doesn’t want an implant because he’s comfortable with who he is. It’s admirable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s deaf. It’s not an identity, it’s a disability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’s also a culture. The deaf have their own schools, their own language.  Still no spiking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Going to 20. Anything I can simulate with a $3.00 pair of earplugs is not a culture. No sign of seizure. Temporal lobe activity is still clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Doctors, doctors. He can’t see. One of his eyes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The limp leading the blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is that supposed to mean something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Subclavian steel syndrome. Vascular defect coupled with constant arm movement could siphon blood flow from the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We should do an angio—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Knock yourselves out.  How did I know he was gonna go blind?  Don’t get cute, Gazoo. You’re in my mind. You’re obviously there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>C-reactive protein. I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated. I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation even higher. Lead to optic neuritis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s a lot clearer than “the limp leading the blind.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It was just a glimmer. I couldn’t put it into words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was a long shot. I don’t even remember the c-reactive protein level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Obviously you do. You just don’t know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How high is K2?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Me neither. But I read a book about it years ago. Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>28,251 feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool. An all-access pass to my own brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Go play the kid some music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Another long shot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re using iodine dye to track the blood flow in your neck and arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does it look like I’m doing? Fighting the power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>You’re an ass.  He says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s a new symptom. Neuropathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Thought you were gonna get some sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Case got interesting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like the zoo. Except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How did you know about the neuropathy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Enough with the riddles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Think “wrestling record.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Juggling. No, pins. Three pins. Patient was pinned in his last three matches. Leading up to that he was 15 and 0. I figured his balance was off from diminished sensation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That we missed on the head CT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He just went up a weight class three months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Foreman’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, increased ICP could make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You just said—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was processing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It also puts a new symptom on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his childhood meningitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So meningitis was a coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you’re right about NF2, his deafness may be reversible. I’ll set it up and talk to the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You two… doing anything?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know what a broken cowboy is?  It was on House’s list of requirements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I have three theories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Why is House so into this bachelor party thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He needs a reason to be into a bachelor party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He needs a reason to be into anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Give me your wallet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House could be trying to tempt Chase into cheating. Break them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You think House is into Cameron? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think House is into Cameron being into him. Marrying Chase would shatter that fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If Chase cheats then they shouldn’t be getting married in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you’re okay with House getting Chase smashed enough to make a stupid mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Being drunk doesn’t change who you are. It just reveals it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think she can do the broken cowboy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>God, I hope so.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>NF2 is an extremely slow-growing cancer which makes it very treatable. If we’re right, taking out the tumor means there’s a chance you’ll regain your hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> No</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> He said you have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>He wants you to treat the cancer but leave him deaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry. Doesn’t work like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> It will be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> I’d have to change schools. I’d barely see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> You won’t see me at all unless you get better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves. It’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indicate a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We brought pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The fact that you sent me on a scouting mission—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>No skirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not on the guest list. Bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The ventricle bowing is most likely a pre-existing anatomical anomaly, not the indication of a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No way to know for sure without a brain biopsy. If I get drunk enough, there’s a chance I might make out with one of the strippers. Or become one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House and Amber</speaker><content>Sold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We can’t just drill into our patient’s brain on a hunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House and Amber</speaker><content> Oh, God, not her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Taub’s right. It’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it’s difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Or an older look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The mom’s never gonna let us touch his brain without some evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Patient broke his nose years ago. Hospital could have done an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House’s bachelor party.  Have you seen Caligula?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> My patient’s brain now… versus three years ago.  See any difference?  Is he telling you to avoid the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I took an oath to do no harm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. Don’t come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This should be interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are going to commit to that one special woman forever. Which is beautiful. But if your commitment the day after the wedding is the same as your commitment the day before, then the wedding meant nothing. So, and I see no logical way around this, if you want your marriage to matter, you have to be a wanton, trolling, muck-covered pig the day before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You’re evil. Se ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> The wall of the fourth ventricle changed. It isn’t bowed in the older scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Evidence of NF2, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’d need to do a brain biopsy to confirm.  Uh, I’m not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> It’s not okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Do you know who we need?  That stripper you got for Wilson’s bachelor party. You could do body shots right off her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson’s party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>She loved cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What made you remember the stripper loved cats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Chase has a cat. They’ll bond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What’d you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The biopsy shows nerve inflammation consistent with increased intracranial pressure. Something’s wrong, but it’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>He’s going to go through life deaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>He has no idea what he’s missing. His mom’s a moron. He’s gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life? Are *we* okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wasn’t in the paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I’ll go track it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ll wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s a great idea. Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ll wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda. An implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Let’s get an implant tray in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just… Just try to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> What did you do to me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Her son didn’t want the implant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he still doesn’t want it, after having time to adjust, I’ll take it out. I’ll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Remove it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid’s just had brain surgery. He’s not stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ms. Miller, I’m not trying to minimize Dr. House’s wrongdoing, but the best thing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Why is she sitting?  She’s not yelling, not threatening, not pacing.  Just sitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Understand, Dr. House?  House. Focus. I need you to say you accept the arrangement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No problem.  You’re not mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>I’m mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not mad enough. You wanted your son to hear. You just didn’t have the guts to make him get the implant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Once my son is stable, I want that thing out of his head. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why did you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he is ignorant and he’s being raised by an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not good enough. You always have—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> My patient is opting into a handicap! It’s an insult to all the other gimps out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay. But I’m still putting Foreman in charge of the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s the arrangement?  Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, about that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>You think we did the wrong thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not sure.  I’m not even sure why we did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Well, that argument you made to Cuddy sounded pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To you, maybe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huh. I figured by now you’d be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. You did something stupid. Quick, better mock someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why did I give a human being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he’ll give you the same answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient has a fever now too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Probably just a post-op complication. Arnold-Chiari?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not without muscle weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pseudotumor Cerebri?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We checked his eyes before the surgery. No papilledema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Candy.  I’m pretty sure Wilson’s stripper’s name was something sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe his fever is more than the post-op reaction. His girlfriend was sick a few months ago.  Maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Lolly? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>They swap spit, virus travels to his brain, leads to meningitis, leads to increased intracranial pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>I agree. Taffy? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Go ahead. Start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you’re in charge.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why aren’t you in my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because I know what the word “my” means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did something insane, and you’re not all over me analyzing why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It was nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he’s been. How is that nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn’t do it to solve the case. You didn’t do it to save his live. You… did it to make his life better. It was a caring act — which you did in a way that was immoral and illegal, but… Baby steps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Doesn’t sound like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And you’re okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What choice do I have? </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> Say it again, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Seth.  Oh. I think he just wet the bed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Kid’s dehydrated but stable. Thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table. Now eat up. We’re gonna pick out the ice cream flavors for the bachelor party. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be systemic autoimmune disease, sarcoido — This tastes like… vodka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That’s the brown one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It is vodka?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Flash frozen in a secret process. Guy figured it out in his basement.  Limoncello. Genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The symptoms came on too hard and too fast. Sarcoidosis is progressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> Remember in med school when Donovan gave grand rounds? There was that guy who was peeing liters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Glomerulonephritis? A wrestler. Steroids could have damaged the kidneys. Hmm. The scotch is nice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His urine would have been brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Donovan ruled out osmotic diuresis — kidney disease. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pheochromocytoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No hypertension. Plasma metanephrine’s normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Devic’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It happened at night. That was the clue. Night, recumbent body position, changes in BP</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s his heart.  Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>You’re getting better at focusing. Ignoring everything that doesn’t matter.  Uh-oh. He looks pissed. I think he might hit us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is your eyesight better than mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to talk about the bachelor party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excellent topic choice. Surgery’s so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s my fault for letting you talk me into the implant. Cameron is not going to be happy about this party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you, on the other hand—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So… I need to cancel the fart band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So… I need you to kidnap me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spoken like a true Aussie. By the way, if you know where I can get me the sheet music to Waltzing Matilda…  Hey. Want some ice cream? We’re having a sundae bar. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sweet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> That’s her name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sundae or bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Karamel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With a “K.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> I wish I could get an implant too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> You don’t need one. No one does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> It’s a great thing. It’s going to open up a whole new world for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> I don’t want a new world. This doesn’t have to change things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> I’ll be back in a minute.  Bathroom? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Down the hall, two doors on your right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content> Do I… sound like… her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It takes time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You still haven’t slept?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And then I have a clever response. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>EKG normal sinus, normal intervals. His heart’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>His heart’s not fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia’s hiding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or we were wrong about the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be the thyroid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hashimoto’s would explain the kid’s urine and brain pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Treadmill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or, the arrhythmia is hiding. We need to stress him. Put the patient on a treadmill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient just had brain surgery. A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re not doing this. You haven’t been sleeping—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy doesn’t actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And if I let you risk our patient’s life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman’s sign-off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We could kill Foreman.  Is she new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it’s not simulated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s a tough sell since she never leaves the room for more than five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>We could kill her.  Or… Asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Revealing the arrhythmia.  Nice idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>It was yours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>I just left the room for a few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He ripped out his implant. So much for improving his life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Actually, I think we just saved it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at that. Arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were right about the heart. Should have listened to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The correct phrasing would be, “I should always listen to you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He’s got problems everywhere. What goes everywhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Blood. Could be thrombocythemia. Excess platelets lead to clotting throughout the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not with a normal platelet count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So the clotting doesn’t start in the blood. It starts in the lungs. Pulmonary embolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure I did this at Wilson’s party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Last time you used grain alcohol instead of the Sambuca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> This is why we’re rehearsing. Ever wonder what’s happening every time our patient gets sicker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>First symptom, wrestling. Then, under the lights of the seizure lab—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feels—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Just keep doing what you’re doing. It helps. Then, under the stress of blindness… and post-op fever. What do all the symptoms have in common?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Heat. See, if you hadn’t been here that would have just popped into my head. Which actually would have been way cooler.  Foreman. The kid’s got Uhthoff Phenomenon. Which means it’s MS. Start him on double-dose interferon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Let’s get our drink on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not before I’ve added “chemical burns” to this guy’s cause of death.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Patient’s responding to interferon. Looks like I can retire as department figurehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Male Officer</speaker><content>Dr. Robert Chase? We’re with the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. Did you recently apply for a marriage license?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Uh… Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Male Officer</speaker><content>According to our records, your work permit is expired. If you could come with us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Um, I’m his fiancé. I can come along and clear this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Female Officer</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Ma’am. Illegals only.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I’m… I’m sure it’s a mistake. I’ll call you as soon as I know what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Don’t let House get him in too much trouble.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A-huh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now, ah, a few ground rules for the evening. Uh, safety is job one. We’ve now gone for 18 days without an injury in the workplace.  Uh, yes, these girls are all working their way through law school. Don’t test them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I knew you couldn’t stay away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> This is my apartment. You can’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clearly, reality begs to differ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Where’s my furniture?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eh. I kinda like it in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content> Me too. To us, figuring out MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did.  What exactly did my team do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Looked good in their lab coats. Except for Taub. Some people just work better alone… so to speak.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, you in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Use the other bathroom. It’s in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper’s body butter or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One of the residents had an epi pen, so he’s fine but we’re taking him to the hospital to be safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay.  I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn’t I?  That’s why you wanted Karamel at this party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>I suggested Karamel ‘cause she was great at Wilson’s party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don’t want Cameron.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hello.  You confirm?  Thanks.  That kid we saved… He’s dying. It’s not MS. We were wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What causes lung failure plus your patient’s previous symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Amber</speaker><content>Eosinophilic pneumonitis. White blood cells accumulate, clog up the lungs, lead to heart problems. It fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, are you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not eosinophilic pneumonitis. I gotta crash.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Eonsinophilic pneumonitis could actually make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, House ruled it out because it would affect the larynx. Patient would be… hoarse. Which we wouldn’t notice in a deaf kid who rarely speaks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> But that means taking out the tube. Isn’t that dangerous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It’s the safest way to confirm what’s wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I need him to breathe out as I pull out the tube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> Breathe out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Say “ah.” </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Seth</speaker><content>Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m sorry. We were wrong. I need to, uh, suction out your throat before we reintubate.  Your son smoke?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tobacco stains on his teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> He says he used to chew tobacco to cut weight for wrestling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Used to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Chewing tobacco wouldn’t explain his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But not chewing tobacco might. Taub was right. It’s sarcoidosis. The tobacco releases toxins. Those toxins suppressed his immune system. Once he quit chewing, the absence of those toxins kicked a dormant condition into hyper-drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content>Is it treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate. I’ll start the meds.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Ellie</speaker><content> And then you ripped it out rather than live with it for a few days even. I’m your mother. This is my call. I don’t know if I’m making the right one, but it’s mine to make.</content></utterance>
