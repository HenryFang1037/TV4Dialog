I was also wondering if you could take a look at these, when you have a chance.  No hurry, it’s just a couple of medical histories, one with a minor cancer concern –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>Jesse Baker’s granddaughter. You always said you’d give your right hand to play like him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s how babies are made.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don’t think she was expecting your sympathy. I think her point was New Orleans was a third-world country: toxins, mold, sewage in the streets…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if her heart is like my bike? Runs like crap when I’m by myself, but take it to the mechanic and it runs great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>An arrhythmia, a one time event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are we going to do, keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until she has another arrhythmia? That could be weeks, months! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax, I happen to know she’s going to have one right after lunch. We are golden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You can’t induce an arrhythmia in someone whose heart gave out nearly 48 hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure you can, but it’s kinda technical – you stick all these cool little wires inside her somehow, and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I mean you shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, right, because it would be much more ethical to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting. There’s always a team of cardiologists sitting at the next table, this is Jersey! She’s a minor, she’s going to need consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ll go talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, that’s an excellent plan! You’ll give him the form and tell him it’s wrong and dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I can handle a simple consent form.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stay in character! I’m so scared. Hold me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>In order to figure out which circuit is misfiring, we need to map all the electrical activity in her heart.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a map of the electrical pathways of the heart. We send electricity to each, one at a time, until one fails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>It sounds dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a risk I am prepared to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>If she’s got an electrical problem, couldn’t more electricity blow her whole system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, who’s been watching Bill Nye the Science Guy? The test is perfectly safe. We do it every day.  And you believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>I shouldn’t do the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s crazy dangerous. Just sign the damn form. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>What she’s been through… why would you assume –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because of what she’s been through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>Because that’s your default position, always has been!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because she’s still alive! Raised by a junkie, living off the streets, that tends to kick the sweetness out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>Figured you’d have mellowed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s because you’re an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>If I let you do the test, it means I don’t trust her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wilson? Cameron, maybe you mentioned it to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I’m a really good secret keeper. I never told anyone that Wilson wets his bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Part of the protocol for in vitro fertilization is twice-daily injections of menotropins. I can’t do it myself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No clever comments about bending over?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m just not used to House the professional. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was just thinking about what your mother looked like, because your father obviously chose her for breeding purposes –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Natural selection sucks. We pick our mates based on breast size, cars they drive…. They did autopsies on married couples and found correlations in pancreas size. We’re hardwired to pick for stupid reasons, you have the chance to pick for smart reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I think the Germans had a similar theory about 60 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not advocating wiping out entire races, I’m just saying you don’t want to mate with the first plastic cup that buys you a drink. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We were 20 years old, he had a car. If he had been a woman, I would have married him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is he a match?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Lying girl lucked out and found one in the registry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is he the dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lab results from the black ooze. You’re not going to believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She pooped out of her mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The sample contained stool and digested blood, how did you guess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Cause it oozed; if it was in her stomach it would have sprayed, if it was in her lungs she would have coughed. This oozed, as in squeezed, as in reverse peristalsis. Who’s hungry, Mexican takeout?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In order for there to be digested blood in her intestines there had to be internal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, and for whatever in her intestines to come back up there had to be a blockage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Liver failure. There'd be no proteins to clot the blood so it would clot the blood and mess up her intestines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours. We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real problem is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, need to talk to you. The good news is she doesn’t have an autoimmune condition, so she doesn’t need a bone marrow transplant and we were able to stop the radiation in time. The bad news: she has potty mouth. Her liver is failing, she’s made her digestive system go in reverse. It’s actually much worse than it sounds. We need to do a liver biopsy. I don’t know what’s going to happen when we stick a needle into her liver, but she could die right then and there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>You need to tell me what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No inside information on this one. But Crandall, three days ago you didn’t even know this girl. If she’d been hit by a bus you wouldn’t lose a moment’s sleep. There are people all over this hospital who are in just as much trouble and just as not related to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>You telling me I shouldn’t care? Prep me to handle it, in case she dies?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s brown, it’s lumpy… I’m going to heave all over my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Chicken mole. 21 herbs and spices. I find it very comforting, you defending a man you haven’t seen in years. To know my friend, no matter what, will always be my champion, my protector.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not protecting him, I’m smacking her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The modesty of a true hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Push me and I’ll let her die, just so you’ll stop annoying me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Here’s my theory: you’re jealous. He’s maturing, he’s accepting responsibility, you’re emotionally stuck at seventeen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s manufacturing responsibility, he’s not maturing. He hasn’t changed at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So then, why do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That black ooze we saw? That was a bowel movement. Out of her mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re trying to end this conversation by grossing me out? I’m an oncologist. Half of my patients have their skin sloughing off. Why are you so worried about this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was having a rough time with his girlfriend. He was in love, he was always in love. He wanted to marry her, but I thought she was flaky, sending mixed signals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So, you gave him advice and she dumped him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I told him that I would talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And you blew it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Technically…  I was doing him a favor, she was nuts! </content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Please tell me you didn’t have us stop the biopsy to check out some tunes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His left hand is very subtle, very delicate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This girl is dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Be dying a lot faster if I let you do that obviously unnecessary biopsy. Now listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Jesse Baker</speaker><content>I asked for this tuned! Did you get this instrument tuned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>My God! Grandpa was an angry drunk, if only we’d known!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here’s how to become a great artist. First, get miserable. Misery drives you to become a great artist, but the art does nothing for your misery, which drives you to drugs, which makes you a lousy artist, and this is not lousy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You’re saying he didn’t do drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not when he played this. Something was screwing with his personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, drugs and alcohol don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And that note that he says is out of tune, it’s not, which means that something is screwing with his aural perception, too. Now, what happens when you add all that to the liver disease, which he supposedly died of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Too much iron. He could have had hemochromatosis, that’s genetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Unless you can tell me Miles Davis couldn’t play stoned –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Played better when he wasn’t. I think, I mean, no one knows for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’ll get Leona a TIBC and serum ferritin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can test this in three minutes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what is she, Foreman? Light-skinned black chick or dark-skinned white chick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not sure. Can we hear the music again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s too early to see jaundice from the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. This is a photograph of Leona when she was 13 years old. She’s darker now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s been living on the streets for eight months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No tan line, so unless those streets she’s been living on are indoor streets, I’m thinking she’s got iron deposits in her melanin, both byproducts of hemochromatosis, just like Granddad used to make. SQUID exam to calculate the amount of iron in her blood. And treat her with deferoxamine, she’ll be fine by lunch. ‘Cause, you see, I was wrong before, about the breakfast….</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s the iron, and lots of it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a done deal. I knew it the moment I saw you. Interview’s just a formality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, what are you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lisa Cuddy, this is Patrick Glidahan. Patrick’s going to be the new intern rotating in my department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I didn’t even know you were looking for one, nice to meet you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Patrick</speaker><content>Sorry. I laugh when I’m nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bet you’ve been doing that your whole life, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What kind of medicine are you interested in, Patrick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Patrick</speaker><content>Cancer, infectious disease, the big devils. I think that medicine has become too institutionalized. We need to send a message to our patients that we’re just like them. I mean, we’re all people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re all people. I like that. She’s all hard science, facts. I like to know a person’s hopes and dreams. What kind of music do you like, Patrick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Patrick</speaker><content>I’m a Mozart man. He says what I feel, but can’t express.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m late for a meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You see, this is why the face-to-face interview is so important. You’ve got to know who you’re getting in bed with.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Crandall</speaker><content>What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Crash cart! She’s not getting any air. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>CT shows her lungs are Swiss cheese. Ventilator’s helping, but at this point, her time is basically up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We developed a theory: hemochromatosis. Like good scientists we tested that theory, we proved that theory. We acted based on that proof and we treated her. As a result of which, she is on the verge of death. Is it just me, or have we discovered a flaw in the scientific method? Walk me through it, step-by-step. What is supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s a chelating agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does the chelating do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Removes excess iron from the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Iron is heavy, it gets stuck. Deferoxamine is like a lubricant. It makes the iron slick so it can move around again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Moves around where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s supposed to be discharged through waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her waste system is a little screwy right now, means the waste can’t go where it wants to go. What if it went to the lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whatever’s in the lungs likes iron, bound with it, started poking holes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What likes iron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oxygen attaches itself to iron, which increases the chance of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And when we started massive antibiotics prior to the radiation…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Some neurodegenerative diseases like iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her MRI was clean, no iron deposits on the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fungus likes iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No objections to that one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If a fungus is doing all this, she’s dead. There are 25 anti-fungals, if we don’t know which –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When in doubt, go broad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Most common is Aspergillus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Continue to ventilate her lungs, get her on a voriconazole drip, hope she has Aspergillus.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cotton ball? I don’t care if you marry this guy, date this guy, go through his garbage, but you should know. Genes matter. Who you are matters. Find somebody you trust.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, Ingrid! Hi. Okay, you feel guilty about stealing the guy’s girl, I get that, and I’m glad. It’s a good thing. But you did the paternity test. And either the paternity test comes back negative and you shove it in the guy’s face, or it comes back positive and you shut up and your leg starts hurting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or I never ran the test.  Not what you think!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Leona’s lung’s collapsed. The treatment’s not working, we’ve got the wrong fungus.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, the one thing we know for sure is she was not living in the children’s shelter in Ridgeland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why would he lie about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He wouldn’t, if he believed her story about the sweet little girl trying to do the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We can’t ask Leona where she was, she’s intubated.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t try to talk, you’ve got a big medical thing in your mouth. Just blink if you understand.  Fantastic. Blink if you lied to Crandall about everything. You picked up a fungus somewhere. If you were living in the shelter like you told your new daddy I got nothing to go on, and you will die. So, did you lie to Crandall? You’re a lousy con artist. First rule of the game is know your mark. Once you got Crandall to bite on the poppet thing you had him. You could have told him that you were servicing Al Qaeda’s suicide bombers for crack, this guy would still let you pick out the colors in your new room. Did you lie to Crandall?  Where were you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Recording studios. Why are these buildings different from all other buildings?</content></utterance>
