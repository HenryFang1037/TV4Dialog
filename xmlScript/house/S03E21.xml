<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> Mom, I've seen him sick. I'm not scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content>This time's different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content>Doctors gave him an extra course of radiation and chemo...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> And you understand how proud we are of you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> Gloves, mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> Matty, you said you wanted to see your brother before the procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>NICK</speaker><content> I know I look like an alien, but... I-I promise not to eat your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>When this is done, will you be able to play out back with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>NICK</speaker><content>I'll rip anything you put near the strike zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Let your brother rest up while we take some of your marrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You don't need to be in an isolation room, but I pulled some strings so you could be next door to your brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>How many games will I miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Well, you only have to be here overnight, but you do have to take it easy for a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> I already missed two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> Matty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I know. It's okay. Musta been a drag. We just had to make sure you weren't exposed to any bugs. Because your healthy bone marrow is what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia--</content></utterance>

</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He sneezed. Maybe it's just an allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Not with an enlarged spleen and a fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He's got one of ten thousand possible infections. Even if it's just the common cold, I do the transplant, he kills his brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>How long do we have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Radiation obliterated his immune system. Even in a clean room, he's only got... four, maybe five days left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>No way we can solve this that fast. You need to find another donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>They're African-American. It makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Tell me about it. I can't even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ha! Nothing like a dead patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hey! You're not gonna believe what happened. Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He's not dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Five days are gonna fly by. He didn't look both ways before he nuked.  You done talking to your imaginary friend? Because I thought maybe you could do your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> We should start the donor brother on broad-spectrum antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid. Broad-spec will take at least a week to work. We need narrow-spec.  How old is Hector?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Our patient's name is Matty. His brother's Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Hector's my dog. He's about seventeen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Seventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in human years. Why's he still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Five days minus twenty seconds talking about Wilson's dog. We need to start testing. Stool samples for parasites, antibody tests...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, that... probably needs further explanation. We make the donor kid sicker. We freeze him, we soak him, break down his immune system. Suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>True, but who cares? Once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it. As long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We should do what we normally do - Go to the kid's house, check for sources of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Waste of time. You think it's in the house. I know it's in the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Fine. Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>So e-exactly h-how sick are you gonna make Matty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He could get quite ill. This certainly won't be a pleasant experience for anyone, but it's our onl...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Ever get caught in the rain without an umbrella? That's all we're talking about here. Sign the form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It's a little more complicated than that. We'll also be doing leukopheresis. We run Matty's blood through a machine that filters out his white blood cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content>But without his white cells, how can he get better in time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>We'll pump the white blood cells back as soon as we have a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Then we should be able to cure the infection in time to do the transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>But you can't guarantee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We're not GM! No recalls, no rebates. Any more questions while your son's life slips away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> You really think we should do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes!  Sorry, your patient. You tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> This is your family. It needs to be your decision.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>All you had to do was say, "Yes, I do." God knows that's a phrase you've used often enough in your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It was a mistake every time. Give it a break. They said yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That's not enough for you. You need them to feel good about saying yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> I treat patients for months, maybe years, not weeks like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I'm taller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>If they don't trust me, I can't do my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The only value of that trust is you can manipulate them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You should write greeting cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>At least it would've been their choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>One they'd regret at their son's funeral.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate. Whatever the kid's got, he didn't get here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> No-o, whatever the kid got, he didn't get from the kitchen or the bathroom. Nobody cleans swing sets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yeah, because their kid's ten and hasn't used it since he was six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You obviously think your time could be better spent. Why'd you come along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Feel bad about what happened last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I'm handling it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Family's gonna sue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>She only had her grandparents and they weren't close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Well, that's good. For you, I mean. A lawsuit makes it even harder to put behind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You put yours behind you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I woke up this morning, I-I couldn't remember what she was wearing when I admitted her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Memories fade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>FOREMMAN</speaker><content>I killed her a week ago and I can't remember what colour top she was wearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> I was grateful when I could wake up not thinking about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I'm not like you. Your patient died because you were distracted over the death of your dad. I made a calculated decision. You acted like a human being. I acted like... House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Could be mucor or strongyloides in this dirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No pulmonary symptoms. He's setting well, breathing easily.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> Mom, I'm freezing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>How long do I have to...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Hey Matty, we found an old water pump in your backyard. You ever drink from it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> Yeah, it was gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We gotta test for mycobacteria, leptospirosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>When did you drink the water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>L-Last summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You sure? You haven't even taken a sip to cool off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>It was really gross. My shoulder's bugging me. Does that matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It could. Did you do anything to hurt it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>Just threw the ball around the other day for a couple of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's probably just a muscle ache. Let us know if it gets worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>So soreness and stuff, th-that's not 'cause I'm sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Something else bugging you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content>Sort of.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He has acute scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke? The best thing about big honkin' gonads -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Can Chase and Cameron cover that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Mind if I ask why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I want to recheck the national marrow registry for an alternate donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>In case we're wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's been known to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine. Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Negative for E. Coli and TB. Why is House taking it easy on Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He deserves a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Yeah, House is all about giving breaks to people in need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No on klebsiella.  And it's Tuesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It's got nothing to do with Foreman or House. It's just... It's the day I remind you I like you, and I want us to be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Thank you. I'd forgotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No on brucella and both viral antibodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You're really gonna do this every Tuesday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You take the day off, I'll pick it up on Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What if we're looking for the wrong thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>These are the only infections that cause swollen testicles. Why don't you just say it four times now and leave me alone for a month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What if it's not an infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>His temperature's through the roof. There's mucus pouring out of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>I know he has an infection, but what if it didn't directly cause the scrotum issue? What if it just caused the thing that caused the scrotum issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>CKMB is elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Slightly. There's nothing wrong with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Indicates cardiac injury. We stuck him in that room, put his stupid little runny nose infection into hyperdrive. What if it went to his heart?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Pulmonary valve looks clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Wait. Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Mitral valve. There's a growth.  He'll need a month of antibiotics to clear that. His brother only has four days to live.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> The infection in Matty's...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>...mitral valve rules him out as a donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>This is perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>We drove the infection into his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay. Perfect is too strong a word. But it's very, very good. Now we know where the infection is. All we gotta do is remove the valve, ID the infection, target and destroy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Remove the valve? He'll be fine on antibiotics. He doesn't need open heart surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Either way, he's got a dead brother. The infection isn't just in the valve. Even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We don't have to. We have to clear his marrow. After the surgery, harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Could work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's insane!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It is better than a dead brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I'm running this by Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>This surgery is dangerous and life-altering. And clearly not in the interest of our patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It is if he likes his brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We have a conflict of interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>The parents don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Of course they do. They already sacrificed Matty's health to benefit his brother once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>They made his cold worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We screwed up his heart valve by making his cold worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Do you have anything to add to this debate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too revealing for the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>We should call Child Services and have them appoint a guardian for Matty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No.  Go explain the choices to the parents. And don't let House bully them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>House. Did he really think I was gonna do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Then why did you let him...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Tried to cut him some slack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Nice of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think he's got the yips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Steve Blass, Scott Norwood, David Duval. All got the yips. Great athletes. Lost their confidence, and immediately started sucking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>And you're... giving him time to work through it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Mm-hmm! Four days, then he's fired. You don't get better from the yips.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> Open-heart surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If you want both kids to live, it's the only choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Due to the valve replacement, Matty will have to be on blood thinners to prevent potential clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>For how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Forever. He couldn't participate in contact sports because of the risk of haemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> What about the marrow registry? Maybe they'll find a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I'm afraid finding a viable new donor isn't something we can realistically depend on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> Either we cripple one son or kill the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He won't be able to play baseball. But that doesn't make him a cripple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> What should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You should protect your family as a whole. You should do the surgery.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That was awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I gotta start pretending to care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I did exactly what Cuddy told us not to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You've gotta be kidding me. You're actually upset. You just said what you believed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I also believe in patients making their own choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're soothing your conscience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>By that logic, a sociopath would make the best patient advocate in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Am I blushing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> You ready?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>MATTY</speaker><content> Think I'll be better in time to pitch in the playoffs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CLAUDIA</speaker><content> Maybe next season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> We should have told him.</content></utterance>
