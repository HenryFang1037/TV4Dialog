<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, just fighting off a stomach bug. I'll be fine. Did he sleep ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>Great. As long as I was holding him. Can't wait for colic to be over.  Oh shhh... come on Mikey, bathtub's coming.  He lifted his head yesterday. Take the day off, I mean you're sick anyway and you hardly ever see him. Or me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>I can't. I got a meeting with Crandall's kitchens; I think that deal's going to close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>They called about the car payment again. Its two months late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>We're going to be fine, honey. Enjoy your bath little man </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You know honey; I don't think I'm going to go in. I'm coming down with something. Honey? Kara?  Kara?  Kara!  Mikey! Mikey! Kara! Mikey!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>4-week old infant submerged in the bathtub. Don't know how long, non-responsive at the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Obviously breathing now. Continue to blow by stat portable test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Caucasian female, 32, catatonic seizure in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>Where... where am I? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You're in the hospital, honey, you're in the hospital. Mikey's here and the doctor say he's going to be ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hopefully. He needs to be checked out by the NICU.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You passed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>Mikey fell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Has your wife had a seizure before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>I can't move my head, I want to see him!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tonight. L Word marathon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You watch the L Word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On mute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll pass.  Dinner with Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids? They really ought to save their energy for other things. Like crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's the suck up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She asked you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's smart. She knows if she buys me enough alcohol, my defences just might be weakened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn't make sense. Unless she ran out of batteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, I'm recently single, she's single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're too nice for her to like you; she's not needy enough for you to like her. She's got an agenda, just not one that includes an appearance by 'little Jimmy'. I'll poll my peeps.  How many of you think that Cuddy asked--  or rather peep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chase got a case in the ER; he wants us to take a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless Chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony, he had no reason to be in the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cuddy put him on a 2-week NICU rotation. Patient had an unexplained seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seizures are cool to watch, boring to diagnose. What about Foreman? He needs to get his malingering butt back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He almost died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Almost being the operative word .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hey. How are you doing? You look great. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thanks. I feel great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Glad you're back. Cameron makes lousy coffee. Take mine black, the way I take my brain-damaged neurologists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Happy to help. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How are you coming along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell her everything is great. Neither of us wants to deal with her guilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don't feel guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course not, hell if people felt guilt every time they accidentally lobotomised a guy...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was trying to save his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, your heart was in the right place.  It's just his brain that's not quite where it's supposed to be.  Tell her everything's great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's true. No more left-side right-side reversals, still some short-term memory loss and spatial processing problems but trying not to be too hard on myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, might pull a muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We have a case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Seizure that can't be explained by epilepsy. And accompanied by elevated calcium levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Still bored. Tell her why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because seizure with mildly elevated calcium is diagnostically simple. It's either hyper parathyroid, cancer or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well done. But until you can remember how to make coffee, hands off the patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House. All those reasons this case bores you, the ER has already ruled them out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Lungs are clear, get an EEG, confirm that brain functions are ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can we focus on the task at hand? Why did mommy twitch so hard she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You don't need me for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I need you, we're a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries in the brain cause seizures, inflamed arteries in the kidneys cause calcium build-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a moron; did you even look at the file? Kidney functions fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Whipple's. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Whipple's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Test her.  Cameron thinks it starts with a "w"; I'm thinking "v".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dad vomited this morning, maybe they've both got strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guy's poop chute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>V for vasoconstriction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gotta be my guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Excess calcium makes blood vessels in the brain clamp down, best case scenario, seizure; worst case, stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do a digital subtraction angiogram. Foreman can't tell up from down and Cameron's a girl - all that mechanical stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry, Cuddy says I'm stuck here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're late. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you are in my locked office. Again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What you got there? Special panties for your date with Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's not a date and it's none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not a date, it is business. And if it was business, you wouldn't say it was none of my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to talk about your date with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's not a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is fun. Spring Chase from NICU and I'll shut up about your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>NICU is short-staffed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you suddenly lost the ability to lie? Nobody's quit NICU in two years. And if you're making up reasons, that means there is no reason. Which means he asked for the assignment, didn't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If Chase needs a break from you, he should take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Both mom and dad are negative for strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You'll be back playing with the big toys soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or not. Either way I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don't have to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's ok. I can always work in a research lab or teach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And you'd be ok with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why wouldn't I be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were planning on pursuing grants of your own, running a department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm alive. Changing jobs, not making coffee... if that stuff bothers me now, I don't deserve this second chance.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They say that physical contact helps the healing process.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>What's happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your son's not getting enough oxygen,  take Mr Mason outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lung's collapsed, he's not getting any air, I need an IV catheter!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Another seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Her chest muscles aren't contracting, it's something else. Her whole back is spasming, two milligrams of diazepam, stat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>He's ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His lung wouldn't have collapsed if he was ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What the hell is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what causes seizures, hypercalcemia and the thing where mommy bends like Gumby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A little busy here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh oh, baby's lungs are going to conk out any minute. Probably want to deal with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll get right on it as soon as I finish indulging my boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Multi-task.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Chemical pneumonitis. Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs when he was underwater. Start him on prednisone; keep him on high FIO2 .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let the indulging commence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lithium could cause all 3 of the mother's symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No record she's on lithium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And tox screen was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lithium doesn't show on a basic tox screen, scarecrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Myelogenous meningitis could also cover everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rare complications of a rare blood cancer. You're not totally hopeless. Get an S-pep and an MRI for the myelogenous meningitis . Search the patient's place for lithium . Baby's lung problem is bacterial, not chemical, start ECMO . While you're searching for the lithium, take a water sample and check the pipes. You want me to write this down for you?  I ask you, is almost dying, any excuse for not being fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not putting that baby on ECMO, the chance of there being bacteria in bathwater--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't you want to work for me? I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not working NICU because of you. The baby's x-ray suggests a chemical pneumonitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to me. X-ray was too consolidated. So why are you down here? Hoping to expand your make out pool to include the preme to nine-year-old demographic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I needed a break. From the patients. They lie to us all the time, Foreman almost died trying to save a drug-dealing cop. I just wanted to get away from that for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What a complete load of crap. What am I a nurse you're trying to prep with this vulnerability thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>ECMO could kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't start him on ECMO and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship. But you do it your way. Nothing more honest than a dead baby </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>ECMO stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; basically we remove your son's blood--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>All of his blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We run it through a machine which takes out carbon dioxide and adds oxygen. Then we re-warm the blood and run it back into his body. There is a significant risk of internal haemorrhaging and he may also suffer from--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You put him on antibiotics; won't that take care of the infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not fast enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>Are you sure this is Mikey's best shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy's trash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not anymore. Paid good money for it.  Look at what she bought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Red clover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What is red clover used for, Dr Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Also used to treat asthma, psoriasis, joint pain...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She doesn't wheeze, flake or ache. And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner. She invited an oncologist. It's not a date, it's a consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mom's MRI was negative for masses, abscesses, there's no sign that she has myelogenous meningitis--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fascinating, call me when we have--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She has a subarachnoid bleed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So why is our patient bleeding into her brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her blood workup shows her ProTime's elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's bleeding because she's not clotting. So why is she not clotting?  What'd you bring us, daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The only mood altering drug was vodka, at the back of her drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hiding booze is classic alcoholic behaviour, that'd explain the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What bleeding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't remember? She bled all over you this morning . Kidding. Idiots are fun; no wonder every village wants one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If she's an alcoholic, she would also be more prone to hypercalcemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But tox screen was negative for alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, it was your idea. Now it's even better. Mommy quits, she gets the DTs, it even explains the seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Also fits conversion disorder. They're deep in debt, he's working round the clock, they got a new baby - I think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To put her in a phenocoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if I'm wrong? What if daddy's the drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you want us to give her the pheno or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want him to argue his point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I assume you considered the father and ruled him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's that saying where you ASSume you become a pain in the ass to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why should I argue? You'd just overrule me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need him to react; I need him to act like a human being. I need him to get over this boring, near-death rebirth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I have changed. It's not something you get over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nearly dying changes everything forever. For about 2 months. 2 months is too long, I need the guy I hired back now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No matter how much your misery loves company, it's not getting mine. I'll talk to the dad, Cameron can take the mom, we'll figure out if mom was a drinker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Waste of time; put her in a coma before the DTs kill her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So... is this a separation or...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Our lawyers have been hired, friends divvied up. Oddly she didn't fight me for House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> At least there aren't kids involved. Just have each other to deal with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm. If there had been kids, maybe we would have done more of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you want kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Listen, is there anything in particular you wanted to... hospital business or...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Catching up. I mean, you know... it's not like either one of us has anybody to run home to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's somebody here to see you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>Hey Mikey, mommy's awake. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>Oh Mikey, oh gosh, I was so scared! Oh... I love you  I love you so much, shh...  I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You don't have anything to be sorry about. You were sick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Turns out she and her husband met in AA, obviously she slipped. Good call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wasn't hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory.  Which was not stupid. I'm telling you, I'm going to drop the "N" bomb if I have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You're addicted to conflict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did they change the name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You could have handled this patient without dragging Chase in but the fact that he didn't want in killed you.  Just like the fact that you can't get a rise out of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where's the baby? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No breath sounds, crash cart and epi, stat!  I told you your psych theory wasn't stupid.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her child? Lucky break for the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid, the internal conflict triggers a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what else might be a trigger? A physical illness. It's a wild idea, I know especially since she doesn't have any obviously physical symptoms like internal bleeding or excess calcium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll draw some blood, test for--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ahhhh!! Jesus! You've done it again! Will you argue with me?! Drinkers don't eat right, explains the bleeding and the calcium, this might just be some crazy drunk and I'm telling you that she's about to die of myelogenous meningitis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly! It's an insane idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ok. What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have an original thought. In the meantime, stress her into having another seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can't, she's on Haloperidol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical, therefore, if you get caught, pretend you can't make coffee, mental defectives get tons of slack.  Take her off the Haloperidol, hook her up to an EEG, flash some lights, make her pant, shoot her up with a placebo. When she starts twitching, if the machine twitches along its real. If not, call the cops because she's a psycho killer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then you're pathetic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right now I'm annoyed! Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab is not the way to advance his recovery, it's too much!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Woah!  I didn't say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's annoying. Insisting every day of your life is a blessing is basically calling everyone else shallow. Gets old.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just admit that you like her. She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod. I think it's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Brent</speaker><content>You're not using my son's body to help her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ok. How about trading him for a beer? Or maybe you're more of a whiskey guy. You didn't have strep or stomach bug the morning you came in, you puked because you were hung over. If she was a recovering drunk and slipping most of the time, you'd be right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone without first being crazy enough for someone to notice. How many times did you go out for a drink because she was crying? How many times did you stay at work because you couldn't listen to her telling you what a bad mother she is? You were relieved. When she shut down. She just sat staring for hours at a time. She held the pillow over his head; you slept while she went nuts. Not exactly a draw but--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The baby didn't have colic he had celiac disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just like mom. Celiac can be triggered by all kinds of stress. Bills, childbirth, drunk husband. Every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread a slosh of soya sauce, her small intestine became more damaged,  less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals in her bloodstream. Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin, caused the pellagra. Didn't absorb vitamin K, caused the bleeding. And celiac is why the baby's meds didn't work. His body just couldn't absorb them. Switch mom to IV nutrition, its gluten free, that'll spruce her villi right up.</content></utterance>

About three days later, you break your ban on sugar and chow down a bucket of frozen yoghurt in the cafeteria, sprinkles included. Based on the last yoghurt sighting, you've got another week before you ovulate. You're on fertility meds. With red clover as an herbal booster.  And the dinner with Wilson was an audition.

Hmm. Kinda hard to sell when you don't believe it huh? And you never believed it. You just wanted all that crap you went through to mean something, well it didn't mean anything, it never does. Welcome back.</content></utterance>

We'd all slowly starve to death in our own filth, but at least we'd be happy. Listen, I need your self-worth to hang on this job. I need you kicking ass here to be all that lets you rise above being miserable, if waking up in the morning is enough, I don't need you.</content></utterance>
