<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>There's a new girl at the ice-cream store. She doesn't seem too fond of buttoning her top button. Let's go check her out.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>What are we supposed to be doing? It's almost four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Tchah! You got someplace to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>TWIN 15B</speaker><content>We know he likes to manipulate people. He's probably testing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>To find out what? How long we can look stupid for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>He said he'd be here by three; he's obviously not coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>I'm going home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Nobody follow her. She Pied-Piper'ed nine people right out of a job last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Would you mind holding my metaphor for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>New patient. Thirty-seven-year-old male, suffers from severe ascending muscle weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content> Why are you late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>To see who'd put up with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>So, you mean if we'd left, we'd have been fired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, I was going to fire everyone who stuck around. But since everyone stuck around....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Twenty-eight percent curvature of the spine has caused reduced lung capacity, and he has reduced bone mineral density.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Patient has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It's genetic. Incurable. This is not a diagnostic mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You have just given state secrets to the enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> What enemy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> New patient. New rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Today you're going to split yourselves into two teams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The first to figure out what's threatening to deprive the patient of the twenty or so miserable years he's got left with SMA gets to keep their jobs.  Take off your numbers. You look stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And I think I know who you are by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Wait. How do you want us to split up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good question, Overly Excited Former Foster Kid. There's ten of you. I was thinking... six against six? No, wait...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>TWIN 15B</speaker><content>How about Women versus Men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin. More interesting than Evens versus Odds, less interesting than Shirts against Skins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> If your sex organs dangle, you're the Confederates. If your sex organs are aesthetically pleasing, you're the Yanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>I'd like to be on the men's team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Do your sex organs dangle,  Cutthroat Bitch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>You've never hired more than one female on your team before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>If you're going to purge an entire gender, it isn't going to be the danglers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sounds logical.  If you don't think about it for more than three seconds. But I just told you that if the danglers lose, they're out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, I can only assume you're hiding the real reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You don't think the women will be aggressive enough, will be good enough at science. They'll be too emotional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> Can I switch teams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> If the danglers are okay, I'm okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>DOBSON</speaker><content>We're not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>I get it. You don't like me because maybe I'm a little bit... competitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Manipulative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Cutthroat Bitch is your official title.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>It's a game. You can either play for fun or play to win. If you want to win, you want cutthroat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>First thing we have to do is get inside his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>It's not psychological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Not talking about the patient. Talking about House. He's insane, but he's not irresponsible. He wouldn't be playing this game if he didn't already know the answer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>First thing we do is gang-bang the sucker. There's five of us. We can run dozens of tests. We don't need a theory; we just need brute force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>TWIN 15B</speaker><content>What about the assist dog? Picks bacteria-infested things up with its bacteria-infested mouth, hands them over to the guy and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>It's not the dog. Wouldn't be fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>TWIN 15A</speaker><content>To who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>Whom.  The men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>House knows I used to be a vet. If the dog's the answer, they'd be at a handicap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>What about the dog? Assist dogs put everything in their mouths...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>...money, doorknobs....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>That's not what I said. Why'd you think of low sodium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Patient took a trip to Thailand two weeks ago.  Hey, write bigger and angle the board more so they can see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>This is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>It's only wrong if they cheat off us, and if they cheat off us, they're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>DOBSON</speaker><content>They're not cheating. One of them is moving....</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Hey! Stop playing with your sutures or I'll have to redo them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Why do you guys keep a 'D' cell battery in a urine specimen cup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Because we pulled it from a patient's intestine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Why would somebody swallow a battery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Why do you assume it was swallowed?  Bed 5 needs a bag of Ringer's Lactate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Would have been worse if he'd used a 9-volt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Who said it was a 'he'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>False assumptions. You're good. You're trying to get me to think like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>And you're trying to kiss my ass.  Why are you talking to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> Because House is turning patient care into a game. It's dangerous. The patient's going to suffer - maybe die.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wow! You really need a shave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You see what I did there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>When a person faints, it's because they're not getting enough blood to their brain. The act of falling corrects the problem. You faint again strapped into that power chair where you can't fall, you might not wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Killed by an assistive device. At least my death would be ironic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I think when you went to Thailand you picked up a threadworm called Strongyloides. They usually go up through your feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>I didn't do a lot of walking on the beach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>But I assume you did have someone lay you down in the sand. Bare back, bare legs - increases exposure tenfold over bare feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Two pills. You'll be all better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Can I have some water for those, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Hey! Take a number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>House didn't say anything about taking turns. What's she testing you for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Don't.  They'll spend all day obsessing over my idea instead of coming up with one of their own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>But hey, I might be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Seriously. I'm worried that if we don't know what she's given you, there could be conflicts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>No, you're not. House told me. He's keeping track of all that. Ten doctors. I should be getting ten cures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>We need blood, hair, and stool. You poop, and then you use the wooden sticks to collect the fecal matter and you rub it on the green box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Why don't you hand it to my dog? Only one of us thinks I can do it on my own, and the last couple of days, I haven't even been doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>Is it all right with you if we carry you into the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>If you want me there, that's the way you're going to have to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Can I get a little head support please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>My offices are being used by my teams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Teams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Which means this is the only place where you can yell at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You have team-s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Two of them. I wanted to deal with the yelling today because I noticed what you were wearing and I wouldn't have to listen all that closely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You can't make a competition out of patient care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Without competition, we'd still be single-celled organisms.  Can I go now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Not until after the yelling.  What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I have seven of the finest minds on it, along with three very special...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You wouldn’t be doing this unless you already knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ah. I tell you; you tell them; game's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>If you know, you are OBLIGATED to treat...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, then, in that case... I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why would a guy voluntarily shove a metal object into an electrical socket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> I'm getting closer and closer to knowing the answer. What would happen if I shut down this game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'd fire them all, hire forty new fellowship applicants, start the game all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You DO know what's wrong with him, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It'd be pretty irresponsible if I didn't, wouldn't it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>FEMALE FELLOW</speaker><content>She likes bodysurfing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>HANDSOME FELLOW</speaker><content>Maybe picked up a virus swimming off Johns Beach.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> You don't stop a daily ritual that cures boredom because you're bored. She stopped doing her crossword puzzle because she's having a hard time reading it. What causes fever, boggy lungs, and blurry vision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>HANDSOME FELLOW</speaker><content> Fungal. Aspergillus would explain the pneumonia, which explains the fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Start her on amphotericin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Hey, guys! Great job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> ...bury yourself alive in Cuddy's cleavage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Teamwork. Collaboration. All for the greater good....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It could have been a suicidal gesture, as opposed to an actual attempt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Interestingly, the rain in Spain doesn't actually fall in the plain all that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Who puts their internal organs on a skillet just to get attention?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>How do we know you're not a double agent? Find out what we're thinking, then go back to the women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Because I don't care what you're thinking. You want to know why I want to be on your team? Because you're idiots. If I can get the women out of the competition, I'm in.  And so are two of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>So. What's the big move?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>It's called xenodiagnosis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>STARK</speaker><content>Why can't you test my feces?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Because you've been chugging milk of magnesia for the past hour. You got a lot going in and nothing coming out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Testing the bugs' feces is actually more accurate than testing yours. Smaller haystack, easier to find the needle.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>The test isn't done.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why would I call you that if you weren't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>It's an unusual combination. Unusual equals exotic, equals foreign. Has to be connected to his trip to Thailand.</content></utterance>

But... he has not regained consciousness.  So...  since I have you all here, we should probably talk about your ACTUAL patient.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>No. But he doesn't have cancer. We think it might be eosinophilic pneumonia.  Maybe you didn't want to die, but you didn't care if you lived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You insisted that I needed to see for myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> What, was he discharged?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He... died almost an hour ago. Apparently, it's bad to electrocute yourself within days of suffering massive internal injuries. Why did you need to talk to him? Did you... see... something?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If it's aggressive enough, it might have gotten past the steroids. Start him on cyclophosphamide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I already did.  Just looking at you hurts.  I'm going to order up some extra pain meds.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Why'd you call me?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You always had that phone in your hand.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>No. We were defeated. It's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>Patient presented with syncope. We thought it was threadworms, gave him ivermectin.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What's wrong with the dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>He's dead. There are only a handful of viruses that can cross between dogs and humans, but they may not be connected at all. The dog was old. I've seen it before. They hang on way past their normal life expectancy to take care of their masters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Did you watch him take the pills?  The ivermectin. Did you watch the patient put them in his mouth and swallow them?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What kind of dog is that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>JODY</speaker><content>They don't. I mean, it's used to treat heartworms in most dogs, but it'd be fatal if the...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Look familiar? I think the last time you saw it, it didn't have that dead dog's teethmarks on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-23"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I just put it on the bed tray to get him some water.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>SCHAFFER</speaker><content>No, you weren't. You couldn't be. There's a reason we have rules. If every doctor did whatever his 'gut' told him was right, we'd have a lot more dead bodies to deal with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It won't happen again.</content></utterance>
