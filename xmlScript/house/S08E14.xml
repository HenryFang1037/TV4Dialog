<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid's a blind diabetic. He's hyperglycemic hyperosmolar.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Which is what we thought until his blood tests showed a controlled sugar level and no ketones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It could be caused by drug abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His tox screens were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You lying sack of crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I have them right in front of me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not you. This time. My former BFF.  He's S-M-I-T-B-A-W-S. Stabbing me in the back as we speak.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Where exactly are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If anyone should happen to ask, I'm in an out-of-state medical conference until further notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Why would any—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And… don't really care. Auditory hallucinations and disorientation could be signs of schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They did a psych consult. Mental status is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Seizure, noise-induced epilepsy — the sound of rush hour traffic could have set it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run an E.E.G. Blast his brain with harmonics to find out. Also, if anyone should further happen to ask, I spent the whole last year in Africa with Doctors Without Boundaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Who are you hiding from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Evil. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, he's at an out-of-state medical conference. In Baltimore, I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Nice to meet you. I'm Blythe, his mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Do you want me to pick up the Braille writer and laptop from your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I don't plan on being here that long. I didn't eat lunch yesterday. I probably just fainted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Or had an epileptic seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Which is only one possibility. I'm Doctor Chase. Uh, we'd like to discuss your case with you privately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>I'm his girlfriend. Is it all right if I stay for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Melissa can stay. And I've never had a seizure before in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They can be mild. Like a loss of concentration or a muscle tremor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>A lot of times a family member notices before the patient does. I'm Doctor Park, by the way. I'm 5'2", Asian, and I'm totally cool with it if you wanna feel my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Blind people only do that in movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>But you sound nice, so if you want me to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her point was, you may not have realized you were having a seizure, but maybe your girlfriend has?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>No. But I-I haven't seen him for the last five months. We were on a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Like Rachel and Ross on Friends. Never seen the show myself, but I hear it's good. That joke usually kills my blind friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Will, this is serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>No, it's not. Since I don't have epilepsy.  I have to pay attention to every signal my body sends or receives. Or I end up taking a dirt nap. You don't think I'd know if I was having seizures? It's probably just low blood sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If that's true, then you shouldn't have a problem passing our test.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>How is he, James, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's better than I've seen him in a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Is he happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>It's okay. He's always been a complicated child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Were you in the hospital recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Oh, nothing serious. I just had a few moles removed yesterday and forgot I even had it on.  Look, if Greg happens to get back early from the conference, I'm staying at a hotel in town for the next three days.  I would like him to call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I will pass it on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Thank you. Um, do you think that they would mind if I got a refill for the road? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Not seeing any seizure activity in response to low frequency sounds. I'm starting him on mid-range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Have you seen his girlfriend? Extremely hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Blind people can't have attractive girlfriends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not my point. He actually convinced her to go for the whole relationship break thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How do you know it wasn't her idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Because she's back with him. Women suggest a break when they wanna break up. Men do it because they wanna have sex with other women before they settle down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>They're a little young to get married, don't you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was their age when I did.  I see your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He's seizing. Sound frequency's at 300 hertz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not a seizure. He's not spiking on his E.E.G.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's not moving air. I think he's choking on something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Blood. I don't see any blockage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Help me move him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Just relax and breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>What-what are these?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Three teeth detached from his jawbone and lodged in his throat. He almost choked to death on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Environmental? Could be heavy metal poisoning or radiation exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Then he wouldn't be the only one. He's an accountant who works on the same floor with 50 other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Maybe his girlfriend poisoned him.  House usually thinks that's a good guess. And she's gotta be pissed off and have low self-esteem. Why else would she give him a free pass to pork other women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Because he's handicapped. Women feel sorry for us. This cane is tail bait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Where are you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Expect an actual answer this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> Hi, guys. Was wondering if House's mother left yet. He won't let me go to our hous—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's not environmental, it's periodontitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>An oral infection doesn't explain his disorientation and auditory hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They're laughing because they know diabetes exacerbates the condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It could progress to a systemic disease. The bacteria spread and affect other organs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Like his brain. Start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics and book him an appointment with a periodontist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He has fake children now, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>You think I'm not good enough for your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not in front of the kids, honey.  Hey, add a couple of flies, toss in a dead goat or two, we might have a winner.  She gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. We really need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.  Crayons down. Line up if you wanna get paid.   It's the only time I ever successfully lie to my mom; is through the elaborate preparations and props.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey. I said no Transformers, Slick.   Stay here until the coast is clear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You sleeping with her now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just in case an I.N.S. guy comes in through the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, she didn't buy it either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You need to talk to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When I'm ready. Still need to get a fake passport, doctored photos, maybe a case of AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's sick, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did she say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She was wearing a hospital admission bracelet and carrying around a book on dealing with terminal cancer.  I'm sorry.  She's staying at the Grand for the next three days.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>The antibiotics will stop the infection from spreading further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And I'll spare you the lecture you'll get from the periodontist tomorrow, but you need to practice better oral hygiene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>So are you guys saying this is happening because, what, I didn't floss enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Probably didn't help, but diabetics are prone to this type of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content> Half the time, he doesn't even bother getting undressed before he goes to bed. Can only imagine how many times you've skipped brushing your teeth since we— Sorry. I don't mean to lecture you, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Well, I guess you're right. Look, you haven't eaten anything all day. Why don't you go grab a bite? I'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>All right, well, I'll see you in an hour, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Not if I see you first.  I was wondering if I could ask you guys for a favor. I really need my laptop and Braille writer, and I can't ask Melissa to get them for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Because…  I want you to put this someplace safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>People always say diamonds are beautiful. But to me they just feel cold. They have really sharp edges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I guess convincing her to take a break was a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Well, the break was her idea. Melissa's the only girl I've ever dated. She wanted me to be sure before we… took the next step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're here. We might as well search the place in case we're wrong about periodontitis.  What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We're here. Might as well eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're stealing food from a blind man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>We're doing him a favor. He owes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I take it from your low self-esteem theory you have some experience with relationship breaks?  What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He talked me into it, then… slept with three of my friends. Then dumped my ass. College boyfriend. Thought he was the love of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Then why agree to a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>My self-esteem wasn't as high back then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No one's is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Ugh!  Sugar free!  Ugh. Disgusting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll check the bathroom. You keep checking the snacks,</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry I didn't call first. I just flew back from my conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Um, this—this really isn't, uh—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need your medical records and the name of your primary physician.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Well, you remember Mr. Bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if I didn't, I will now.  You're not dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>I, uh… I may have misled James by letting him see a book on cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>[We did, however, have some expectations that you might call first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Yeah. This isn't how I envisioned you finding out. Mr. Bell and I, we're…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Having sex. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Getting married. Also.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>We wanted you to be the first to know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I need 10 milligrams of benzodiazepine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Help me hold him down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'm putting epilepsy back on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And I'm taking it off because it doesn't explain losing his teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The kid's diabetic. The periodontitis could be real but completely unrelated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Coincidence. Buying that, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Until I hear something that takes my mind off the Jurassic schlong that I was traumatized by this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I know what's wrong with the patient. Illegal drugs. Some kind of acid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His tox screens were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>His apartment wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> We didn't find any drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Then why am I completely tripping balls right now? I'm seriously freaking out here, guys. Can't you tell? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You pretty much look the same as you always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take your glasses off. Pupils dilated… Pulse elevated. Hallucinating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I think so, because… he's a rabbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. Because she's his wife.  They flirt a lot. I've seen things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Mm, Taub— Taub is either… a tooth fairy or… Rainbow Brite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>And you…  you're just House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She ate ice cream and Gummi Bears at the patient's apartment. One of 'em must have been dosed with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go back and find the drugs. You two, find out where he bought them, and then MRI his brain. Check for infections, masses, and plaques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Am I gonna die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We'll get back to you on that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I've been blind since birth. I thought maybe if I tried LSD, I might, you know… Colors… a shape. I just-I just wanted to see something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How many times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Maybe five or six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to know where you bought it so we can find out what was in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>My girlfriend gave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'll find her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>No, don't. It-it wasn't Melissa. I met someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>When were you planning on telling her that, before or after you ask her to marry you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>The ring isn't for her. We were on a break. She wanted me to see what else was out there, and I did. I was gonna tell her the other night, but I ended up here instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We just need to talk to the one who supplied the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>She's on vacation with her parents. This is her cell.  I don't want her to know I'm in the hospital. She'll only freak out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> That's very considerate of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>You think this is easy for me. I know I have to tell Melissa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Well, what's stopping you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>She's still one of my best friends. And I don't want to be alone in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Have you seen your mother yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She's not dying. She was having sex with my father.  Ignore her. She's on acid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your father's dead, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the dead dad, the biological dad. The one I pointed out to you at fake father's funeral. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. Are you sure? Your only evidence is that birthmark you saw when you were 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, now I've seen two. Good news is, I won't technically be a bastard much longer. We're gonna be one big, crappy family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, that's-that's great news. Your mother won't be alone anymore, and you can finally get to know the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, that is one option. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you saying you're not even curious? You want to know what I think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you know the answer to that question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You avoid your mother because she's the one person whose opinion you actually care about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If that was true, you'd have every reason to shut up. I avoid my mother because she's boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's why you've been so open and honest about prison and marrying a complete stranger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even if I care what she thinks, why would I care what some sperm donor does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You read the guy's book about three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Years ago. It took three times because it was so badly written.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Oh, I get it. The second birthmark was on his penis, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He's a dick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You've been working for House for months and just now realized that disabled people can also be dicks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What he's doing now to that girl isn't fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The break was her idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And now she thinks they're back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's a scared, sick, blind kid who doesn't want to be alone. You really don't get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I do, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Not good news for him… or Park.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Where's Park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson's babysitting her. Talking about the fact that she could have permanent brain damage might bum her trip out a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A dark spot doesn't necessarily equal brain damage. It could be a congenital malformation connected with his blindness or a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Exactly. We need to do another scan, but inject dye and figure out—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said "a clot," not "or a clot." It's a clot. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Good news for Park. I've never seen one present this large before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It fits. When it was smaller, it caused his initial disorientation and hallucinations. As it grew larger, the seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If left untreated, it leads to cerebral edema and death. But what causes that and tooth loss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Any hyper-coagulable state. Lupus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I counter your lupus with Behcet's syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, he doesn't have any of the earlier symptoms — color blindness, abnormal visual fields or— We've been ignoring his eyes because he's blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if he wasn't before, he would be by now. Confirm with an eye exam, start treatment with heparin for the clot. Interferon and steroids for the Behcet's.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Give me back my teeth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Park, listen. Park—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You're a tooth thief!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, no, no. Stop it, stop it! Ki-ki-ki! Back on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>What are you doing to this poor girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not what it looks like. She— Oh!  She's tripping on acid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Good lord, man, that's no way to treat a bad trip. Put the chair down. You'll end up hurting the poor wee thing. There you are.  Hello, darlin'. I'm Thomas, and this beautiful creature here is Blythe. Is there anything we can do to help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> That rabbit stole my teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Of course he did, but I'll tell you what he's done. He's put them back again, and they're twice as nice as they used to be. You can feel them if you like.  See? Now, why don't we sit on this nice comfy couch, have a nice cool drink and talk all about it. Would you like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content> He's had some experience with things like this, back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>As I recall, both of us—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Uh, not the time or the place, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>There you are. See? There you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's no way that guy's related to you. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's fresh scarring and swelling in both fundi, and a bleed on the left. House was right. It's Behcet's syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Give it to me straight, Doc. Am I ever gonna see again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's a little out of our jurisdiction. We need to wrap a dressing over your eyes to keep the light out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>It’s not really a problem for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You might not see it, but your tissue does. It'll also help with the swelling. I'll leave you in Dr. Adams' capable hands. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>You think I'm an ass, don't you? I can tell by your breathing. Either you're angry or fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> I think it's unfair that you're leading on a woman who obviously loves and cares about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I love and care about her too. But we just don't work together as a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You need to tell her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I'm going to. But I just want to do it the right way. I don't want her to hate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>When she finds out you bought an engagement ring for another woman, that option is out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>It was gonna be for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>She told me we were going on a break. I didn't even get a say in the matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>She wanted you to be sure about your relationship. I can see how that would be annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I think I liked it better when you were just breathing angrily. She still sees me as the same sheltered, blind geek she met in college. Most of the time she acts more like my mother than my girlfriend. I asked her to marry me. She tells me I need to date somebody else first. I'd rather she just dumped me. At least that I can understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>So you were hurt so much you had to marry the next woman you met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Julie doesn't see me as I was, but for who I am now. She trusts me to make my own decisions and to help her with hers. For the first time in my life, I have somebody who needs me… instead of the other way around.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Ah, she finally fell asleep. I think she'll be fine in a couple of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you know about handling a bad acid trip? Friends in your gardening club been experimenting again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>I was young once.  A little scrapbook that Thomas threw together. He even has a couple of pictures of you as a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>And I've known Greg almost since he was born, you know. His father and I were like brothers. I was a Navy chaplain in those days. I left the service in the late '60s. I don't think his dad ever forgave me for protesting the war.  Of course, if he knew I'd got Blythe involved…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You protested the war? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>You were a child. I didn't share my entire schedule with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Well we knew if we told you, you'd tell him, and he'd kill us both. He was a marine. It was the ultimate betrayal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Penultimate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>Sweetheart, I think we need to get back to the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Wilson, it's been a real pleasure.  You're right. Much too formal. Come here, lad.  We're practically family now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>We'll see you boys tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>8:00 sharp.  I invited them out to dinner. Told them it was your idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Straw. I know we agreed that whatever happened on break would stay on break, and I don't expect you to talk about yours. But I just want you to know that there was no one else.  I missed you so much, I barely even saw my own friends. I'm just so glad it's finally over.  Are you okay?  What's happening to him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Is he going to be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm going to need to discuss that with my colleagues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>We have to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>No, you need to rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I have to tell you about… about what happened on break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Later. You just lie back and relax—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Stop it, Melissa! Just stop telling me what I need, and listen for once, okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Embarrassed. I'm still not sure what was real or what I hallucinated. Did you try to kiss me?  What about you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's stabilized for the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Coughing up blood. That doesn't really change anything. Hemoptysis is a symptom of Behcet's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Except our treatment should make him better, not worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It could be doing both. Our treatment breaks down his clot in his head, like it's supposed to, except a piece broke off and traveled to one of his arteries in his lungs. If anything, we need to increase the heparin to prevent further clots from forming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>If we do that and he starts hemorrhaging, we won't be able to stop the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we don't do that, the next clot could cause a heart attack or a stroke. Park's way, he at least has a shot at living. CT his lungs to confirm, and up the dose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's young and hot. She'll bounce back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Eighty-two pounds.  How much weight I put on when my break ended the same way. People were calling me Park-ing-lot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Hmm… Almost 9:00. I think your boy is gonna stand us up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>No, no, he'll be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Practically walked in on us having sex. God, if I saw my mother doing that, I'd claw my own eyes out. Of course, she was nowhere near as attractive as you. Horribly fat, as a matter of fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mother… Guy sleeping with my mother, this is Dominika, my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>It's so nice to be meeting you. And Gregory tells me that you were born in Richmond, Virginia, and your father was a tailor who stole from his clients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>James has persuaded me of the value of openness and honesty in relationships.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We see people with disabilities all the time, but… seeing and understanding aren't always the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Are you talking to me or writing a Facebook post?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'm saying we should have picked up on the degeneration in his eyes sooner. We ignored them because we assumed they weren't even part of the equation. I also realized, intellectually, I may understand what it means to be disabled, but emotionally, I didn't have a clue. Apparently, his girlfriend didn't either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So you're back on his side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's not a side. It's a perspective. He just wants to be treated like an adult, make his own decisions. I may not agree with all of them, but how the hell can I judge him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm sure that's exactly what disabled people want, to be treated like completely foreign entities, incapable of being judged and understood.  Park was right about the clot. Hopefully the anticoagulants keep it from killing him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So… she gets the couch on the odd nights, and I get the bed on evens. In exchange for a federal felony, she gets a green card, and I get a live-in maid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Good for you. The immigration policy in this country is a travesty. It forces people to lie just so nice people can stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Thank you… Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm grateful you approve.  You should also know that I was not in Africa the last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content> You were in jail.  I've been reading the Princeton police blotter ever since you moved here.  And I'm afraid I haven't been truthful with you either. And I've wanted to tell you this for a very long time. Thomas and I… we got married two months after your father passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>You understand, we didn't want you to think we were disrespecting the memory of your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And… is there another secret that you want to share with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's nothing you think might be relevant to my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Like… what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know. Just off the top of my head, something like I DNA-tested my dad and found that he was not my biological father — you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content> That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People lie. Birthmarks don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content> Oh, my God! You told me he was a premie. This bloody lunatic is my son!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>He's not a lunatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>All those years you could have told me. I could have done things. That could have made a difference in the boy's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think we should all just calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Look at him sitting there — a pill-popping sociopath! If you wanted to screw up his life, you couldn't have done it better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's got you there, mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>Blythe</speaker><content>He's one of the most well-respected doctors in the world. He's saved more lives than you can count. Now, you apologize to him, or I swear, you will never see me again, Thomas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>I can't deal with this anymore. He's my son? I'm having a bloody breath of fresh air, that's what I'm doing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, who's for dessert?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Somebody help me! Uhh! Somebody—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Will? It's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase. We just need to know—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>My eyes! My eyes! It feels like it's on fire!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not Behcet's. It doesn't necrotize tissue like this. I think it's streptococcus pyogenes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Except we've already treated him with broad-spectrum antibiotics. It shouldn't be spreading. It should be dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just means it's drug-resistant. We need to remove what's left of his eyes before the gangrene sets in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's something that looks and acts like a bacteria but isn't one. Could be viral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, it couldn't. No evidence of viral markers in the necrotized tissue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me see that image you took last night of the clot in his lung.  That's not a piece of the clot from his brain. That's the point of infection. Mucormycosis. He breathed in the spores, it's been growing and spreading ever since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A fungal infection spreading this fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid's a diabetic. He already has a compromised immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He's right. This sample from his eyes is crawling with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treat with amphotericin B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We treated him with gentamicin when we thought it was bacterial, which means the dose of amphotericin B we'll need to cure him will probably leave him deaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, I stopped listening after you said "the dose we'll need to cure him."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>Blind and deaf? I'd rather be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I can live with that. You never did get my humor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>There's a chance your hearing won't be completely gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>How much of a chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>A small one. But a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>I'm-I'm refusing treatment. You don't know how hard things are already for me. I can't handle any more. I can't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Oh, hi. I'm here to apologize. I could have handled the news with more… aplomb? I have a son. That's great news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What else did she tell you to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>You're not a lunatic, you're not a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I never liked your friend… my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Well, he could be a bit intense at times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But unlike you, I did respect him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Thomas</speaker><content>Do you respect your mother?  Well, we do have that in common. And we all love her. So we don't have much choice, do we? Son, see you at dinner. </content></utterance>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Will, it's me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Will</speaker><content>It won't work.</content></utterance>
