<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Scout</speaker><content>I'm watching everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>You don't need to watch everybody. You need to watch 77.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Scout</speaker><content>You his agent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Just an objective mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Scout</speaker><content>His explosion is impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>It's not just burst. He can pull too. You know, the only reason he went to a Double A school, he was a bit of a late bloomer. He's a big man now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Scout</speaker><content>You should be his agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>Nice pancake, 7-7! You're moving up those draft boards!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Thank you, sir!</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Canoeing. But I seem to be taking on water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is not okay. Use your own bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No canoe in my bathroom.  My leg hurts. Soaking it makes it feel better. You were the one who had to have this condo. Maybe next time you should consider amenities, like two full baths, instead of just the joy of outbidding Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The guy who signs the loan gets to pick the bedrooms. Stay out of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well then, you owe me 35 bucks for the grab rail I installed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hit the kill screen. Boss is here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not porn. It's our new patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bummer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>22-year-old male – 6'7", 310 pounds. Clearly has brain involvement.  The guy has no recollection of this entire incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Football player. Those are the ones that get hit in the head a lot, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>ER CT'd him. No concussion, no stroke, no cortical degeneration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And he had a full psych evaluation. He's not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it's roid rage. You don't think they grow them that big naturally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ER also tested for steroids. He's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only proving that our guy got his hands on the good stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The negative test at least means steroids is less likely. We should discuss other possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? He injects his sore ankles with lidocaine every game. You think he's above injecting steroids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Repeated head trauma could damage the base of the brain, leading to a pituitary adenoma, which leaks GnRH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Pituitary damage wouldn't be visible on a CT scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could cause the excess hormones that could cause the rage and would elude the ER Steroid test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Bilateral venous sampling to find the elevated GnRH. MRI to find the pituitary damage.  Unless, of course, there is no pituitary damage, in which case, our guy got his hands on the good stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman. Let the peasants handle the peasantry. Your brother needs to get picked up this afternoon... from prison. Your older brother, in case your confusion is related –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How do you know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He left a message. Said he couldn't get you on your cell or at home. I get it. You're busy. You'll pick him up the next time he comes out of prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Is that all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're officially unbusy. Family is family. Take the rest of the day. Go see your brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I have work to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you feel any pain that's deep and persistent, not just muscles or joints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Everything hurts all the time. That's football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It might not be just football. We're gonna test for damage to your pituitary. If there is, it could create excess hormones, which could be causing your pain. It would also explain your rage attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>And if my pituitary is damaged, how long would it take to treat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start promising deadlines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>I-I'm sorry, doctor, but he's playing in front of pro scouts, coaches, and GMs this Saturday. This is the job interview for the rest of his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If we do find something wrong, we can go in through the nose and repair the damage – nothing too invasive. You'll need a couple days of recovery, and then we can have you back by game time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Thank you, doctor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's nothing wrong with your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>Well, then your gizmo's broken. I'm seeing spots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or you enlisted, you got the cool haircut and the awesome pants, then you realized that your plane ticket to the Middle East was coach, and you decided to rethink your promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>No. I've already been there – three deployments. Now they want me to go again. But my wife's pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So our homeland should be unsafe because your private was unsafe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>Look, my wife and I planned this perfect. My enlistment was supposed to be over last week, so we got pregnant six months ago. Now they tell me I'm getting stop-lossed – Army speak for they don't care about the fact that I've already finished my contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care about the fact that they don't care. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>Hey, come on. I waited an extra hour just to make sure I got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>I saw you limping out there. Vietnam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Viet?!? How old do you think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>I don't know, Vietnam age?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, back in my day, the real dodgers had the stones to run up to Canada or shoot themselves in the foot. They didn't come to free clinics whining for doctors' notes. Go hug your wife. Tell her to get a babysitter. You'll be back in time to video the kid's first steps.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't need to see the scan. I can tell from your little puppy-dog eyes that his pituitary's fine. Are you gonna say it, or should I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> You were right about the steroids. You're a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next time with feeling. Put the cheater on a somatostatin analog to clear it out of his system. Send him back to his football game.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>I've never done steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, somehow your GnRH got elevated. This will help get it back down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Mom, I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Who's gonna draft you, Daryl? You're stupid enough to try that stuff, especially the week you know you're getting tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>You guys must've mixed up your labs or got somebody else's blood, because I’ve never –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Okay, what is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tachycardia. Lay back down, Daryl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content> Why's my heart beating like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not steroids.  I need some adenosine! And get that crash cart over here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content> Oh. Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, next time – Marcus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, right. You two know each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Uh, interviewing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh! Who are we kidding? Interview's over. You got the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My new assistant. Part of his parole – he needs a job. Just trying to do my part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were wrong about the steroids. Patient had a paroxysmal tachycardia. We cardioverted him back to sinus rhythm. We're gonna get an EKG and a sestamibi scan. Marcus... let's talk outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Family is family. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Hey. Good to see you too. Did you have a hard stretch? No, not bad. I hardly got raped at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Well, your boss says I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not playing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Lighten up. Man, this could be fun. I get to see your world. You get me access to the pharmacy.  I am playing. Come on, man. You look good. I'd already know that if you came to visit every once in a while, but whatever, I get it. It–it's cool. You don't want to see me. You don't want to pick me up. It's all justified. I'll just have to win you back over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let me explain something. This man who's offering you the job – he's not a philanthropist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>He seems more helpful than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn't want to help you. He only wants to use you to screw with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>You know how you can screw with him? Act like your brother getting a job doesn't screw with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Trust me, it'll be better for both of us if you go back in there and tell him you can't take the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>I'm not a person who has the luxury of turning down jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, figure something out... 'cause you cannot work here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ho-wah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay. Oh! Oh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We spent all night, used all the fancy machines. Patient's heart looks fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if it was fine, it wouldn't go aflutter just 'cause you walked into the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Light whip, two extra shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.  Judging by the look on your face, I assume you're upset that big bro didn't take your advice and skip town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You told him about our conversation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content> He bought me breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was fun.  Put lunch in the books, just you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Our patient could have a PFO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, naturally, you jump right to a urinary issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>PFO's not urinary. It's a heart issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is? Hmm. Well, naturally, you think it's not a urinary issue, 'cause you're so embarrassed about your own past urinary issues, you don't dare broach the subject.  Oh, come on. You spending the night over at Bobby Samson's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I did not wet the bed. I spilled a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're not buying it, Eric. We never bought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why are you telling him these things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content> What's the big deal? It was 25 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix, the rough flow causes a clot, explains the heart and head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Like that power forward from Loyola Marymount, when he, um...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hank Gathers? That's not what happened to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let your brother speak. What happened to Hank Gathers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Conference tournament – Alley-oop dunk, jams it home. Then he runs up the court and splat. He dropped dead of a heart thing right there on the court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rage and tachycardia are warning signs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Seriously? Because my brother remembers a basketball game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, I don't care where an idea comes from, as long as it makes sense and embarrasses someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you out of your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As a former psychiatric patient, I take offense at that terminology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>All I did was ban you from my tub. Whatever happened to proportional response?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever happened to coherent conversation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That... thing... broke tiles, gashed the walls, and pooped everywhere. Expect a bill for repairs... And payback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea. Everybody else thinks hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes sense?  Good. Stick the patient on a treadmill. Stress his heart until it stops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You want to induce cardiac arrest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only real treatment is for the patient never to stress his heart again, which means we have to tell him to retire at the ripe old age of 21. Stopping his heart speaks louder than words. Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Maybe it's a good thing. He gave your brother a job, responsibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not arguing that he shouldn't have a job. I just don't want him having one here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I understand that House did this to annoy you. But why is he succeeding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> you know what my brother did the last time he got out of prison? He stole money from my parents to buy drugs. He robbed a liquor store. Then he moved on to jacking luxury cars –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Every time. I've known my brother for over 30 years. You haven't even known him a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The exterminator charged $250 to get the opossum out of there, and the contractor estimates $1,500 to fix the bathroom. And why are you jerking Foreman around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it's fun. Maybe you should give those bills to the guy who left his own bathroom window open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your motives always run deeper than simple fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to learn more about one of my employees so that I can manipulate him and destroy him if and when I choose. Information is power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not buying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Why don't you tell me my real evil plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't think there is an evil plan. You regret not having a relationship with your own family, and you don't want to see Foreman go down that same path. I think you're actually… being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, shut up. You can't accuse me of an opossum attack and underhanded kindness in the same visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then I'll come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Treadmill test was a bust. The guy's in unbelievable shape. We couldn't get his heart rate above 150.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Your boss is secretly a very nice man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we can't re-create the cardiac event, we can't prove hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either we find a bigger treadmill... or... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did I miss the memo about you being released?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>I'm feeling fine. I can't keep laying here in this bed missing practices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All excellent points. Give me your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>What's in the shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a vasodilator. Since we can't exercise your son's heart on the treadmill, I'm gonna have to do it chemically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're turning white.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means he doesn't need football to get a good job anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Arterial plaque throwing clots would explain the fingers, head, heart.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're kidding me. You got him a desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And a nameplate. Man's got to have a place he can call his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about Takayasu's arteritis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lymphoma's a better fit. We should remove his spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bold move to skip straight to surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His big game's coming up. We don't have time to biopsy, wait for the pathology report, and resect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. We should remove his spleen without confirmation so he won't miss the big game.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it's lymphoma, the ethanol will make him itchy, and Foreman can remove his spleen. If it's Takayasu's, he'll lose his radial pulse, and Chase can start him on steroids.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not an idiot. Don't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Come on, man. I'm a new person now – no more drugs, no more lying. And if I can't get my own family to give me an opportunity to prove that, then what's the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mom and Dad gave you a chance and a second and a third. I'm not about to give you a 54th.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's busy spying on his little brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's very demeaning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You obviously have a theory as to why demeaning is not demeaning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're escalating to prove I was wrong about you being nice, which you would only do if I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you even listen to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> 23-year-old just came into the E.R., asked for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's her cup size?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't think his cup size is relevant to his condition. He accidentally shot himself in the foot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh! Seriously? I give you a choice between moving to Canada and shooting yourself in the foot, and you chose the bullet?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think this is gonna get you discharged? We'll patch it up and send you right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>Don't patch it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look… You got screwed over by your own government, and that sucks. But all you're gonna get out of this is a five-day vacation and a band-aid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>When I signed up, I was just a guy. Now I'm about to be a dad. I go back over, there's a chance my kid grows up without a father.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We have to keep going until you start feeling something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Might help if, uh, you told me what I'm supposed to feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If I do that, that's all you'll be thinking about. Then you'll be telling me that's what you're feeling. Power of suggestion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>The other black dude who was in here earlier, he your brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What gave it away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>The way you looked at him. I have two older brothers, and we always want to kill each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Oh. Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Not really. It just feels itchy.  Is that what you're waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Means lymphoma's most likely, but that's actually good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>How could that be good news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because it's treatable. We can remove your spleen tonight laparoscopically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Will I be able to run by Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can get to the radiation in the off-season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content> Hey, Ma. Wake up, Ma. Wake up. I'm itchy. Means I can play.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh.  What are you doing in the dark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lying in wait. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Jeez. What happened to your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right... Play innocent. Like you weren't looking for revenge for the prank that I didn't pull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's karmic justice, but I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course you realize, this means war.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Isolating the gastroepiploic artery.  Nearly there.  Foreman, come and take a look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Liver's inflamed. So the itching wasn't caused by his spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not lymphoma.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What happened to your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No abnormal "T" cells or "B" cells. It's definitely not lymphoma. Liver biopsy only revealed nonspecific inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Kind of like the time you took your mom's birth control pills on a dare and ended up with swollen nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, and your nickname all the way up through high school wasn't Erica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Okay, I may have made that one up, with the understanding that my brother still had a sense of humor and would figure out to play along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Polymyositis would explain the head, liver, heart, even the white fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It would also be accompanied by a significant decrease in muscle power. Marcus! A chance to redeem yourself. Does our patient look strong to you?  Sorry, Eric. Big brother disagrees with your diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Felty syndrome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said the liver was inflamed, not the spleen. Can you believe they let this guy perform surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Requesting permission to share my idea without being belittled in front of your new assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Permission denied. Continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Our patient has cartilage damage in both ankles. He gets lidocaine shots before every game to mask the pain. Team doctor uses the same needle twice by accident, viral hepatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>D’you think he's an idiot, Marcus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>I don't think he's an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Go test his blood.  Come on. We have a lunch scheduled.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, you jerked me around. Your allegiance lies with your brother. I get it. Admirable. But here's the problem. I hired you to tell me the truth. If you don't do that, you no longer have a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>I don't know what secret you're looking to uncover, but my brother is a decent guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was arrested for grand theft auto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>You're gonna be disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>He tell you I was with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was it your idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>We did everything together. I don't know whose idea it was. I was 16. He was only 14. Little punk couldn't even see over the steering wheel. He's quicker with a flathead screwdriver than most people with a key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sorry to interrupt my character assassination with boring medical stuff, but when we drew the patient's blood, it clotted right there in the vacutainer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So the problem is not in his blood, it's the blood itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's been working out in the cold doing two-a-days. It's got to be cryoglobulinemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I usually love breaking bad news. But in this case... start the patient on warfarin.  I'm so sorry about that. You were saying...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>We drove for about ten minutes before we got caught, and that was it. When our mom came down to the station, she didn't say a word the whole ride home. She came up to the driveway, turned off the car. We're sitting in there in silence. Then without turning around, she said, "I'll pray for you." And she got out of the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wow. You got off easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Easy for you, easy for me, not easy for Eric. His life mission became to never disappoint our mother like that again, because he is a good guy. I thought he would tell that story at the eulogy. But I heard he didn't give one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Y–your mother's dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>If he didn't tell you, I'm sure he had a reason. Look, you can mock him all you want about peeing in the bed, but... please... don't bring up our mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your blood contains an abnormally high volume of certain proteins called cryoglobulins. They become thick when it gets cold outside. It's like a car trying to run after the oil's turned to sludge. We think that's what's been causing all your problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>So I just need a quick oil change and I'm good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This oil change isn't so quick. We have to put you on blood thinners and other medications. The process will take two to three weeks. But after that, you should be able to play without a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>After that, it's not gonna matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Doctor, if Daryl doesn't play in front of the scouts on Saturday, he won't get drafted. Can't you wait until after the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we wait and let him play, there's a good chance he dies right on the field.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had an epiphany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Usually that precedes you walking away with purpose, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Flathead screwdriver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And then I say...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not a game. It's proof that you didn't rig the grab rail and make me fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I already have proof of that – The fact that I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can't go on that. But I can go on the fact that I had to borrow a flathead screwdriver from Nora to install the thing, 'cause we only had a Phillips-head. And then, of course, I returned it late that night in a completely successful effort to see her braless...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Whoa. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means that you didn't have the tool to sabotage the grab rail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Braless under, like, a sweater or, like, a – like, a –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now I also have proof that I'm not responsible for the opossum, because I'm absolving you of responsibility instead of escalating, which you know is not my nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So someone is breaking into our place just to screw with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The opossum... was meant for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm so tired. It was exciting till about 2:00 A.M. Now it's just torture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you even go to college?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is the escalation, isn't it? Keeping me up all night, nothing happens, then you keep me up all night again tomorrow. This is your retaliation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You see, that's just illogical, 'cause I'm staying up too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe you napped all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave you empirical proof that I did not prank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. No, you did not. You created empirical proof that I didn't prank you, selling me on the notion that you didn't prank me. Maybe you self-pranked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't master-prank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is that cut on your cheek even real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, this is exactly what our nemesis wants – divide and conquer. Can't you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay. I'm going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm telling you, if you sleep now, you're gonna wake up next to severed horse heads. Or worse, the rest of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh! House!  The flat screen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ah. Ah.  You would never sacrifice the flat screen.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> is there a reason for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Zer is a reason for everything, mes amis. I am tro-bled to report that we have a criminal in our midst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Guilty of what exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Last night, the fire sprinklers flooded our apartment. And before that, I found an opossum in my bathtub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You each had motive. You each had opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is the emergency you paged me about? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not so fast, Mademoiselle Cuddy. No one leaves here until they can account for their whereabouts on the evening last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay, no one who is employed by me leaves here until they account for their whereabouts the evening last. What about you, Professor Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why would I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you hold me responsible for breaking up your marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was here all night with Thirteen, monitoring our patient's IV blood thinners. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can either of you prove that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The patient's alive and improving. Is that proof enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For now. What about you, Colonel Taub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was out to dinner with my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good enough.  'Cause I had you pegged all along. You certainly had all the motive in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>First of all, I'm not interested. Second, I don't even know where you guys live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yesterday I confirmed that you are a liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, I think you're getting off topic here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is he serious? Did your mom pass away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>About three months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-30"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why didn't you tell anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And to top it off, you refused to say anything nice about her at the funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I didn't talk because it isn't anyone's business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-33"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content> Stop. You don't have to explain yourself to this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want to hit me, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-35"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Marcus, don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-36"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>I quit. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>It means I am better. My coach had the team doctor come by. He cleared me to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Did your team doctor realize you're on blood thinners?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content> I'm off them now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're still sick. You're not ready to go off your meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Daryl, listen to him. It is not worth the risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>I'll come back on Sunday, Mom. You guys can give me all the meds I need then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The treatment doesn't work that way. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content> Outstanding, soldier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As a general rule, before you celebrate, do a little research. The army's medical evaluation board is perfectly fine with nine-toed infantrymen, as long as they can walk and run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>So I lost a toe for nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Hose</speaker><content>Afraid so. Unless you want me to keep you on the old antibiotics, let the infection spread, and we could amputate more than just a toe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why are you risking your life for this? Your mom doesn't want you to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>My mom sacrificed everything for me. Her telling me not to come here is just another example of that. I do good out there, I could take care of her for the rest of her life. Who am I if I don't sacrifice for her? That's family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Everything's blurry.  I can't see. Take me back to the hospital.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The blindness means we were wrong about his –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, I'm responsible for that.  Spiked his water bottle with nitrates, dropped his blood pressure, robbed oxygen-rich blood from his brain, making him blind. Figured a temporarily blind patient is better than a permanently dead one. Vision was already coming back by the time I dropped him off at the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well played. If only we could combine your medical chicanery with your brother's ability to fetch me mochas, you'd be the perfect Foreman. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm busy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Great. So we don't have a new symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Means we should just stick him back on his blood thinners, and he should be okay to leave in a couple weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, we do have a new symptom. Any of you take a look at his readmittance chart? Between the time he checked in and the time he rechecked in, our patient lost a single pound. Patient like that would usually shed over ten pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The obvious answer would be steroids, but since we've already ruled them out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So he's not injecting. But he could be getting them naturally – Paraneoplastic syndrome. The body produces antibodies, which battle cancer, which could also act like growth hormone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We've eliminated lymphoma. What other cancers mimic growth hormone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lung, pancreatic, renal, breast –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was a rhetorical question. I don't really care. Go test him for all of them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You need a job. Maybe I can talk to House, see if I can get your job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>Soon as he knows you're okay with me being there, he won't want me back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe I can help you figure out something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Marcus</speaker><content>I promise... I won't let you down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't do that. Let's just... See how it goes.  So, uh, do they mandate you to stay here at the halfway house? Or… can you come stay with family?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, it should stop now that Marcus left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that's the whole point –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. Was my leg sticking out? I'm so distracted lately, trying to think of something funnier than fire sprinklers going off in the middle of the night. Any ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Whoa, easy there, tiger. I know where you live. You know how I know?  'Cause my girlfriend and I – we tried to buy that very same condo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't you leave me out of this? Wilson was the one who bought the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>And you're living there. You... deserve to suffer equally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I suffered more now that you just tripped me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, hey, I-I-I'm –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>His suffering will equal out, 'cause he actually feels remorse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would you out yourself? You can't even imagine the retribution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> Oh, there won't be any. I am ceasing all offensive operations. I have both made my point and established my superiority. And if you even get to the planning stages of retaliation, I will tell Cuddy that she lost her dream place to you two. See, she's under this odd impression that you guys are her friends.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's no cancer. We scanned him head to toe. We checked blood smears for leukemia. We even ultrasounded his chest looking for breast cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe I was wrong about the weight loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You weren't wrong – we found blood in his catheter bag. His kidneys are failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So it has to be cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome is the only thing that can link kidney, heart, and liver – even the rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why can't we find it? We've looked everywhere inside this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if it's not inside?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know why you're black?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>'Cause God loves me more than he loves you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. What I was going for was melanin. You got lots of it.  It makes your skin dark, protects you from the sun's harmful UV rays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unfortunately, it also prevents even those with advanced medical degrees from considering melanoma as a diagnosis. Other hand.  On the rare occasion that black people do get skin cancer, they usually get it on the white parts – palms and soles of the feet.  But your hands and feet are so smashed up from football, my team are likely to have written off any skin blemish as a bruise. But now that I know that melanoma is the only thing that fits... Come take a look at this, Mom.  There's the thorn in the panther's paw. Paraneoplastic syndrome. Your body forms antibodies to fight the tumor.  Those tiny little proteins travel through your blood and wreak havoc. We remove the cancerous mole, everything should be fine. I'll tell Dr. Chase to schedule the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>Why bother? I missed my shot. What kind of life am I gonna lead now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you study really, really hard?  Then the same crappy life that the rest of the guys you'll be graduating with are gonna lead... minus the student loans.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Hey. You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Almost.  And… done.  I heard House and Wilson are getting pranked by someone. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why should I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>You said I had a trusting face. I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me retaliate, though. They stole your dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, that's overstating it. It's just a condo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>It's not because you feel guilty about hurting House or guilty for being with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We'll buy another one. I just don't see the need to make a war out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Well, I think you're rationalizing, which a less confident man than myself might take as a sign that you're second-guessing.  Okay, you know what? Forget that last part.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I heard Foreman and his brother are trying to work things out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's nice for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's nice of you. You didn't provoke Marcus to quit so the pranks would stop. You were becoming the common enemy they could bond over. You are the diabolical, yet benevolent puppet master.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I provoked Marcus to quit because he was no longer useful to me. I hired him to get information. I got information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh-huh. And how are we gonna get back at Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I win. </content></utterance>
