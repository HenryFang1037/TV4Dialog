<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I'll be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Food's gone, Daryl. We're closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>You wouldn't happen to have an extra coat in there, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>You're wearing a coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Daryl</speaker><content>A winter coat, man. It's cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Come on.  Here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Good night, Daryl.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You doing anything Friday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taking a lovely young lady to the Philharmonic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That your way of saying you're having sex with a hooker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two. Can't create a harmonic with just one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I was hoping you might be available for Rachel’s Simchat Bat. It's a…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Jewish baby-naming ceremony, a time-honored tradition dating all the way back to the 1960s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My house at 7:00. It'll just be the rabbi and a few friends and some family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing like welcoming a baby into the world with a completely naked display of hypocrisy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There'll be plenty of wine and nice people you can quietly mock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House… It's one evening. I'd like you to be there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just browsing. Thanks. Happy to be underachieving again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Running the ER is slacker heaven. Looking for anything in particular?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not anymore. Where's this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause he's my next patient. It'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's a drunk priest who hallucinated Jesus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Afraid you might have missed something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Afraid you're wasting everyone's time? It's obviously either alcohol or exhaustion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you admit you have no idea which?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I admit that I'm too busy to care who you're screwing with. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You went out of your way to pick him? This is nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be psychomotor epilepsy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be alcohol. Shouldn't we let the ER rule the obvious out —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You know something about this case you're not telling us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>'Cause you want to screw with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or screw with a hallucinating priest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Both are possible. There's only one day to find out. Run an EEG for epilepsy. CT his brain for tumors. And go check his House Of God for toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fourteen, hold up.  This department is broken,  and I'm not gonna take a real case until it's fixed. Job or relationship — your choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To put it in terms you might better understand, if you don't split, you must quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The drug trial is over. I’m out, she's out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're adults. We can handle this. You just have to give us a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you're not. No, you can’t. And no, I don’t. Mull it over. You got until the end of this fake case to decide.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I wasn't drunk. I had one or two drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>People often underestimate alcohol's effect on their —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I was on my way to six. I know how alcohol affects me. This wasn't the alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> You lived in Manhattan for three years. Then a year in Oregon, 18 months in New Mexico, less than a year in Wisconsin, and now you've been living in Trenton for the last six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The more we know about you, the more likely it is we can help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Mm, it's not medically relevant, so —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No way to know unless you went to medical school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Four years ago, a teen in a youth group at my church accused me of inappropriate contact. I was innocent, but the church decided to transfer me, said it would be easier for all involved. When the parishioners at the new church got wind of why I'd been transferred, they were unhappy. I was sent off again and again, and how is any of that medically relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So the kid lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>He was confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Confused whether you molested him or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Okay, you wanted to know why I moved around so much, and I told you. How about telling me why I was hallucinating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Syphilis could explain the hallucination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I'm not sexually active.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You don't have to admit you did anything with the kid. You weren't always a priest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I wanted to be since I was 12. I entered the seminary when I was 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe it wasn't a hallucination. Maybe it really was Jesus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I'm not insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Seeing Jesus makes you insane? A bit of an odd attitude coming from a priest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Well, it's just a job now. The fairy tale ended a long time ago.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a wuss — part wimp, part puss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have no choice. I'm part of the ceremony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you were already circumcised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's one night for a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What about the friend who has two tickets to Brubeck at the Blue Note?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I thought you had an orgy planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you lying about the Brubeck tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, but only to save you from yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll be fine, and so will Cuddy if you don't show up. I'm surprised she even invited you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It is oddly flattering.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>God, I'm so sick of his stupid stunts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everybody has to put up with their boss's stupid stunts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, they don't. There's HR. There's Cuddy. There's other jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House doesn't listen to HR. Cuddy will let him fire us before she fires him, and I don't want another job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why do you cling to him? Why do you defend him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just because I don't want to be unemployed doesn't mean I'm codependent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm not saying you're codependent. I'm saying you're scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know what? You're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So you wanna quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, I wanna stop a stupid stunt. House doesn't want either one of us to quit. He wants this. He's got two lab rats in a maze and thrown in one piece of cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>S — so what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's cool he's a child molester?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's cool the priest doesn't believe in God. It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Allegedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think he's innocent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He had honest eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm dying to discharge him because he's not sick, not because he's a pedophile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Allegedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You actually believe the kid got confused?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If everybody lies, that includes teenage boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aren't we lucky to have such an interesting patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Had — there's nothing wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The world's most boring case just became a page turner, you want to tear out the last chapter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You want to examine his character, go to a soup kitchen. We are done testing him for things he doesn't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Case is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're not splitting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So which one of you is taking a hike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And neither of us is quitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were fine with Chase and Cameron dating. You obviously don't actually have an issue —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How long are you gonna keep this up? We know you're not —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wrong. Again. In fact, in the last few weeks, it's hard to remember a correct call you made. If Chase had compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron, I’d have fired his ass, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When my mistake blew up, you did everything to keep me from contacting the drug company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To save your license, not your job, and definitely not your relationship. So, badge. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't you see if you can find us a real case. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>How can you discharge me when you have no idea what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We know what's wrong, and now that you've slept it off…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>It's not just a hallucination. I feel nauseous. My foot feels numb like it's fallen asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You didn't mention that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I didn't notice it before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you hiding from someone? Why are you so intent on staying here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I don't feel well. I know there's something wrong with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Which foot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>My left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>What the hell is that? What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Your toe just fell off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Must be my lucky day. New symptom means the old symptom was a real symptom, and I get to keep our pederast priest after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where are Foreman and Thirteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why would they leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and Thirteen is mad that I fired him. Don't worry. She'll be back.  She'll be pissed off. She'll want to take a stand. And then Foreman will convince her that there's no reason both of them should be out of a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Leprosy's a bad fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why'd you fire Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave him a choice — split or quit. He chose neither. What about ergotism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's giving up his career for her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's giving up this career for her. No, normal white blood count. Carbon monoxide poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>They're good doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Separately, they're great doctors, better than you. Together, they're morons. Go check out the house that they would've checked had this been a real case. And page Thirteen, tell her to run the blood for CO. And get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber before anything else falls off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So what are we gonna do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I get a letter of recommendation from Cuddy and find a new job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's it? You're just gonna give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House is right. Our relationship did affect my judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then I should quit. It'll be easier for me to find another job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not like this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We should both quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What's that gonna accomplish? Don't worry. I'll be fine. We'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'll see you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll be home early. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You really think House is done with Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you ask me, Foreman should be done with Thirteen. He's not gonna get a better job, which means he'll end up resenting her for losing this one, which she'll end up resenting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or the hardship'll bring 'em closer together. She'll invite friends over for Foreman to share.  No leaks in the heater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's not a nympho. She's bisexual, which, by the way, means she's accustomed to partners who don't need a map to find the treasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> CO poisoning might have come from these cigarettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Not unless he was smoking them in a bell jar. And even if you know where the treasure is, it can still be pretty hard to dig it up without a shovel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can buy a shovel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's see… How do I keep House from ruining my precious display of religious hypocrisy? I know, I'll pressure him to attend, knowing that he'll never agree to anything I actually want him to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I didn't pressure you. I invited you. And there's nothing hypocritical about recognizing your heritage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you keeping kosher now, wearing four-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god Ra? Wait, is that one your people? Do it all, do nothing, or option "C" — you're a liar and a hypocrite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, for better or for worse, you are a part of my life. It isn't a ploy. It's a sincere invitation. I honestly want you to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn't miss it for the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm glad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You idiot. I was free and clear. Now he's coming, and it's your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Since when have your failed attempts at communication through lies become my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Since you forgot how to keep your mouth shut. You messed it up, and now you're gonna fix it. And you're gonna keep my name out of it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Stable. Necrosis doesn't look to be spreading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I was talking about Foreman. Is he really gonna leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's usually what people do when they get fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why are you biting my head off? I was just wondering what he was gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're right. I'm sorry. It's not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not House's fault either. He gave you guys a chance, you blew it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Uh, he didn't give us a chance, he gave us an ultimatum. I would've thought five years here would buy a mistake or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Help me! Help me! I can't breathe! Feels like something's on my chest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Looks like a heart attack.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I assume you've heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can't override him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not asking you to override him. I'm asking for a letter of recommendation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Eric, the reality here is… House should've fired you. You falsified medical records, put this hospital's reputation in jeopardy. You're lucky you still have a license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I can't get a decent position at another hospital without a recommendation.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Chest pain wasn't angina. EKG ruled out heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So the good news is, he didn't have a heart attack. The bad news is, I apparently fired the only guy who actually knows what a heart attack looks like. So the man of God who doesn't believe in God had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack. Do I know how to pick awesome cases or what? Could be a clotting disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Three different symptoms, three different clots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. How cool is that? You two do an angio.  You don't want to work, so why don't you just go get me a lottery ticket? The sicker he gets, the luckier I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you really a virgin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>You have to treat me. You don't have to believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And before we treat you, we have to diagnose you. Not knowing whether we can believe you is making that difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Everything I've told you is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lost your faith because a teenager got confused?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>And the church abandoned me, and my God forsook me, and I couldn't come up with a reason why God would do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> God gave the church and the kid free will. Their exercise of that free will hurt you. Means you're just a victim of God's gift to mankind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning. Life's meaningless without free will. With free will, there's always suffering. So, God wants suffering. I got tired of that argument before I even finished saying it. And even if I bought that, what the hell is God doing? You know just the big stuff? The acts of God, the hurricanes, the earthquakes, the random killings of millions of innocent people. Then we better damn pray.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>No, it's fine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Regional anesthesia is a new symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not if the chest pain is related to the numbness. It's not circulatory. It's neurological. Run a nerve-conduction study. And be careful. If you kill him, he'll be dancing with the dark one. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay? Okay, you won't go?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You always have a reason. It's usually a bad one, but a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's being childish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>See, that's an example from the bad category. Is it resentment? The stork brought home a new baby, and you don't want to share mommy? Or you just can't stand to see others happy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I did an ER rotation in Miami. If I can find another position, I figure House will rehire Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Don't quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cuddy wouldn't give Foreman a recommendation. He's not gonna be able to find a decent job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You think they should split up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Office romances are a bad idea.  We beat some very long odds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wow, why don't you save the gushy stuff for the wedding?  House is playing with you. If you let him get away with it, he's not gonna respect you anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or House is helping you. He knows it probably won't work out. And he's actually doing you a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, that sounds a lot more like House.  I know they're looking for someone at Mercy. I'll make a call.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Your boss always like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Usually worse. Finding a fellow atheist always makes his day. Think it's possible maybe God's testing your faith?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>No, I already failed. There'd be no point in what he's doing to me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Got something. Looks like intercostal neuralgia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Something's traumatizing one of the nerves that runs along your ribs. Explains the chest pain and numbness. Could also cause muscle atrophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content> Does it do anything to the eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why? What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you seeing Jesus again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I'm seeing nothing. My right eye went blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ophthalmological exam's normal. Nothing structurally wrong with the eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>His heart rate's down. Sensory loss is becoming more diffuse, progressive muscle weakness — he's shutting down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's got to be something systemic, like autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>CSF was clear for Guillain Barre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Imaging studies have been clear for tumors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then that leaves infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He'd be brimming with white blood cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or we are at the back stage door of a Duran Duran concert. Hundreds of screaming girls clustered around. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That girls like rock bands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The presence of the fans indicates the presence of the band. Different night — same band, same door. Now there's not a girl in sight. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sorry, I don't speak hair band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>They weren't a hair band. They were new romantics. The band already left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, the band's still there, still rocking out. When does the absence of the fans not indicate the absence of the band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When it's 2009. There aren't any Duran Duran fans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They don't make ‘em anymore. If there's no infection, it's because there aren't any fans, no white cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think, his spleen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out? Yes, I think it's his spleen. Go get a biopsy. I'll try to get "New moon on Monday" out of my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you talking this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> If I quit, will you rehire Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-32"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He can't find another job. I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you're willing to make that sacrifice for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-34"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does Foreman know about this plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-36"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if he's okay with it, who am I to say no?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>You think it's my spleen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's what they're testing. So if I happen to cure you, what happens then? You start thinking that God was working through me? This is some sort of miracle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Do you think I'm an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's what I'm testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Losing my faith wasn't a choice I made. It happened. It's gone. For good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But if it can magically disappear, it can magically reappear, and that's what you're hoping. Your job…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's my point. You can make more money frapping decafs, and yet you're still ministering to the meek. Why do the lord's work if the lord has left the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I've been with the church my entire adult life. It's my only marketable skill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I detect the stink of leftover faith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>You want to talk hypocrisy, what about you? You act like you don't care about anyone, but here you are saving lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Solving puzzles. Saving lives is just collateral damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Yeah, nice try. I don't think you're looking for somebody to prove you right. I think you're looking for somebody to prove you wrong, to give you hope. You wanna believe, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore trees, but I don't think it's a good idea to tell people to go fornicate with fruit. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, I was just talking about you… Not you specifically — whores and hypocrisy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You were right. I don't want you there.  It's a special occasion filled with love and acceptance, and the last thing I need is someone there who's filled with loathing and contempt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's it? You're really not coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm really not coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're welcome. Gosh, I feel so grown up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> He's obviously just jerking you around, wants to see if you're serious. If you just stick it out, I think he'll bring Foreman back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't, and even if I'm wrong, I think you should still split up. It's just a matter of time before one of you finds the other in bed with another woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This coming from the relationship expert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>12 years and counting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hey, if you can make it that long, then anyone can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Funny how the two people in the room who think relationships are easy are both single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I don't think they're easy. That's why I think if you find something that could be good, you should hang onto it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Everything could be good. Very little ever is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> His spleen is fine, just some insignificant traces of minor bugs. Nothing that'd make him sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which minor bugs?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why do people suddenly find religion when they have kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Fear of the unknown. Cornerstone of faith. I think it makes perfect sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it makes sense because it doesn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>The fact that you're railing about it doesn't make a lot of sense. You really got a thing for your boss, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've got a thing for my boss's thing. She doesn't have a thing… per se. I'm big on metaphors. What about you? 29 years of celibacy. What's holding you back now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Who wants a relationship with a priest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who wants a relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's the holy water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We assumed if it was an infection, it had to be something big and nasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But he has pneumocystis, a harmless bug that's everywhere and never makes anyone sick, unless they have a compromised immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So father Nietzsche has AIDS.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Impossible. I've never had a blood transfusion. I've never done IV drugs. I've never had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So prove it. Have an AIDS test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>No. I know I don't have AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We can't treat you until we know what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>A negative result proves nothing. On the off chance it's a false positive, I permanently lose any credibility I have left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'd say you just lost that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content> I'd say I lost that with you a long time ago.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We should start treatment for AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We need to be sure. The antiretrovirals could fry his heart, his liver, his kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm willing to take that chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Big of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm more worried about the kid he molested. We should be finding him and getting him tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You don't think he already got tested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that's a chance I'm not willing to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Legally, we can't inform sexual partners about STDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This isn't some middle-aged barfly who likes it bareback. This is an innocent kid who was molested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You just want to rub the priest's face in it, get him transferred again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, heaven forbid a diddler has job issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And you get brought up on charges. I've lost enough doctors this week. Treat him for AIDS. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It would depend on what she was serving. Everyone's a hypocrite. Why are you suddenly so obsessed with Cuddy's particular brand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just making conversation. Would you rather we go back to talking about mushrooms and cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You're the hypocrite! You want to go! You don't resent this baby. You wanna be a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, but not until her 16th birthday… in some states.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. You two deserve each other. If you wanna go, just go and act like a human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow, solid advice, except for two things. I'm acting like I don't wanna go because I don't wanna go, and…  I am incapable of acting like a human being. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're overreacting. We'll talk about this later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, that's what this is about. It's about you taking control. It's about you not being able to handle me saving your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And you're not being controlling right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah! Who's the controlling bitch now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You never wanted to take that other job. You never wanted to save me. You wanted to offer to save me so you wouldn't feel guilty. You knew I'd say no. That's why you're so mad right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're an idiot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Welcome back.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>AIDS meds aren't gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If you'd let us do a test, we could stop treating you, or you could stop lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content> I know the feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>BP's climbing. You feeling okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>No, I feel flushed. Ah, I’m burning all over. Ah, my chest. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not a new symptom. It's just a reaction to the AIDS meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yeah, he reacted by getting worse. Means it's not AIDS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So went Satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote Job sore with boils.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think it's hyper-IgE syndrome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I prefer the colloquial term "Job syndrome." Explains the symptoms, and my quote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's the first thing I checked. IgE levels are normal. Could be some other genetic disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cerebral microtumors could explain the blindness and the hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We didn't find any tumors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's why I didn't say "tumors." I said "microtumors."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So your explanation doesn't depend on us being major morons, just morons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We should start genetic testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It takes too long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So we start treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Treatment is surgery. We can't open him up without confirmation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So your position is we can't test and we can't treat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>My position is you're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This isn't gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I've never felt more alive. Conflict breeds creativity. Go run the genetic tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>So now you don't think I have AIDS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I still think it's AIDS. On the off chance it isn't, we're pursuing other avenues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>He's, um… he's dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, we don't know what's wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>Can I speak to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't think that's a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Um, why don't I get you —  Come on, Ryan, now's not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content> I'm sorry…  For everything.  I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content> I know. I know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. But please, feel free to blather on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Raising a child on her own is scary. She's just doing what you do, what everyone does — trying to avoid pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Religion is not the opiate of the masses. Religion is the placebo of the masses. If you're saying she's not a hypocrite —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not. I'm trying to give you a rational reason to overlook her hypocrisy so you don't feel like a hypocrite for going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. Continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. Even if an absolute truth exists, we can't know all of it, and you can't condemn her for recognizing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you eliminating symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can know everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is medicine not metaphysics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Truth is truth.  It fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It doesn't fit. You can't eliminate a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can if it's not a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not a symptom. </content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're not gonna die. You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. It impairs your immune system, makes you susceptible to all the AIDS stuff without actually having AIDS. And you didn't catch it. You were born with it. Another gift from God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Genetic test should confirm it, but it explains all your symptoms — toe, chest, eyes, skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>What about my hallucination?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Scotch explains that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>But that was just a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Coincidences do happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>That coincidence is what brought me to you in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You promised you wouldn't go there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fact that I was wrong is not a proof of God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I'm just trying to understand how my life could completely turn around in a single day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't worry. Your life will go back to sucking soon enough. Everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Everybody would've discharged him, House included. He only took that case as a stall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And yet it was a real case, and he solved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>By violating his own principles and ignoring the admitting symptoms. Still he somehow got away with it. Saved another life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yep. Bad weather for it, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe your sister will decide the roads are too dangerous to drive on.</content></utterance>
