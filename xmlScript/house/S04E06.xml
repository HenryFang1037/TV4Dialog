<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content> Yeah,  at about two hundred and fifty feet, the car got out of shape a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content> But about halfway down... I just got into the zone or something. I pedaled it back into the groove! It was the coolest ride of my life!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You don't care about the crying or the drama 'cause you won't see the patient. And you'd treat Methuselah if his snot had an interesting color. It means you've already decided which case you wanna take next.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>You're gonna take a case based on the car she drives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nothing says "thanks for saving my life" like a test drive in a car that accelerates faster than a space shuttle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You can't save her life, 'cause she's not dying. Her lab shows signs of dehydration. Means the problem's just likely... heatstroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Kinda hard to get heat-struck in four-and-a-half seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Not when you're wearing a three-layer fireproof suit.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>May we talk in private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So... either it's heatstroke, in which case we take the afternoon off, or it's one of the diagnoses that you guys are gonna have for me in... two minutes.  You're in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Your dad's either a cop or a security guard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>One of our employees just returned from an assignment sick. We believe he may be the victim of an assassination attempt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Sure. You wanna close the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content> Door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, I assume you're gonna drop trou at some point during the dance. I don't see why I should share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>This isn't a joke. If you're willing to help us, we need to leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If I have to walk somewhere, there better be at least five girls involved. And they better be working their way through college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Okay, what do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Hereditary brain disorder, transient ischemia, or paraneoplastic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>None of those go away with IV fluids. It's heatstroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Or Cushing's or calcium deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> Who's your friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>We use the term "life partner".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Get a fresh history, neurological exam, and an MRI of her head.  Fifteen minutes for the lap dance, a half hour to scrub the guilt off my soul.  See you in forty-five.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>Dr. House, we need to hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, we need to hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Little advice, I mean, obviously the Village People played out the whole cop thing. But, come on, CIA? Do you seriously expect anyone to believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>It helps when you have props.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Keep your eye on my pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Any nausea or vomiting before the seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content> No. My dad had some, but he's always like that before a race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It coulda been food poisoning. You two eat breakfast together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Any history of sciatica or spinal injury?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> Abnormal deep tendon reflex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Really? Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>I didn't say it wasn't there. I said it was abnormal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>We're gonna give you an MRI to be sure, but I'm guessing your symptoms were caused by just dehydration and the heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content> You're guessing? Look, I make a living driving three hundred miles an hour, which makes the ability to stay conscious kind of important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> I'm sure it's just heatstroke. But we're gonna do an MRI to be extra careful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>You said you left your cell in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content> I wasn't going to take it, just tell you to turn it off for takeoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I know... just wanted to see if you could tell that I was lying. Useful information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Yeah?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm on a top-secret mission for the CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Right. There was nothing on your racecar driver's CT, and the history and physical were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Her deep tendon reflexes seemed a bit weak to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Areflexia could mean Miller-Fisher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yes, areflexia could mean Miller-Fisher, but since the reflex was weak, not absent, doesn't mean anything. I'm releasing her. You can go back to your poker game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Poker's illegal. CIA would never allow illegal activity...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Why? What happened?</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LATER</speaker><content/></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Wait, she could stop breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>You said there was nothing wrong. You said you were sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You just had another seizure. Clearly, there's something wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>So why should I trust you to figure out what it is?  Where's Dr. House? I'm at this hospital bec...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's gonna be all right. We just need to start the plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>No! It's not going to be all right, because you obviously don't have a clue what you're doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>I'm not letting you touch me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content> Honey, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>I wanna see House! Where is he?</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Looks a lot better on '24'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I take that back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Dr. Samira Terzi. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House. We really appreciate the consult on such short notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>There's nothing that gives me more pleasure than helping out a colleague.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>This is Dr. Sidney Curtis from the Mayo Clinic. He's also agreed to help with the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content> Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>"Curtis on Immunology" Sidney Curtis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content> Oh, you've read it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope! But it is keeping my piano level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So... where is the poor, sick fella?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I don't know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>She needs treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>This is a test, right? You're reporting back to him everything we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Yeah. And I asked the patient to be uncooperative. Personally, I think she overplayed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>She's being uncooperative because you made us all look like idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>We're only gonna look like idiots if we can't figure out how to get her to agree to the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>What would House do right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> We can do that last part. She's never met House before, has she? Who's got a cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>House isn't here. We're not gonna act like him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I, uh... I'm gonna do what doctors aren't supposed to do. Admit I made a mistake. I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss your symptoms. But you need to let us start the plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content> What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Honey, do you know where you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>She's burning up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Start the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>We can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>You've got my permission. She's obviously confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It doesn't matter anymore. Miller-Fisher doesn't cause delirium and fever.  I don't know what this is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>I'm afraid there are going to be some limitations on his medical history. Just let me know what you need, and I should be able to provide it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>FYI, my malpractice insurance doesn't cover alien autopsies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>That's fine. X-Files are the next wing over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>Where was the patient when he first felt ill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Sorry, that's classified. But assume there aren't too many places in the world John hasn't been. And, yes, John's a cover name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>And what makes you think it was an attempt on his life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Sorry, can't tell you that either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>Well, what can you tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, did Oswald really have sex with Marilyn Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content> Good Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Very professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Five days ago, he was 185 pounds. Perfect health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Fever and delirium rule out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Uh, he's not gonna hire you just because you call him the most. Especially since it's obvious he doesn't wanna be called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Symptoms rule out Miller-Fisher. MS fits better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>Progression's too fast. More likely meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Areflexia doesn't fit as well with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>That's even slower than MS. It's lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>I'm with the little man  on this one. It's attacking the body and the brain. Classic autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Flirt all you want, but I should warn you - shiksas are for practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Lupus this aggressive wouldn't spare her kidneys. It's primarily neurological. Let's start her on...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> Why no plaques on her MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>MRI was inconclusive. So I don't know why...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> So now you're sure that it's MS. Just like you were sure it was Miller-Fisher an hour after you were sure it was heatstroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>The symptoms fit. Start her on interferon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>We're not gonna score any points with House if we solve this just by running your errands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I get that you want to be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>You don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I'm just trying to save the patient, not score points with my boss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts, but they taste like a horse's lower-than-chestnuts. Which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>And seeing as how he was prowling the back alleys of...  Tehran?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>It wasn't Tehran. It was...  Oops. You almost got me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>You know I can't tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Well, then, why are we here? You might as well just Google "poison".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content> All they would tell me is  he spent the last eleven months in Bolivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Who you gonna kill in Bolivia? My old housekeeper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>We don't kill people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Who are you gonna marginalize? If it is my housekeeper, she has it coming. Cleaning the windows means cleaning both sides.  Am I right, or am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content> What does it matter what he was doing? The guy's dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not anymore. I know what's poisoning him. And who - John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>It's just pancreatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>He's not an alcoholic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>And unless his pancreas is in his fingers...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Spies can't get fungal infections?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>So, either we go with his theory of the non-drinking drunk, or he was poisoned by some group with the resources to make it completely untraceable. Some customized isotope.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>We don't kill people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Right. You just lie to your friends and family, establish false identities, trick people into betraying their country. He'd never cover up his drinking. He's too honest.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> Don't forget self-pitying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Vitamin C. Extremely high doses. It was experimental treatment protocol in the fifties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>And they haven't finished yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>They... lost funding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>That's because there's no logical reason Vitamin C would cure polio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Well, someone thought there was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Someone thought black people made excellent farm implements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>I'm not talking about hurting anyone. I just wanna force feed her some orange juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You wanna throw in some bacon and eggs as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>If there's anything you learn today, it's gotta be that you can be wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>I'm dying, aren't I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Probably.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>We're gonna attempt an experimental protocol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>A new drug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>An old one. Vitamin C. Ultra-high doses have been shown to destroy the polio virus and heal nerve damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content> She could regain use of her legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> But we're gonna try. Don't give up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content> Nausea's... not as bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Radiation sickness has a latency period. You'll get better before you get worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>You wanna know what I really did down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Only if it's interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content> The women there... during Carnival, they... they do this dance. They call it the Devil Dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>I spent all forty days with this attaché to the Minister of Defense. The most... buttoned-down woman you'd ever meet. You know? 'Cept when she did this dance. She agreed to tell me stuff...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, we have half a good story there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Karma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Best way to rid yourself of that guilt is to confess your sins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>This pain is... right. It's comforting. It makes me think that... somehow, it all makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What do you mean, forty days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>When they found out... what she... told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days.  You have any idea what a chestnut looks like?</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Who are you calling an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Whoever knew that John was stationed in Brazil, not Bolivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>Brazil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Well, then, I guess I'm talking to you, idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>It's the same region. It's the same parasites, same diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>But not the same language. In Bolivia, chestnuts are chestnuts. Brazil, on the other hand, it's castanhas-do-Pará, literally, "chestnuts from Pará". Because it would be stupid for people from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>So he ate Brazil nuts. Big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts. Which is a big deal, because they contain selenium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Which, in high doses, causes fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation, discharge from the fingernail beds, and hair loss. Any of that sounding familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>Can you treat it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>We've already started. Treatment's chelation, same as for radiation sickness. The only difference is it works a lot better on nut poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>AGENT SMITH</speaker><content>So what's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Why is she shivering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Low serum calcium is a side effect of the treatment. I can give her a calcium supplement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>My arm hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Infusion rate has to remain high for the treatment to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>LOU ALFONSO</speaker><content>Is it working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You feel that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASEY ALFONSO</speaker><content>Yeah.  It hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>It's working. This is fantastic.</content></utterance>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>There's a lot you can learn in my fellowship. A few new procedures I could teach you. 'Course, we'd need a nurse to prep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>I know how to kill a man with my thumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Actually, I was just trying to make another euphemism for sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>So was I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>Oh, God. How can you flirt with this idiot? He lied to us again and again. He broke laws, ethical codes...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>SIDNEY CURTIS</speaker><content>That doesn't mean everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content>It means a lot.  Dr. Curtis.  Dr. House. Appreciate your help.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>When... when you were dying, you tried to infect me. Because you knew I'd fight for you if I thought I was dying too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You bringing this up now so I'll forgive you for messing with my patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>I'm happy I changed jobs. But I know I'll never have that sort of... excitement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You miss people trying to kill you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>No. I miss... people doing whatever it takes to get the job done.  I guess that's why I'm having trouble giving it up. I shouldn't have helped them mess with your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> They had to screw with me. I've gotten everything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>I don't believe it. You're not gonna get everything right. But you're never gonna get everything wrong.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Uh, where have you been the last two days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Overslept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>We saved Speed Racer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>She had polio. We cured it with Vitamin C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah. I cured depression with tonic water once. Actually, I think there was some gin in it too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Hundred and fifty grams over six hours. It worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>No, it didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I told you you can't cure polio. That means either she's not cured or she never had it. Since she's walking out of here...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>I tested her blood from admittance. No polio. That means Brennan screwed up the lab tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Or you screwed up your lab tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> You must have. She got better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>So it's relapsing and remitting. Maybe... porphyria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nah, that's a stretch. If she had porphyria, you would have seen purple urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>You think it's more likely he cured polio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>They believe it. Her symptoms fit perfectly. And the alternative is unbelievably convoluted. Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her Vitamin C and stop the poison so she magically gets better.  Actually...  it is kinda doable, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>So what do you think? Should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The really shocking thing is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah. In some bush clinic. You needed polio in a place with a proper lab. The only problem is that places with proper labs don't have polio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> There is no money in finding cures for diseases that only kill poor people.  This will make them do research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-22"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> And what do you care if I faked a lab test if it saves a few thousand lives? I did what I had to do. Isn't that what you hired us for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-23"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-24"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You're gonna quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-25"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Go on, get outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-26"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>So you're just gonna let him go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-27"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Absolutely. I'm gonna let him get as far away as possible before you call the cops. Guy's a nut job.  Who the hell did I leave in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-28"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-29"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>There was a reason for that. Next time, listen to him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay. By the way, one of my employees...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story, or  you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing sixteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I was in the Hamptons. I was helping some rich hedge-fund jerk treat his son's sniffles. Fascinating as that sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>For your honesty, I will forgive _your_ hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>The only thing less likely than your helping the CIA is your helping some rich guy on Long Island. You're doing your hours and Wilson's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I know how to kill a man with my thumb.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>SAMIRA TERZI</speaker><content> That's not the offer I meant. I gave notice today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You said you were happy at the Company.</content></utterance>
