<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Daughter</speaker><content>It's for Ted's office.</content></utterance>

Oh, this is the third time they've changed plans since Friday. These idiots think you can just add a 14th floor and the mayor won't notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Friend</speaker><content>I thought turning the garage into a nursery was complicated. Any luck on your end yet?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Something's happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm on it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Morning, Jimmy. Anybody die while I was gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did -- did you iron your shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought about shaving; couldn't find a razor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What the hell happened in Baltimore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, chief. I never kiss and tell. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I think you just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>there's no such thing as "just a kiss."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you iron *your* shirt? Everybody's flash today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Has she left Mark? Is she going to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I think I can hear cancer kids calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you planning on asking her to leave Mark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not sure. Cameron keeps my calendar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey. This is a big deal. This is an affair. Have you even talked to Stacy about what the hell this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't have a lot of time for talking.  If you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great. Breaking up a marriage; fertile ground for high comedy. We need to talk about this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gosh, wish I could.  How did the HIV test go? Did you study up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>I rescheduled for this afternoon. We have a new patient. 34-year-old female. Movement disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Movement disorder? Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This isn't just gonna go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But maybe you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Probably suffered head trauma in the car accident. Trauma leads to the dyskinesia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>According to her husband, the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does the flailing look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her arms spasm uncontrollably and there's a mild facial twitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Demonstration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You wanna know what it looks like, go see the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ooo, snarky. Was he like this the whole time I was gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Patient's been on a fertility regimen for the last 13 months. Excess estrogen in the system could explain--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Who finished the animal crackers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sudden movement disorder could be a symptom of Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If you finish something, don't just put back the empty box, throw it out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on Tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds. Counteract the estrogen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a great idea, if you want to kill her baby.  Movement disorder can present in the first trimester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate. Get a real pregnancy test. You know, the one with the blood and the hormones and the rabbit.  Oh, I'm sorry. It's still your limo. Whaddya say, Miss Daisy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lame duck's done quacking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You quack, people shoot at you. Cuddy just put me here to make you miserable. Another two days, you can go back to making yourself miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Get an MRI. See if it's in her head, or in her uterus.  You're gonna want to paralyze her.  You run tests on a flailer, somebody's gonna lose an eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>You think I'm pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>We need to find out for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Would all this go away once she delivered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It could also be neurological. We need to get an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Can she do that if she's pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>The risk to the fetus is extremely low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>But there is a risk.  I-I don’t think we should do it until we're sure.  Ah!  Ted, I think you should take Stella home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I want to stay here. We should be with you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You should take her out of the room. We're going to temporarily stop Margo's spasms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>You can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Vecuronium. It's a paralytic. Essentially cuts off the brain from the muscles.  Don't worry. Your mom will be just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>It'll make running the tests easier. And it won't be dangerous for the baby if you are pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Let's go, Stella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>Stella</speaker><content>I want to be with Mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>We'll be just outside, okay?  We gotta let the doctors get her better, alright?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-59"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>It's okay sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-60"><speaker>Stella</speaker><content> Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-61"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-62"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your vitals will be watched closely. I'm going to close your lids so your eyes don't dry out.  Just try to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-63"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What the hell did you do? Were you just cold and lonely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-64"><speaker>Stacy </speaker><content>Course he told you, he's an 8-year-old boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-65"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, you're the one who kissed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-66"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why are you so worked up over this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-67"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because you're married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-68"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Not to you.  This is none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-69"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The last time you left, I was the one stuck picking up the pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-70"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Oh right. He cried himself to sleep every night. That so sounds like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-71"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's been *pining* for five years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-72"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're being dramatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-73"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. Actually, I'm underplaying. This is me being restrained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-74"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It was one kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-75"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you being intentionally thick?  This was not just a one-night stand. You can't toy with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-76"><speaker>Stacy </speaker><content>I'm not.  He's probably toying with me. I do--I don't know what I'm doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-77"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Oh, boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-78"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Welcome back to the world. You're off the Vecuronium. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-79"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>could you wiggle your toes for me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-80"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>The MRI was clear. Whatever this is isn't in your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-81"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>The MRI...so I'm not pregnant? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-82"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-83"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>So what do we do next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-84"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It could be a variety of things,  some treatable; others more serious.  Open up. We're gonna run a genetic test for Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-85"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>That one of the more serious ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-86"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-87"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>It's also possible that this is just a symptom of the fertility treatments. Now that we know you're not pregnant, we're going to start you on Tamoxifen to counteract the estrogen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-88"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Will that undo all the fertility treatments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-89"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For the time being, yeah. But it could cure you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-90"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>You can start trying again once we get you healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-91"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>DAMN IT!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-92"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>The spasms are going to get worse now that the Vecuronium’s wearing off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-93"><speaker>Margo </speaker><content>What are you so scared of? I'm still your mother, I'm just a little sick.  Why did you even bring her here? I told you to leave her at home! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-94"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hyper-vigilance, sudden irritability...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-95"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Symptomatic of… lunch with Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-96"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient now defines Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-97"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then what do you need me for? Start her on Huntington's meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-98"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Before we get her test results back? If we start her on valproic acid, it could destroy her liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-99"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-100"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis. Then her kid will never get the chance to say goodbye.  Wanna tell the class how that feels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-101"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Huntington's patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-102"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-103"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Indicating it might be something other than Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-104"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We got a problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Stay away from me! Where's my daughter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>What's happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's having a psychotic break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Margo </speaker><content>No! She's not yours! What do you want with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Calm down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Honey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Margo, you're gonna hurt someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>No! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Push two milligrams Ativan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>How can her Huntington's test be negative?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All the signs are there. Movement disorder, psychosis... It should be Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That'd certainly make your job easier. Well good news for Margo, it's not Huntington's. Bad news for us, the psychotic break eliminates fertility meds; which means we have no idea what's wrong with her.  We give you so much, and you give so little!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know patient is prime age to develop spontaneous schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Almost impossible. No family history of mental illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How about toxins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>None of her family members are sick, nobody at her office, her volunteer group, kid's classes, and PTA members.  All fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work, she volunteers at school, attends PTA. What makes mommy run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're thinking drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cocaine.  Explains the psychosis and the flailing, and the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never ever let Teddy forget that he's a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>I'll go look for her stash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take Foreman. There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I know you're in there. I can hear you caring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The door was locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Means I didn't want to see anyone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House </speaker><content>High school reunion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's for a patient. She can't roll.  Now lock that door, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Paranoia; must be the good stuff.  Times like these I wish I had cancer. So what did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That depends. What did you do, and who are we talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We both know that as soon as we talked you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle. I need to know what she said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have a crazy idea: why don't you go talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She sounds confused, but I don’t' think she is. I think she's waiting for you to do something to show her you're serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wow. It's a big jump from infidelity is morally wrong to "do her."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn't say *do* her. I said do *something.*</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What exactly did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She didn't say it was a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab; too much guilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She left you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Harsh toke, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Killjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I could've covered this. You need to get that test today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>I wish you guys would remember my birthday instead of my HIV test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Forgive us for being concerned.  I got a bet with House.  He says you're too scared to get it, I say you're too anal not to.  I'll cut you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>That was a colossal waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Who would've known? Searching a high-end family home for illicit narcotics was such an obvious choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Cam </speaker><content>Working moms practically live in their cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Little bump on the run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>You were a car thief right?  Ha.  Momma's little helper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>House! Ritalin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cocaine with a PG rating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Prescribed to her daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mommy does everything for her family these days. Even swallows their pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's possible the kid's meds are the kid's meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pop enough Ritalin, it can explain everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, Ritalin maybe explains some tics, some involuntary--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, case reports have referred to chorea. She's been cut off from her stash, so the flailing's tapered off and the psychosis hasn't returned. It's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tox screen will confirm that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system. We're done. Get rid of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not done. We have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet. You just can't resist. You're like a diabetic at the ice cream counter. You want to say no, but you need that chocolaty goodness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, I'm still signing the charts. So until tomorrow, you're not allowed to kill anyone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>We've asked her three times if she's on any meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we don't ask *her.*</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Candy striper.  So, you like dogs? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Stella</speaker><content>That's not a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Smart kid.  Are you always such a good little girl? Or does mommy sometimes say you're the reason she needs a double martini?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Over here, kiddo. I'm talking to you. Focus. It must be because you're off your meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>Margo </speaker><content>Who *are* you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Doctor *and* candy striper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>She's not on any medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well that's strange, because this bottle has her name on it.  And I think these are medical pills inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>What's he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Doctor prescribed Stella… a few months ago. I never told you about it because I never gave her any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty.  You missed a couple of days. Take five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? Unless they're not hers.  You need some water, sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>I'm not taking Ritalin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on. All the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>You were on drugs while taking care of Stella?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content> I'm sorry, Ted.  It's a cafeteria menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Should take a couple of hours to process her. Then you can take her home and divorce her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So far.  I'm planning on keeping a chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I'm moving back to Short Hills, I think it's time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It's never meant to be permanent. And now that Mark's getting better…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Much better. Except for the whole walking thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He needs to get back to work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right; saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream. You're running away because the kiss meant something.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>She had a stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Perfect.  Gotta go back to work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, patient's stable.  Could maybe wait a half hour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>He should have been here 20 minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Doubt if he makes it at all. I saw him leave with Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>He's probably just walking her to her car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. That sounds like House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>He's not an idiot. He's not gonna hook up with a married woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I hope he is getting some. Maybe he'll mellow out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>What took you so long? It's midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Traffic. Cinco de Mayo.  You owe me a 100 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You didn't take the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fear trumps anal every time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>It's not a big deal. I had the viral load and antibody tests. It's 99.9% that I don't have HIV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose… nearly 100, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>No arrhythmia. So Ritalin isn't the big problem. Something else is going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Let's play doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I removed the clot which caused the stroke. Problem is, we don't know where it came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Did ultrasounds of her heart, arms, and legs. All clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be a protein C deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Wouldn't explain the movement disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing explains everything. What if it's a crime syndicate? Let's say Ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper. Ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I still don't think Ritalin--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fertility meds are competitive by nature. They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>Fertility treatments have been known to cause endometrial cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which could cause clots. Which could have caused her to stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Am I going to tell him? Still working on that phrasing. How about; 'Know all that stuff you were worried about when we first came here, honey? You were right.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pithy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You already did the hurting part. He just doesn't know it yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>If I never tell him, it'll never hurt.  I want not to love Mark. I want to hate you. I want all of this to be simple, but it's not.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. They get babies. She had a blood clot and a stroke. She'll get another one and probably die if we don't find that tumor. Do an endometrial biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Biopsy's painful and unnecessary. We just did an ultrasound.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Side effects of the Ritalin caused the--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. We've examined the file up and down. Come here. Give me that. Why do you people always overlook the human element?  What do we know about her? Margo…  Dalton; the woman.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman. Need your help here. You want to pull a bank job. Would you go it alone? If you're gonna rob a home, sure. It's a one or two man crew. But a bank. Lookout. Getaway driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So here's the caper. Fertility meds create a distraction. Mommy had 3 refills on the Ritalin in the last 3 weeks. That team goes straight for the top floor. Has no trouble taking out communications , but--the specialist, Safe Cracker. All he does is stroke, blood clot, liver tumor.  Foreman was right. This bad ass even does flailing. Come on. Only one guy I know does that kind of work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't have to lie to me. We're not married. You're supermom. You can do anything. You work seven days a week. You volunteer. Raise a kid.

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>What makes you think that I don't--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>What are you going to tell my husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That I'm canceling the surgery. You can do the explaining. It's tricky, huh? It's one thing to say you can't have a baby. It's another to say you don't want one. Personally I'd make up some other lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Could--could I die on the table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could you die if you tell him the truth?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have no proof the birth control pills caused this, you have no proof she's even taking them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or, we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Here's what I think she's gonna say.  Oh, I love Greg. But if you go against a patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar. And if something goes wrong, I end up in court having to defend the big mean doctor, albeit with dreamy eyes, who wouldn't believe the nice suburban mom. And even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover up her pathetic lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's twisted and manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...romantic.  I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do we need to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. I'm fine.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So the surgeon got the whole tumor. And it was benign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>That's good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. Benign is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>How could a benign tumor have caused all the symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We believe all your wife's symptoms will go away now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Oh.  Thank God. Look, I'm gonna pick up Stella.  I'll call you after I get the baby-sitter. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Dr. Foreman, you can help me. You could tell my husband that... because of all this... I can't take any more fertility treatments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Confidentiality rules stop me from telling your husband the truth. But my obligation to lie ends there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>Are--are there--is there a birth control method, something that won't make me sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Margo, you're gonna have risks with everything; especially if you're not telling your fertility doctor. If you keep doing this, it's gonna kill your marriage and kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Margo</speaker><content>You don't know.  In a few years, we'll give up. Stop trying to get pregnant. We'll hug; cry. Eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it. And he'll appreciate Stella even more. And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>You won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It said confidential. I wanted to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>The most important letter of my life and you're still an ass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Stacy </speaker><content>I'm going to talk to Mark tonight. And I'm going to stay here with you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>This isn't funny Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Stacy </speaker><content>You... spent all these months chasing me. Now I'm here and you start running? What the hell changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing. Nothing changes. I'm not going to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Who asked you to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mark is willing to do whatever it takes. I'm not. Never was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Oh, now you're introspective? Weren’t so analytical the other night. [Beta Comment: My mom has this saying… about a cow and free milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Shut up about Mark. What the hell's wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I can't make you happy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you think this is gonna end? We'll be happy for what? A few weeks, few months; and then I'll say something insensitive, or I'll start ignoring you. And at first it'll be okay. It's just House being House. And then at some point, you will need something more. You'll need someone who can give you something I can't.  You know I’m right. I've been there before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. It doesn't have to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does. It does.  I don’t want to go there again. I'm sorry, Stacy. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Cam</speaker><content>6 months tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll take that bet. It's the perfect marriage. There's nothing to fight over if you never talk about anything.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What did you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told her she's better off without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. That's probably true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're an idiot. You don't think she'd be better off without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. I sent her off on a whim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have no idea why you sent her off. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This was no great sacrifice! You sent her away because you've got to be miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That kind of psycho-crap help get your patients through the long nights? Or is it just for you? Tough love make you feel good? Helping people feel their pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't like yourself. But you do admire yourself. It's all you've got, so you cling to it. You're so afraid if you change, you'll lose what makes you special. Being miserable doesn't make you better than anybody else, House. It just makes you miserable. </content></utterance>
