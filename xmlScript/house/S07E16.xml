<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Two. That's it. Stay in rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Three. What are you doing, Lane? You're tipping in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Four. What's your problem? Get your ass down. Get back in the middle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Five. You're weak. You got all kinds of daylight under you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Six. Damn, Lane, you should be schooling this bull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Seven. Get up, set your hips before the kick comes down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Nice recovery. Now just wait till he turns back away from your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Whoo! Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cowboy</speaker><content>Lane. Lane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>What the hell just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cowboy</speaker><content>I was about to ask you the same thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And that I'm back on Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She told me you had taken a Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And then I took a lot more.  And so on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But you're fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I'm not fine as in "fine," but I'm fine as in "you don't have to worry about me."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because you cleared out your bank account, checked into a hotel, and started back on Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I'm going to be fine as in "fine" very soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Until that happens, are you sure Vicodin is the…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My leg hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You've been able to handle the pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's gotten worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not physically worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Worse is worse. Pain doesn't discriminate. Neither do the pills. The Vicodin and the five-star pampering that I'm gonna get over the next few days should be enough to get me through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you don't want to just avoid the issue. You want to avoid avoiding the issue. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing is either as bad or as good as we think it is at the time. That's why T.O. mocks his opponents immediately after scoring. He doesn't wait till his friend shows up the next day to tell him to deal with it.  Two weeks from now, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, my life will be back to its usual level of crappiness. Till then, the only real issue is how much I'm gonna spend on hotel charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Good morning, sir. I've got your deluxe breakfast for two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do I have to count the strawberries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Don't worry. You can trust me with anything. Including your food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> After he and I have sex, I'm gonna slit his throat and then disembowel him in the bathtub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Oh, no problem. I'll cancel the morning maid service. Would you like me to have them clean up later when they come to turn down your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why didn't I meet you six months ago? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>Thank you very much. And if there's anything else I can do to make your stay here more enjoyable, just ring the concierge and ask for Carnell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Eat fast. We're expecting company.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. This might not be such a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you think he meant by "anything"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Take some time for yourself. Relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know it's a figure of speech, to underline the "anything."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe talk to someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Already scheduled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm not an idiot. I know I need help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. That's… great.  I meant, like, a counselor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But you meant a hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Baby steps.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House screwed us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ten years of doctors cobbling him back together. Metal rods in every limb. Pins stabilizing his spine. Five screws and a titanium plate in his skull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Can't do MRIs. X-rays are probably gonna be useless as well. Every piece of metal is gonna obscure something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And House isn't sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cuddy dumped House. He's out somewhere expecting us to indulge him while he ignores his job and licks his wounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Cuddy dumped him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Don't do that. Don't get sucked in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He loves her. What? You can't feel bad for him for five minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I can feel bad for him while still expecting him to act like an adult, show up for work, and not go on a booze-, Vicodin-, and hooker-filled bender.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is why for now we're gonna handle the case without him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, is that the reason? I thought it was because you can't pass up any chance to seize control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I said "we." You want "pretty please" too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Wait. I understand the booze and the hookers, but why Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wow, you really don't have any friends in here, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House is a Vicodin addict. He's been clean for two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He's used here at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes, that is very troubling. Almost as much as the fact that our patient</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>What if the hearing loss wasn't caused by the bull? That's just when he noticed it?  Inner-ear pathology can affect the equilibrium and cause disorientation, making it appear to be a neurological disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So how do we confirm? CT is just gonna show us the plate and screws holding his skull together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We can do calorics and an ENG. If he has inner-ear damage, it'll affect his balance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sounds good. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Go ahead? Really? What if one of us disagrees?  I happen to agree with Foreman. Go do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You knew he was an addict before you got involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Didn't end the relationship…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You knew he was an ass…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I didn't end it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You told him you did not want him to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't know that. You thought you were gonna die. Do you really think that was the right time to make this kind of decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. But I've thought about it. A lot. And I haven't changed my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He thought you were gonna die. Nobody knows the right way to react in that situation. Just give him another chance. He deserves it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know. But this isn't about what he deserves. When things go wrong, I don't want to hope that I'm not alone. I want to know it. With House… every time I needed him to step up… He's just never gonna be that. It's not his fault. It's who he is. I should have known it. This is my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, he's back on Vicodin. So you might want to… keep an eye on his new patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ENG was normal. Means his inner ear isn't…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Morons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It wasn't…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Hooker 1</speaker><content>Morons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something Carnell got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It wasn't that ridiculous of a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great theory. It's a ridiculous test. You can't give a standard balance test to a champion bull rider.  If you're gonna test Superman's strength, you need a bigger barbell. Find one, make him lift it, then call me and tell me how high it got.  And tell Cuddy that spying is for cowards.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Just keep me posted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>You said my inner ear was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Previous test was for regular people. You were banged up pretty bad in the accident. But given your athletic ability…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>Wasn't no accident. That bull had malice and forethought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, you mean aforethought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>Whatever. He was pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Can you blame him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>Not at all. If he don't do what he gets paid for, I don't get to do what I get paid for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You ever think of getting paid for doing something else? You're running out of bones to break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>You ever think of doing something you don't love? It has its downside, but everything does.  There ain't nothing like those eight seconds. Traveling around, getting to meet the fans, that ain't so bad either, if you know what I mean. All right, now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're gonna start rocking the platform and changing your visual field while you balance on just your right leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> Here you go, Lane. I'm gonna start slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you start to experience any nausea or disorientation, just let us know and we'll stop the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Ha. That is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We can stop. There's obviously nothing wrong with his inner ear. Now what? And I direct that question not to my boss, but to anyone who has an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it's not in his ear, it's got to be his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But if we can't get any images, then how do we…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> Looks like you guys got some rusty pipes. This water's brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not from the pipes. It's from your mouth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can you pass me the, um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What took you so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s nothing wrong with his ears, but he's got blood in his sputum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn't answer the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We weren't avoiding you. It took us a little time to think up a diagnostic test no one's ever thought up before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apology accepted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It could be a tumor in a salivary gland. We should get a parotid biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, that's so cute. You're fighting over who's in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>GI bleed's more likely to explain the nausea and weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, as long as you're not here, someone has to have the final…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me rephrase. Who's your daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let me rephrase. You have to decide if you're gonna buck up, get out of bed, and do your job, or if you're gonna wallow in self-pity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those my only two choices? Or can I also point out the self-pity coming from you? You're just annoyed because when your relationship ended, no one gave a crap, including you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That is not true in so many ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman.  And, Foreman, no. Till the telephone gets uninvented, no one in that room needs more authority than I give them, and right now I give you the authority to scope his GI tract and biopsy his parotid. And you can pick up the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Wait, House, should we be more worried about you? Are you on Vicodin? Because if you are, you probably shouldn't be ordering procedures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am not on Vicodin.  Do the tests. I have to see a man about a hurdy-gurdy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You really think House isn't using Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Does it actually worry you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>If he's self-prescribing meds, that could affect his judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And does that worry you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Are you being sarcastic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If his rule-breaking is affecting his judgment, then you can step in and you can worry, but if he's just coming up with ideas that we haven't thought of but we should have, then our job is to shut up and do it. And what do you see in this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Hmm? What? Who?  Oh. You think I'm attracted to our patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Right. It's against the rules, so you wouldn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> He's a macho half-wit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You have every reason to not be attracted to him, which is why I ask the question. Why are you attracted to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No, no, no. Take out the scope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But I don't see…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Not the monitor. Look at his eyes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sclerae turned yellow. Did X-rays. Looks like there's a mass in his liver,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Making it, as they say, as tough to find as a hooker who can play the hurdy-gurdy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you have a point, can you please…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's an expression. Means it's tough, but apparently it can be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we don't have any equipment…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not that see through stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You want us to cut him open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only if you want to see what's wrong with him.  Do you know Free Bird?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Do you see what I see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>More suction.  That's impossible. I definitely saw a mass on the X-rays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's gone now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a mass…  And then it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You, uh, gonna introduce us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Team, meet Duke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Anke</speaker><content>Anke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anke? How'd I get Duke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>House, how many prostitutes have you had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As in eaten? Ever? This year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Slept with. Since you've been here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All but one. She did my taxes. On the other hand, tapeworm that burrowed</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We would have seen eggs on a fecal smear or systemic eosinophilia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Detached cyst?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Couldn't migrate that far in one hour. We haven't been sitting on our hands just waiting for your brilliance to kick in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, so how did you shoot down intermittently swollen lymph node?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>That would mean it's some kind of an infection, which would mean we'd have to do a spinal tap. But with his recent skull fractures, it could be an increased ICP. His brain could herniate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about a ventricular puncture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Master</speaker><content>You think sticking a needle directly into his brain would be less dangerous than sticking it in his spine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's probably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet,  stuff is going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just pick a spot and stick a needle in it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>You want to drill through my skull because of a mass that's not there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was there, which means something is wrong. We need to find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Is there anybody you'd like us to call? Someone that you'd like to be here with you? Maybe a wife or girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>No, my family's all back in Oklahoma, and the guys on the circuit are in Calgary at the next rodeo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Ah, that's too bad. It's nice to have somebody nearby you can talk to who cares.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I’m just saying, "it's good to have somebody near by to talk to who cares."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Okay, fine. I like him. So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No kidding. I just can't figure out why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Neither can I. Looks clear. Nothing is suggesting inflammation. Something's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>O-2 stats are plummeting. We need to intubate. Drop the table.  I can't get it in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content> Yeah, right. Very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't trust me?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not?  Anything goes wrong, we just take her to the doctor. And I'm only eight paces away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>House…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like you, Carnell. Don't ruin it.  Stinky feet can point to diabetes, athlete's foot, or gangrene… Pick one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, none. None of those cause bloody sputum or disappearing masses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>No. No. No. No. You're gonna kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't do that, Carnell. They might get the idea that I'm shooting at a hooker.  Fungal infection can cause ulceration between the toes and bleeding could be from recurring abscesses that appear to be recurring masses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Symptoms in the head or feet mean the infection would have to be in the heart or the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I say we start by looking in the heart, because looking at his brain with a metal plate is problematic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So's MRI'ing his heart. He's got a seven-centimeter conductive metal rod holding his rib together. It'll rip him in two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, it'll just feel like it's ripping him in two, which is much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We could minimize the damage by injecting ice water into his abdominal cavity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>No. Please, no.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>Carnell</speaker><content>What do you mean why? She's hurt!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Which is why we're injecting ice water into your abdominal cavity.  You'll feel colder than you've ever felt, and then you'll be hotter… um, you'll feel hotter than you've ever felt.  We'll try to be as quick as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No, it's not. It's mundane and simple. He's obviously a very blessed specimen, so from an evolutionary point of view, he'd produce healthy offspring, so my prefrontal cortex is telling me I should have sex with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh. Is that all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Yes. My rational brain knows he's a hillbilly and an idiot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're not. And I'm worried you might do something even stupider. Why don't you move back in with me? At least until you get back on track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What an ego. You think you're some sort of emotional paragon? You're my rock?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At least I have the good sense not to marry every woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I prefer you to stop talking about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, we haven't even started talking about this except to establish the fact that you are fine, which clearly you aren't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Leave me alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. We are gonna talk about this, and we're gonna deal with this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't have a clear view of his aorta yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>This isn't gonna work. We have to stop.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can't. He has a titanium plate and a bunch of metal screws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So get rid of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His skull has multiple hairline fractures. Removing the metal plate will be like removing half an eggshell without cracking the rest of the shell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And not removing the plate will be like leaving the egg out to rot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can't cut off the top of his head based on a few symptoms that disappear whenever we try to test for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared was never actually there? Any delays when he answers questions?  He doesn't have partial hearing loss. He's missing moments. He reported having something like a complex partial seizure during a bull ride. Said it hasn't happened since, but what if he's wrong? What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It won't. It's just gonna prove that we need to cut into your skull, which is gonna be kind of dangerous. So you've got a real incentive to sing like an angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We think you're having mini blackouts, but your brain compensates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm.  One, two, three.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hate when you do that. You respond to what you think I'm thinking, because you think that I think like you do. It's insulting and annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're scared because nothing excites you. Fun doesn't excite you. Puzzles don't excite you. What's left? And I was saying you're right. You're upset. You're depressed. Everything's gonna taste a little worse right now, but it'll pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not blowing up his heart, because we've ruled out his heart. MRI and transesophageal echo reveal no swelling, no masses, no vegetation, no sign of anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause we're looking the wrong way.  There's an imperfection. How do you find where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't know. Get a magnifying glass and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You suck. Feel free to interpret that both ways. Suck on the straw, see where the drink leaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're saying we put pressure on his aorta until it rips open? You do realize the downside of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we don't rip it, the damage from the infection will, probably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R. where it can be repaired inside the 60 seconds it'll take him to bleed to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's a ridiculous idea. It won't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now if you don't mind… get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. We think you have a Bartonella infection, which caused a mycotic aneurysm in your aortic wall. We need to find it, which means we need to blow up your heart. And, yes, I'm as serious as a heart attack. We're going to increase your blood pressure until the weak spot in your aortic wall explodes. Hopefully we'll be able to fix it before you bleed to death. Any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? You don't even want to know if you'll be able to go back to bull riding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content>I assume no? I mean, you've already cracked open my skull, and now you're gonna blow up my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thought you loved those eight seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Lane</speaker><content> I do. And now you're telling me that I got to give them up. I can always find something else to love.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Since I didn't ask, I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have no reason to believe this will save his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Really? No reason? None at all? I'm just planning on cracking open his chest, blowing up his heart, what, to pad his bill?  Or you think that since you broke my heart I want to break his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't know. I think maybe you're looking for something that can excite you. Fill a void. And it's affecting your judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I think your judgment is compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you don't.  Come on. I got a squash game at 2:00. Let's give this cowboy a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If I inject more, there won't be any room for the blood to go through the rest of his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes while we blow up his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No bubbles, no bruising, no gaps. It's not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I was wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Slow the heart down—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Damn. Clamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We can't clamp the aorta at this pressure. Even if you can see through all the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Do it anyway. We need suction and more sponges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Leak is too fast.</content></utterance>
