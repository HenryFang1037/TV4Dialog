<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>You’re not going to like the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>I already know the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I missed the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>I don’t doubt it, no bus stops near Brad’s. You spent the night, the alarm didn’t work. Or maybe it did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I didn’t sleep with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Girl, there’s...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I missed the bus!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>There’s something either very wrong with you, or there’s something very wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>There’s nothing wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>Please tell me you know that for a fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Melanie, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>You’re lying aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I wouldn’t lie to you.  Good morning guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Class</speaker><content>Good morning Miss Rebecca!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Everybody’s in their seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Class</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Ok, Sidney, why don’t you tell us what you did this weekend. Come on, Sidney, we know you’re not shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sidney</speaker><content>How come we always have to tell you what we did, and you never tell us what you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Class</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Ok, I had a really great weekend, but you can’t tell Miss Melanie, ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sidney</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I made a new friend. It’s so much fun to make new friends, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Class</speaker><content>Yeah, Yes, etc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Girl 2</speaker><content>Did you tell you mom and dad about your new friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Absolutely! You should never keep anything from your parents. And I told them </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Class</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Wh..</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Class</speaker><content>C, A, T, H</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sidney</speaker><content>“The.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Boy</speaker><content>We know that word, “the.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See that? They all assume I’m a patient because of this cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So put on a white coat like the rest of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want them to think I’m a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People don’t want a sick doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fair enough. I don’t like healthy patients. The 29 year old female…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The one who can’t talk, I liked that part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She’s my cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And your cousin doesn’t like the diagnosis. I wouldn’t either. Brain tumor, she’s gonna die, boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No wonder you’re such a renowned diagnostician. You don’t need to actually know anything to figure out what’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re the oncologist; I’m just a lowly infectious disease guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s 29. Whatever she’s got is highly unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No family history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought your uncle died of cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Other side. No environmental factors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That you know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And she’s not responding to radiation treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>House</speaker><content>None of which is even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Come on! Why leave all the fun for the coroner? What’s the point of putting together a team if you’re not going to use them? You’ve got three overqualified doctors working for you. Getting bored.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s a lesion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Shouldn’t we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is she a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House doesn’t like dealing with patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Isn’t treating patients why we became doctors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you’re trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we don’t talk to them they can’t lie to us, and we can’t lie to them. Humanity is overrated. I don’t think it’s a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think “horses” not “zebras”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there’s nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it’s not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn’t she talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get her a contrast MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mad cow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mad zebra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wernickie's encephalopathy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, blood thiamine level was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it’s a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let’s find out what kind of zebra we’re dealing with here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Well, that’s odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You think we have nothing to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, just that I can’t think of anything that I’d be interested in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I sign your paychecks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That would be juvenile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can still fire you if you’re not doing your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m here from 9 to 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your billings are practically nonexistent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rough year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You ignore requests for consults.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I call back. Sometimes I misdial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, I was right, this doesn’t interest me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s 5:00. I’m going home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>To what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don’t fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren’t going to fire me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your reputation won’t last up if you don’t do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, “You can’t always get what you want.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>You’re not my doctor. Are you Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Thankfully no. I’m Dr. Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine. He’s very busy, but he has taken a keen interest in your case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We inject gadolinium into a vein. It distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Basically, whatever’s in your head, lights up like a Christmas tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It might make you feel a little light-headed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Dr. Cameron. I’m sorry I have to stop you, there’s a problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You pulled my authorization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, why are you yelling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You also can’t make long distance phone calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you’re gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Or photocopies; you’re still yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m ANGRY! You’re risking a patient’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I assume those are two separate points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I’m still work here you have…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is your yelling designed to scare me because I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be scared of. More yelling? That’s not scary. That you’re gonna hurt me? That’s scary, but I’m pretty sure I can outrun ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you’re right, “You can’t always get what you want,” but as it turns out “if you try sometimes you get what you need.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, because you want me to treat patients, you aren’t letting me treat patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need you to do your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do the MRI, she folded.  I’ve gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I’ve missed. 2054. I’ll be caught up in 2054.  You better love this cousin a whole lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>All right Rebecca,  we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there, but we need you to remain still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Ok, we’re gonna begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I don’t feel so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s all right. Just try to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Rebecca?  Rebecca?  Rebecca! Get her out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ah she probably fell asleep; she’s exhausted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago, she’s not sleeping. We gotta get her out of there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’ll just be another minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s having an allergic reaction to gadolinium. She’ll be dead in two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hold her neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh, she’s ashen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s not breathing. Epi point five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Come on, I can’t ventilate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Too much edema, where’s the surgical airway kit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yep, coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good call.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just get some rest for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told you, can’t trust people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You actually want me to talk to the patient? Get a history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We need to know if there’s some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought everybody lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Truth begins in lies. Think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That doesn’t mean anything,does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No TV, but we’ve got patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t you give out the aspirin yourself? I’ll do paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I made sure your first case was an interesting one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cough just won’t go away, runny nose looks a funny color.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Patient is orange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The color?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, the fruit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean yellow; it’s jaundice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I mean orange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, how orange?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Exam room 1.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Orange Guy</speaker><content>I was playing golf and my cleat got stuck. I mean, it hurt a little but I kept playing. The next morning I could barely stand up. Well, you’re smiling so I take it that means this isn’t serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Orange Guy</speaker><content>What’s that? What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Painkillers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Orange Guy</speaker><content>Oh, for you, for your leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, ‘cause they’re yummy. You want one? It’ll make your back feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem. Your wife is having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Orange Guy</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re orange, you moron! It’s one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn’t picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she’s just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good lawyer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Little boy</speaker><content>It’s cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Has he been using his inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>Not in the past few days. He’s, um, only ten. I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Little boy</speaker><content>What happened to your leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don’t you think? Ok, I’m gonna assume that no body’s ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your child’s airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids…stop the inflammation. The more often this happens…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>What? “The more often this happens…”what?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget it. If you don’t trust steroids, you shouldn’t trust doctors.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You couldn’t have knocked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mildly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That could mean anything, or nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it’s vasculitus except that it could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You can’t diagnose that without a biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And if we’re wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We learn something else.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Pretty much everybody I like is 5 years old. A nurse said you’re stopping my radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’re just trying some alternative medications. So, where’s your family from then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Steroids aren’t an alternative to radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The tests weren’t really conclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re treating you for vasculitus, it’s the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly.  Ok, I’ll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you’re sick, but if you’re making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isn’t hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the patient’s home for contaminants, garbage, medication…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Isn’t that how you got into the Felker’s home?  Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I should thank him?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don’t prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don’t since Tuskeegee and Mengele.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, I gave her the same test 5 minutes later and she did just fine. The altered mental status is intermittent, just like the verbal skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So, what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Given the latest symptoms it’s clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won’t be able to walk, she’ll go blind permanently, and then the respiratory center will fail.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it’s a tumor we’re talking a month, maybe two, if it’s infectious a few weeks, if it’s vascular that’ll probably be fastest of all, maybe a week.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I still think it’s a tumor. I think we should go back to the radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She didn’t respond to the radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, maybe we didn’t see the effects until we started steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it’s not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don’t know what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So we’re just gonna do nothing? We’re just gonna watch her die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re gonna watch her die. Specifically we’re gonna watch how fast she’s dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it’s killing her we’ll know what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And by then maybe there’s nothing we can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s go to be something we can do, something better than watching her die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn’t explain these symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses. Adler’s not his cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. You can ask her yourself. Can we get back to… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s not Jewish!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I had ham at her apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews have non-Jewish relatives, and most of us don’t keep kosher. I can see getting through high school without learning a thing about Jews, but medical school…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ok, maybe she’s Jewish, but she’s definitely not your cousin.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don’t even know her name! You called her Rachel; her name is Rebecca!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You idiot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey…listen…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not you, him! You said you didn’t find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everything I found was in </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You found ham.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where there’s ham there’s pork, where there’s pork there’s neurocysticercosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tapeworm?! You think she’s got a worm in her brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It fits. Could have been living there for years, it never occurred to me </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Millions of people eat ham every day. It’s quite a leap to think that she’s got a tapeworm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They, they get a little better and then they get worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-30"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just like Rebecca Adler did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In a typical case if you don’t cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-32"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Reproduce? There’s only got one lesion, and it’s nowhere near her bowel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-36"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As long as it’s healthy the immune system doesn’t even know it’s there. The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to shut down the body’s immune response and control fluid flow. It’s really kinda beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-38"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As long as it’s healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s too late for that. It’s dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host’s defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-40"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It could still be a hundred other things. The eosinophil count was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-41"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s only abnormal in 30% of cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-42"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Proving nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it’s perfect! It explains everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-44"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But it proves nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can prove it by treating it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-46"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you can’t. I was just with her, she doesn’t want any more treatments, she doesn’t want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Will you excuse us, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-48"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m Dr. House.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-50"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re being an idiot. Ahem.  You have a tapeworm in your brain, it’s not pleasant, but if we don’t do anything you’ll be dead by the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-51"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Have you actually seen the worm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-52"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When you’re all better I’ll show you my diplomas.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-54"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not talking about a treatment; I’m talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-55"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>What made you a cripple?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-56"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had an infarction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-57"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>A heart attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-58"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s what happens when the blood flow is obstructed. If it’s in the heart it’s a heart attack. If it’s in the lungs it’s a pulmonary embolism. If it’s in the brain it’s a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-59"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Wasn’t there something they could do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-60"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-61"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Did you think you were dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-62"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hoped I was dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-63"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>So you hide in your office, refuse to see patients because you don’t like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you’re gonna get even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I’m so much better than you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-64"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When you’re scared, you’ll turn into me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-65"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I just want to die with a little dignity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-66"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we’re 90, sometimes before we’re even born, but it always happens and there’s never any dignity in it. I don’t care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It’s always ugly, always.  You can live with dignity, we can’t die with it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn’t have the capacity to make this decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pretty common result.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That didn’t happen here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s not gonna do it. She’s not just a file to him anymore. He respects her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So because you respect her, you’re going to let her die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I solved the case, my work is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patients always want proof, we’re not making cars here, we don’t give guarantees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think we can prove it’s a worm. It’s noninvasive, it’s safe. I’m not completely sure but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah what’s the damn idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Have you ever seen a worm under an x-ray, a regular old no contrast 100-year-old technology x-ray? They light up like shotgun pellets. Just like on a contrast MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we’re not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he’s right, we should x-ray her, but we don’t x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she’s got one in her head I guarantee you there’s one in her leg.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are you looking for a guarantee? It’s there, probably been there 6 to 10 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Could I have more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Probably. It’s good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>What do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Now we get you better. Albendazole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Two pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, every day for at least a month with a meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Two pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, possible side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, dizziness, fever, and hair loss. We’ll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn’t respect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is that rhetorical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it just seems that way because you can’t think of an answer. Does it make a difference why I think I’m a jerk? The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it wasn’t a racial thing, I didn’t see a black guy. I just saw a doctor…with a juvenile record. I hired Chase ‘cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You hired me to get into my pants?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t believe that that would shock you. It’s also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it’s like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was in the top of my class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not THE top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, you were a very good applicant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But not the best?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I worked very hard to get where I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you didn’t have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That’s a law of nature, and you defied it. That’s why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn’t, you worked your stunning little ass off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Am I supposed to be flattered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they’re as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m your doctor, you’ve been good to me and good to this hospital, of course I care, but I don’t see how this conversation can end well for me. Either your wife is having an affair, or she’s not having an affair and you have come here because you rightly think I should fire him, but I can’t even if it cost me your money, the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.</content></utterance>
