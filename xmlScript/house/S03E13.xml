<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>What? You’re not having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content> It’s not that. I just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>You’d rather be with the boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Well then, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>You kids need any help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>No. No, we’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Car trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Then why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Uh, we’re just talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Does she do all the talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Uh. Most of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content> I know what that’s like. I’m going to come back through here in ten minutes. And, if you’re still here, I’m going to call your parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Yes sir. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Now, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>We were going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Nine minutes.  Sweetie, what’s wrong? Oh my god!  Help! Someone help me! </content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sixteen year old. Respiratory arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The only thing I hate more than a thief is a crippled thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, me too. No sign of trauma. No history of asthma or allerg…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Who the hell is J. Whitner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No idea. Stevie Lippa, his EKG and Echocardiogram were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Normal is good. Send him home.  J. Whitner. Doctor. Who is he and where do I find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s a new researcher. Works with Erechevsky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is she hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s in a wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Doesn’t mean she’s not hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just means she can’t bend over. So Cuddy has to bend over backward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sixteen year old kid. ER workup revealed a bloody pleural effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. That occurred to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What took you so long to mention it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No tumors or pneumonia on the CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He passed out while making out. If he’s into sex, drugs and rock and roll can’t be that far behind. I’m guessing cocaine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just means he wasn’t on drugs, not that he hasn’t been using drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Looks like a plumbing problem to me. Leaky pipes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If he popped an aneurysm he’d be in the morgue, not the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s why you’re going to do a venogram instead of an arteriogram. This isn’t a high pressure burst, it’s a low pressure leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It still could have been drugs that cause the pipes to corrode in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So go look under his mattress. See if he’s got any pills or powders stashed with the hand lotion.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sweet ride. I asked for the one with the sissy bar and the banana seat but Santa gave me this instead.  I guess that’s what I get for being naughty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>You must be Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. So, looks like there’s been some sort of mix-up at the parking office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>They had to move me closer to the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Had to? You don’t look like the type to pull a weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>Wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cane. I think you should do the honorable thing. Let me have my space back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>Oh, well, uh. Since you ask so nicely…wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cane. Walking long distances makes my leg hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>And it’s easy for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Course not. Pushing that little lever. Thumb muscles must burn. I’m sure the last ten yards are pure torture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>Crossing the parking lot is dangerous. Cars can’t see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ever hit a patch of black ice with a cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>No. Gosh, on account of the fact that I can’t walk. Maybe you should ask the parking office for some crampons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is about who can most easily cross the parking lot. You’re the winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Whitner</speaker><content>Oh, and the prize is apparently a parking space. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s still no answer at either one of your parents’ cell numbers. Is there any other way we might be able to contact them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>No. They’re at a conference. They probably had to turn them off or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>What does it matter where they are? I mean he’s in pain. You gotta do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need them to sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Why can’t he just sign the papers? He’s sixteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still not an adult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Then call my parents. They know him. And they’ll take responsibility, do whatever you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>You can’t just let him sit here in agony until his parents finally decide…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Leah, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>No. It’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I feel like there’s an anvil sitting on my chest. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You win. We’re doing the venogram now. We’ll deal with the fallout later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>My fingers feel wet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s just the dye. Your nerves can’t tell the difference between the cold inside your body and the wet outside your body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>The nerves can’t tell the difference or the brain can’t interpret the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A little of both. You like science? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Looks like a diffusion pattern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s because it’s the venous side. Low pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>So Graham’s Law applies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You taking physics already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>No. Just sort of read up on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Had to teach myself a lot of stuff too. School sucked where I grew up. You go to public or private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Public. Nick has to be in the pulmonary veins to get in my lungs, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I don’t see anything, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Doesn’t make sense. How can I have a bloody effusion without any bleeding?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This is putrid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Put food-borne parasites and infections on the list to check on. I’ll take the bedroom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know there was anyone… We were just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I have a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Look, you can take whatever you want. My wallet’s in my suit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Freeze. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I’m calling the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay. You don’t have a gun. And you’re not calling the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh no, I’m calling the cops. Unless you two get out of here right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Unless? Who calls the cops “unless” a burglar does something. You don’t want to have to explain the affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>We’re not having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s got a ring. You don’t. And judging from the state of the kitchen downstairs and the half-vacuumed bedroom, I’m guessing you’re a better lover than you are a maid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Maid? You son of a bitch. I’m not a maid, okay? This is my house, not his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ah, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nothing. We’re sorry. We’re just here to help Stevie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Who’s Stevie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Your…son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was the address you gave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>The ER must have written it down wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or you lied because you don’t want us to talk to your parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I gave you their phone numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You gave us some numbers. We haven’t been able to reach anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I told you, they must be in a conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>He’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Leah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>He’s Romany. A gypsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So you don’t have a home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Of course we do. What, next you’re going to ask about dancing about campfires and stealing children? This is why I don’t tell people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>They share everything with each other and nothing with the gadje. The outsiders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Sharing information with outsiders has not gone so well for my people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, right now, you’re making you more vulnerable by lying to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>You can’t go to my house. You’ll pollute it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All we’re going to do is look around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Your presence is enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>My parents take it seriously. It’s spiritual as much as it is physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You know where he lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Don’t. Look, I’ll tell you whatever you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If we can’t trust your answers…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I drink sometimes. Okay, I’ve smoked pot. I’ll tell you anything. The truth. You just…  you can’t go in my home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The pot wouldn’t cause a bleeding problem. A pesticide on the pot could. Where did you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Some kid at school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Stevie! He got the pot from me. He doesn’t even go to school. His parents made him drop out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I’m home schooled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>He reads books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What else are you lying about? Is your father really a professor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>He’s a salesman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>They buy and sell anything they can get their hands on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They. So you’re with your dad while he’s making these deals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>He was just in Chicago, a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You fly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>No. My dad’s got a truck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You can’t be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually I can.  See. It’s my space and I want it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s not your space. It’s the hospital’s space. And the hospital thinks the person who’s worse off should get the better space. Your application for a handicapped space says you can walk 50 yards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And Whitner’s says she can roll 50 miles between oil changes. I can’t change my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The space I moved you to is only 46 yards away from the front door. I measured. You’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. So I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As long as it’s not in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know who won the New York City marathon six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then go get yourself one and leave me alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me my space, I’ll be happy to roll around in one all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You couldn’t last a week in a wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wanna bet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing that a week off my feet won’t solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Venogram’s negative. No leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean you couldn’t find the leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is your leg worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. My parking spot is. Blood is only made inside the circulatory system. Which means when you find outside…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no leak. I even checked lymphatics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re going to spend a week in a wheelchair just to get a parking closer to the front door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Easier than chopping off my legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ve ruled out toxins and drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kind of. He’s Romany. Apparently they feel the need to keep secrets so it’s hard to know anything for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s also a human being. Which means you shouldn’t be trusting him to begin with. Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s a deep vein thrombosis. The kid spent 16 hours in the back seat of an old pickup. Causes a clot and makes its way to his lungs. We should do an arteriogram and find the clot and bust it with tPA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or we should find the leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. You can’t yell at a guy in a wheelchair. This is a slow leak. You gotta speed it up. Thin his blood, redo the venogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That could cause a massive bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Excellent. Massive will be even easier to find. Pardon me. I guess you guys are going to have to get the next one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>I thought you were redoing the venogram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>As soon as we’re done with the arteriogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Okay. You’re going to feel a little poke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content> Can you maybe do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s okay, it’s just your leg. I don’t have to go any further than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Take a look at this. Bones of your forearm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Uh. Radius and ulna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How about the wrist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Um. Lunate. Hamate, The…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Scared lovers try positions they can’t handle.  It’s a mnemonic for the wrist bones. It’s the only way I can remember them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Ow, my stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You hit something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I haven’t started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lie flat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Oh, no I can’t. It hurts too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m getting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s the only chance to see what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If he moves, I could shred his artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Get it out, now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s going to be okay, Stevie. Just inject the dye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dye’s going into his liver but it’s not coming out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The clot’s gotta be constricting the flow in the hepatic vein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not constricting it, it’s completely blocking it. His whole liver’s fried.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ow. The kid’s liver’s failing because of massive clots blocking his hepatic vein. How can he have both a bleed and a clot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s not a clot. You must have blocked the vein with a catheter wire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Increased pressure downstream could also stop the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no heart failure or cirrhosis. Means it has to be a clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Massive clots block veins, they don’t even leak. Since he clearly has some kind of… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You having a little problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Would you mind?  Boy, that was humiliating. How does Whitner make it through the day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Pride goeth before the fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lucky for me, I’m sitting in one of these babies. So, what other theories can I shoot down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>DIC would explain both the…</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s no way his parents are going to let us near him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They won’t be able to transfer him until he’s recovered from the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can add the surgical team to the list of people who won’t let us near him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots. Spleen explodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We should test him for Von Willebrand’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or, let’s play tic tac toe. Okay, Xs are bleeds, Os are clots. Started in the lungs, right? What did we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>CT, sputum, two venograms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That’s one bleed, one clot. Then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Liver shut down. MRI, labs. Treated with cyclophosphamide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whereupon, he peed out three units of O negative. And a bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where is this going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t know yet. What’s next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Bladder, kidney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>High resolution CT scan and UA and urine sediment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>GI tract?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You ran the small bowel in the OR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Large bowel is fixed to the abdominal wall. I didn’t run that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because there’s not reason to. He hasn’t been having any symptoms in his bowels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because he’s had no symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lose your keys, the first thing you do is look everywhere you might logically have placed them. When you don’t find them, then you start looking in other places – the medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox. We need to look in this kid’s mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why don’t we x-ray his feet? They’re fine too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because we need to take the center square to block. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Okay, even if that did make sense, it’s kind of hard to do a colonoscopy on a kid you can’t get near.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s in the ICU now. His parents only have limited visiting privileges. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like that kid. He’s got spunk. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t talk now. On guard duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re still in that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What thing? Oh this? Forgot it was even there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know, even if you manage not to get struck down by a bolt of lightening and make it a week, Cuddy’s not going to give you the space. She can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A bet’s a bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes. And that rule outranks the Americans with Disabilities Act. You think you’ve got logic on your side. But Whitner’s got the legal system. And legal beats logic every time. Just ask OJ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you’re doing this even though you know you’ve got no legal leg to stand on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who needs legs when you got wheels. I’m gonna get that spot.  No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Franklin</speaker><content>What’d you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll see you later. Gonna have them yelling at me for the next 20 minutes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mucosa looks normal, healthy. No lonely diverticular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blood pressure’s dropping. He’s bleeding again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m in his colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I am. There’s nothing there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wait, wait. What’s that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The reflection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, it’s something. Looks like a…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Toothpick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Franklin</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He must have swallowed it accidentally and just figured he’d digest it eventually. When you two were making out in the car he must have folded awkwardly, pushed the toothpick through the wall of the intestine and into the lung. Then it moved on to his liver and made its way to his bladder and spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>So that’s it. He’s going to be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yup. Small holes. It shouldn’t take that long to heal now that we’ve got it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Franklin</speaker><content>See. See what you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>If you hadn’t been kissing him…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Leah</speaker><content>That’s what you heard? It was the toothpick. It was that disgusting habit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Franklin</speaker><content>It would have passed right through if he hadn’t been writhing around. Isn’t that right? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s it. Wood absorbs water. Becomes the same density as the tissue around it. That’s why it didn’t show up on the CT or MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>That’s cool. I mean, not cool for me but… A lot of damage for something so small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know, the lab here, they have a paid intern position. It’s usually given to one of the kids from the universities but, if you want, I could probably get you an interview. There’s some entry level stuff, some gofer work. But you’d also have access to a lot of cool things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Thanks, for everything, but I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yes you can. Stevie, you’re bright. You have more curiosity than 90% of the doctors on this staff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Ah. It’s not that. It’s just… I go to work every day with my family, you know? People I’ve known my whole life. I don’t wanna lose that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You could have both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>No I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because they don’t want to let you. They shouldn’t be making you choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>Maybe not but, they are. I’m choosing them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Change is hard. Trust me. I know. But it worked out for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Stevie</speaker><content>You’re a successful doctor. Your name is on journal articles. I would love that. It’s just, I see you with doctors Chase and Cameron and you all got empty ring fingers. You’re alone.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh ho ho ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is my last day living the life of leisure. So, are you going to tell Dr. Whitner she’s out of my space or can I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because, you said that you would. And lying is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I said I would give you the space if you made it a whole week…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You didn’t. The bet didn’t stipulate that you had to be in the chair for a week unless you had to barge into an operating room and shove your hands in a kid’s bowels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How’d you know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I saved a life. Two minutes out of the chair to save a kid’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You lost, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I earned that space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I earn that space every day I limp into that building and do my damn job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You lo-hos-ost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey  You were never going to give me that space, were you? I saw Whitner the other day. She knew about the bet. Didn’t seem that worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She knew I’d win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She doesn’t know me. In fact she doesn’t know anything except what you tell her. And you told her that you were never going to give me that space, didn’t you? Just tell me – do you at least feel a little guilty? If you want to teach me lessons, don’t make commitments you can’t keep. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How guilty does she look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm. About an eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That space is mine. Veni, vidi, vici.</content></utterance>
