<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Thinking’s not going to get you to the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> Mom, you’re supposed to be encouraging me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>No, I’m supposed to be coaching you. The slower you go, the more tired you’re going to get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>There’s a hold about a foot above you on the left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Nice grab! Keep going! You’re almost there, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> I can’t. My calf’s cramping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>You need to get off your toes. Get on the ball of your foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I can’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content> Yes, you can. You can get all the way to the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>It’s okay, I got you. You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Looks like you were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content> Yeah, but you did awesome. That’s the highest you’ve gotten, I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I don’t feel so good…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Okay, come on down.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> She’s been to an ortho, two neuro’s, and an immunologist. None of the treatments have had any effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> You think it’s over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> It’s getting worse. Last neurologist found intermittent numbness in both arms as well as the hand paralysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I meant the game. You think he’s gonna keep all four of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Said he would. No sign of upper motor neuron involvement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>He lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> My ears are burning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Tell him you’re done firing people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well if I lie, that would be little reassurance.  Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Wasn’t me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He lied.  Homie knows better, Hymie doesn’t care, and Huntington’s would have done a better job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> I don’t have Huntington’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That you know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Why would you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Because I got sued when I called you “honeybuns”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Am I fired if I put up —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> The point of the game was to scare us. Telling us it’s over isn’t scary, therefore he has no reason to say that unless it’s true. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Good. Then can we do a Secret Santa? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I liked you better fifteen seconds ago when you were afraid for your job.  So who’s sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Forty-five year old single mom. It’s an odd presentation of paralysis. Any history of drug use?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She says there’s no history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>She’s not a liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, this is gonna be a tough case. I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Everyone lies but there’s an exception to every rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Actually there isn’t. That’s kinda what makes it a rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>The patient’s mother died of breast cancer when she was seven and she never even knew her mom was sick. She promised herself she would never hide anything from her own daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Oh… I didn’t know she’d promised. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>And we’re not her daughter. Patient inherited the BRCA1 mutation from her mom, she got a prophylactic double mastectomy ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She lied about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>She told her co-worker, she told her kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>She didn’t get reconstructive surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Okay, we can rule out breast cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Actually, I was going to rule it in. Paralysis could be paraneoplastic. Even the best surgeon can’t remove every cell of breast tissue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>MRI what’s left of her chest. Set the machine to scan for irony.  I’m going to go redo the patient history.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You mom tell you about all the drugs she does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> She smokes pot once in a while, but not in a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>How would that make her sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Are you a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I’m eleven…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That’s not an answer. It’s an evasion.  Are you drinking? You ever sneak a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I don’t do any of that stuff. It’s bad for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I understand why you don’t want your mom to know, but I’m her doctor so —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>And I would tell my mom. And I would tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Because she would never lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> What’s her favorite way to have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> I don’t get what sex has to do with breast cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Are you a doctor? Did you go to med school since the last time I asked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>You just think we gotta be lying —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> White lies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>What are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Those are lies we tell to make other people feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I don’t lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Rationalizations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>What are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>No, we don’t —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Lies of omission?  Saddle bronc or doggie? That’s sex talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> She used to like being on top, but now she likes to be on her stomach. That way she doesn’t have to see them looking at her scars.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It’s child abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Honesty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There’s a reason that everybody lies. It works. It what allows society to function, it’s what separates man from beast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You wanna know every place your mom’s thumb has been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I’m sorry I missed rehearsal. Am I taking the “truth is good” side? Don’t you usually take that part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good… No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like children. Hard work, but they’re worth it. Because the future depends on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You are so full of love… or something.  When you care about someone —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You lie to them! You pretend that their constant ponderous musing are interesting. You tell them they’re not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I stand corrected and may I say, it’s been a real pleasure chatting with you.  Sila’s clean, surgical margins looks clear. No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing. It’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We need a new theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Did you catch her lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Wouldn’t “no” have been a shorter answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you not talking have made this a shorter conversation? Kid says mom’s a slut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> She called her mom a slut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything with a pole and a pulse. Not that I’m judging here. Given her medical history, I’m actually impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners. Which is why we already tested for, and ruled out, syphilis and any other STDs that could have caused her symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>STDs aren’t the only risk in risky sex. Problem in sleeping with strangers is… they’re strange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>We’ll follow up with any recent partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Send Foreman and Taub. They’re better liars, more likely to get to the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content>You think I drugged her?  Use a coaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We’re not cops. Legally, we don’t care one way or another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>But we need to know the truth so we can help her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content>I’d known her for less than an hour and she offered to take me home. There was no need to drug her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> Not that I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content>But she’s gonna be okay, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>As long as she doesn’t have to pick up or hold anything. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> Uh, sorry. I just had the floors done. Reclaimed pine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You always this thirsty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content>I don’t know… Water’s supposed to be good for you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> Dehydration, anxiety, aggression…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content>I’m not aggressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Spastic chorea in his right hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> What about my hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>How much do you weight? About 180, 190?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> 180. What is —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> You took what she did, it could take longer to hit you. Might affect you differently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>But you didn’t give her anything. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> She was really drunk… I just gave her some E, to help enhance things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Have any of it left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>ROGER</speaker><content> Is my hand gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>There’s nothing wrong with it.  We lied.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>I’ve had a sore throat for a few days now. My stomach’s also been bothering me. I think my glands are swollen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Saint Nicholas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content> Patron saint of children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Also seamen, merchants, archers, prostitutes, and prisoners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>Hmm… Must have been pretty hardworking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Or just a credit hog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Open wide.  Say “aah”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>Is it contagious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Only for the next 24 hours as long as you take the antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content> How contagious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Take a personal day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>I can’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I’ll write your pimp a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>My pimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You’re tested for AIDS every three months and… your necklace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content> Prostitutes wear religious symbols?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think they just like kneeling.  You don’t have the skin of a seaman, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant, or the attitude of an ex-con. So, just leaves one left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>MELANIE</speaker><content>Mmm… Two actually.  But I’m not a child, am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You owe me 50 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then you owe me half a lapdance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It’s for the nurses’ holiday bonus. I know you got the memo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Got the memo last year. I want to hire forty more fellows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You already fired the ones you hired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>They work better when they’re scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You were right. Guy slipped her Ecstasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He have any symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>No. Kutner’s starting the patient on hemodialysis and Thirteen’s in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the drugs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>See? Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation, with absolutely no attitude or fear. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Something’s gotta be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>I still can’t move my hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>It will take a few more hours to cycle all your blood through the machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>What just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Nothing. What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>What do you mean? The lights just went out. Didn’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Is this from the drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Most of the drugs should be out of your system by now and our drugs —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>I can’t see…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> Do something!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>FADE IN</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Nothing in the Ecstasy except Ecstasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well that never hurt anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Can’t make them blind days later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Do you spell “homie” with a Y?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I want to be respectful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>You’re actually going to let us do Secret Santa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not just you guys.  I like presents too.  Pick a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> Why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>See, this is why no one likes your people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, because it’s actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>So you think this is the part of the year they screwed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>On the other hand, you are now a team. Gotta work together and the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people so spend 25 bucks. Learn to love…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Blindness could be a complication from the hemodialysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>No, the dialysate composition was within range.  Sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>The dialysate composition just indicates —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Indicates nothing. I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I was pleased. I thought it’d be fun to buy for —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Means… there’s someone here who wouldn’t be fun to buy for.  I wonder who.  Pick a name, then go check out the patient’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Interesting…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We’re wasting time going to the home. Kearns-Sayer syndrome fits the symptoms. [takes a name from the stocking and tucks it into his jacket’s inner pocket without even looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No family history of Kearns. Go to their house —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> They would have told us if there were any other drugs. You met her, she couldn’t have been more candid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You’re absolutely right. Go to their house —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> MS or a vascular problem fits better. They could affect hands and eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh! And whoever goes to their house… get me their computers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You talk to your kid about sex so she’ll think you’re being open about everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don’t want to talk about. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>That’s right. Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Yes! Exactly who I wanted. This is going to be fun.</content></utterance>

Breast tissue covers extensive portions of the body. As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places.

One is, it makes breast tissue swell so we can find it more easily.</content></utterance>
