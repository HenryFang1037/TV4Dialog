<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You don't have to face House every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content> And after today, neither do you. Here's to no more coming home in tears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's kind of like coming to the end of an extreme roller-coaster. Even with the terror, nausea, and whiplash. I'm a little sad that it's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>Let's go. You got your procedure log?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Oh, I'm not quite done. I still have one more lumbar puncture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>It's due today. Unless you want to blow off becoming a doctor and get another PhD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I know. I'm gonna get it done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>I thought you'd have that thing finished like six months ago.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I've been busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cruz</speaker><content>What's in it for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>The satisfaction that comes from helping out a classmate?  How about cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content> Have you talked to House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's 6:00 am. He won't be in for a few hours.  I keep a roll of quarters in the car…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>I just turned in my log and guess what I saw. There's an opening in the Diagnostics Department.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, you must be Dr… Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Remy Hadley. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What the hell happened to you? Why'd you lie about going to Rome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in… drug rehab. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Thank you, House, for respecting my privacy. What a perfect reminder that I'm back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I didn't even know you had a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's that Canadian kid who's trying to be the youngest person to sail around the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Collapsed yesterday during a practice run. Luckily for us, cameras were there.  Corporate sponsors want us to check that's she seaworthy before the clock strikes "you're too old to set a record." Gives us three days.  You've still only got one, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, last day as a student. Could be simple dehydration. She told the Coast Guard she had felt dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> Actually, I'm still deciding.  Uh. Maybe she had a seizure and that's what caused her collapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Coast Guard report says no sign of head trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But what about her back? Look.  Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice. Blood draws every 15 minutes for four hours. Let's track her cortisol. Masters, there's no hurry. There's no wrong choices. At least, that's what they tell people who make crappy choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What's with the sudden interest in her future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O… gets curious about who ends up wielding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No reason to be curious unless you're interested in wielding it yourself. You want her to intern here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you're considering this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP I need to get. So I'd like to go to the E.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Behind the deck. Port side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If her adrenal hormone levels are consistently low, we'll replace them. You'll be ready to launch Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Great. Inside cabin facing the bow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>Sorry, K, I need to borrow mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Paige</speaker><content>The sponsors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>No, Couric's people kicking up a fuss about rescheduling the interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I can take over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Ceiling of the galley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Right. The last time I was on a boat was my freshman mixer in college. I didn't so much mix as hurl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Too much to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No, I was 13.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>And in college?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>I was thinking "cool."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll be back for the next blood draw in 15 minutes. Unless, of course, you'd like to stay and continue bonding over your lost childhoods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Listen, I have a ton of prep work to do to be ready to launch. Is there any way</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Mm, I'm afraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Unless you're up for getting on a treadmill. We could stress her body. See if her adrenals respond. It would only take a half an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's about an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Go. I'll handle this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Um, Dr. Cuddy, can I come by your office later? I'd love to get some advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, I-I'm in meetings all afternoon. Try me tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Tomorrow? This is… this is my last day as a medical student. So I've got this decision to make. Probably the biggest decision of my career. Which means maybe the biggest decision of my life. Although, I guess, if I get married… Um, House has opened up an internship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You do realize if you take it, he'll probably end up firing you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He's always hired me back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And he'll continue mocking and insulting you whatever chance he gets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's certainly toughened me up. You're trying to get me to say good things about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. I'm trying to make you make your own decision and leave me alone. Working with House is great. And it sucks. Often simultaneously. Most people can't work in that environment. Question is… can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Thanks, Dr. Cuddy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You paged me down here and now you're doing my LP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cruz</speaker><content>I got bored waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's been two minutes. This is your 11th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cruz</speaker><content>14th. Listen, your roommate, is she hooking up with that resident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I got to find House.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Rehab? Great cover story. Now I can't ever drink around those guys again, thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>There's a chicken in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, there isn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You lied about rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. She's completely honest, but also completely boring. Watch this. Don't tell anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Of course not.  You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Um, I… after careful consideration, I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, you forged the last one. I only did nine LPs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you know how to do an LP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten? It's time to grow up. Turn that in, the job's yours.  Stop staring blankly and go. No doubt something horrible has just happened to our patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Her hand turned completely blue during the treadmill test. We put her on vasodilators. Restored enough blood flow so she won't lose any fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Rules out adrenal insufficiency.  Where's House? He said to meet him here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>His chicken's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Probably on the balcony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You knew he had a chicken? How come—?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Down here!  Loss of consciousness plus she's slowly turning blue. Can we rule out magical gum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Low cardiac output can cause both. Patient possibly has cardiomyopathy. Possibly caused by Mercury poisoning from all the tuna fish she eats at sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, why are you putting, um, chicken footprints on the floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That clever bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hello? The quietest and calmest of all the chickens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Damn him. Mercury poisoning is out. Red blood cells have normal morphology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Raynaud's. Vasospasm in the ulnar artery would explain the hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But not the loss of consciousness. Cerebral vasospasm explains both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cerebral vasospasm makes sense. Take Thirteen. Give the patient a calcium channel blocker infusion in the basilar artery.  Masters. I thought you were going to turn that in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Um, I, um, been busy with my patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're not busy now.  Bawwwwwwk bawk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>Masters. Still haven't turned in your log?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Still haven't gotten my tenth LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>I was thinking maybe you should take House's internship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>First you act like it's the equivalent of volunteering to be waterboarded and now you're supporting it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>You're weird. You make paper airplanes for fun and hang them from the ceiling. You have a membership to the Einstein Museum and an overbearing obsession with facial symmetry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It indicates freedom from disease. We're biologically programmed to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>The point is you rub people the wrong way. But House is okay with your lack of bedside manner. He's okay with your willingness to argue any point with anyone even if they outrank you. He's okay with your peculiar fashion sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's peculiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Donovan</speaker><content>House doesn't think you're weird, which is weird, but good weird.  Is that a chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I think it's an Australorp. I'm gonna go check on my patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Can someone please explain to me what House and Wilson are doing with those chickens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>They have a bet to see who can keep a chicken in the hospital the longest without getting busted by security. Advancing past the vertebral artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>And why are they doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The place they bought them only had one pig. I'm glad you're gonna be sticking around after today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Really? You want me to stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's good to add a different perspective to the department. Someone who still remembers there are rules other than House's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>If I don't play by House's rules, he won't let me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Find a way around them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I'd have to lie to him, which is still lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Lying about a lie, that's practically telling the truth. Catheter's in. Start the calcium channel blocker drip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Means I need another LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Luckily, I know where you can get one.  You good here?  Let's go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Mm. Decent stick. Very smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Sounds like you've had a few of these. Suppose that comes with the territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I have Huntington's. No need to get hushed and solemn about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why are you lying about rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because the real reason I was gone is not something I want to share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Couldn't you just say that? Should be enough for Foreman and the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> How long have you worked here? House's people have personalities that range from nosy to "pardon me while I do this cavity search."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Do you think there's room for someone who does things differently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. Not unless House decides that's what he wants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>During catheter removal, I got a good look at her cerebral midline. Pineal gland is calcified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Case closed. I'll start her on hormone therapy. Ship her out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I handed in my log.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Yes. And I still broke a rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My rule. Told you to defy the man. Not this man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why is it so wrong that I don't like to cheat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Can we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Not liking it is fine. Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old. Wastes your potential. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You think I'm exceptional?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I can do my job without compromising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hypotension. Low cardiac output. Float the swan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I took a break. I told them I had to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lied. Small one. But it's a gateway lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I care about the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Another lie. You care about being exceptional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>RA is 8. Equalization of pressures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Means she has restrictive pericarditis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Add that to a calcified pineal gland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's never, but—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When it's a granuloma. It's Wegener's. We should start her on steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But she had a high CK. Wegener's wouldn't explain the—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Dehydration does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You had me at "I had to pee." But Thirteen's right. Start her on three fold immunosuppressants. Masters, if you want to fight me on this, fill out a consult form so you can stick around. Welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I'm not back! I'll just be staying for this case.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I ran into Dr. House. He requested a surgical consult for his patient.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Something about this case, he needed a little more help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>First day of your surgical internship, you want to be loaned out to another department. Interesting career move. Drop the form by my office. Don't stay away too long. I'm already well on my way to forgetting you. </content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You ever get sick from poultry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Um, a few months ago from this pheasant-in-a-can my dad got me as a joke. You think that's why I'm sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I think that can was chock-full of a bacteria called salmonella enteritis. Likes to hang out in the bones. Let me know if any of this is tender or painful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Um, this bacteria thing, is this good news or bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Well, if I'm right, that means all you'll need are antibiotics. And you'll be, uh, well, shipshape. Sorry. Couldn't resist. Did you always know that sailing was it for you? That it was the right thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Didn't even start till I was ten. And at first, I was not a fan. Certainly there's plenty not to like about sailing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But now that you're so into it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Oh, no, there's still plenty of things I hate about it. I hate being wet. I hate being cold. I hate eating nothing but freeze-dried food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>That is quite the endorsement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Sailing is amazing. But doesn't mean I love every second on the boat. Doing what you love means dealing with things you don't. If there were nothing to overcome, it might not be that—  Ow.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Salmonella enteritis is a nice catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Thanks. Starting on the soft tissue windows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Once this case is over, you going back to surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>That's the plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think that's a mistake. I think you should go back to surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I just said I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. You said it was your plan. Which means House might be right. And you might be lying to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Would it be so terrible? You chose House over surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My time here changed me in ways not everyone in my life thought was for the better. No masses. Moving on to bone windows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Were those people right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think when you do change, it's not so simple to go back. There. In the humerus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Doesn't look like an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's because it looks like cancer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You have lymphoid sarcoma. A cancer in the bone in your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>Am I going to be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's a treatable cancer. But part of that treatment involves amputating your arm. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>There's nothing else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Um.… we can do chemo and radiation after the amputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>I don't mean after. I mean instead of. If I leave soon, I still have time to break the record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>Honey, you can't be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>I feel fine. Last night, they thought it was an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We know it's cancer. We ran the biopsy three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>You don't know how fast—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Postponing the surgery could increase the likelihood that the cancer will spread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Paige</speaker><content>Kendall, you need to think about what the doctor's saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>I'm thinking about the sail. Like I have since I was ten. Don't take this away from me. It's just a month. I can take extra precautions. I'll Skype you every day and I can fly back if something goes wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>She'll be risking her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Paige</speaker><content>I think we need to discuss this as a family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>She's a minor. You sign the consent form, we can do the surgery. Amputation can be an emo—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>She's talked my wife into agreeing with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>One parent's signature is enough.  She needs you to be a parent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>You're asking me to blow up my family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>On her first solo Atlantic crossing, she scheduled a court date to become an emancipated minor. She'll do it again and she'll win. She is gonna do what she's gonna do with or without me. I'd rather have it be with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I'm stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you're not. Case is over. You're back to surgery.  And fetch.  Oh, that's a good boy. Oh, that's a good boy. Hey, good boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No one will stop Kendall's sail. You need to step in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician. Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>She could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Pretty sure the law of the land states that everyone has the right to be an idiot.  Uh!  I think it's the second amendment. Fetch!  Bring it here, boy. Who's a good boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You are constantly railing against hypocrisy, forcing people to face the truth. This time nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>And made a decision that will in all likelihood kill their daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm fine with that. I wanted a diagnosis. I got it. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I don't want her to die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So coloring inside the lines is more important to you than saving this girl's life? I was wrong about one thing, you are not exceptional.  And fetch! Ho ho ho. Oh, that's a good boy. Good boy. Good boy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, my back's acting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Oh. Um… so what would you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I would keep trying to convince her to have the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>And if she kept saying no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I would just keep—  Keep — keep trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I know there's a chicken under there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, thank God. It's pecked through one pair of my loafers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So that's all you'd do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's all you can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Is it?  Isn't that House's chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Disgusting beasts. I don't know why I ever agreed to this bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So call it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And lose $20? Listen, House was in the exact same situation Kendall's in. He needed surgery, but he didn't want it. Once he was in medically-induced coma, his girlfriend signed the consent form as his proxy. They went ahead with the surgery against his will. Probably saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So she did the right thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Depends on who you ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fetch!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>We've been through this. I'm leaving today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's a stupid record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>It's not about the record. I used to race against other people. I could have the slowest boat in the fleet and I'd win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So it's about being better than everyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Kendall</speaker><content>It has nothing to do with anybody except me. The other racers would think I was crazy. I'd set off on some tacking angle that made no sense to them because they couldn't see what I saw. I could sense the changes in the wind before they even happened. At the top of the game, you play by different rules.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Paige</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We need you to sign the consent form. Authorize us to amputate her arm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>During surgery, we found cancer in a lymph node in your neck.</content></utterance>
