<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m gonna do the three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>Well, it’s better to nail the two and a half than –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s daytime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a figure of speech. Always so literal. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Guy in the store said it was slimming. Vertical stripe…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again with the literal translation. Vogler the idea, Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags, bow down before me; he is gone from the hospital, so things can go back to the way they were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The way they were was kind of weird.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could you look at your pager? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s no big deal, some sort of epidemic. Not my area.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What I’m doing now is important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why do you want me back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you’re a good doctor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>2500 people at the pool center were exposed. They’re being bused to all the neighboring hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s a problem of resources, not diagnostics. No, I’d be completely lost, get in everyone’s way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Joe!  Dr. House doesn’t have a blue slip. No one leaves the quarantine area without a blue slip. You are a doctor at this hospital: act like one. And  take these. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take these, go home, talk to your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned. Everything except your jacket, it’s got a smudge on it. Probably two days old. Which means you didn’t know the jacket had been worn. So either your husband is a crossdresser or your daughter has been borrowing your clothes without telling you. Probably wants to look older to get into bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I don’t have a daughter. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Fever. Does that mean I have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have a rash? Come on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>It’s from my new bathing suit, I’ve had it a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Does your neck hurt? If it does, you get the trifecta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>It’s nothing. I pulled it trying to do a three-and-a-half tuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where are your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>We live in Chicago. I’m here with my coach.  I wanted to see what you were writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go like this.  Now like this. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Take these pills. A blue slip will get you out of here. Next! </content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe something systemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or maybe it’s meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s had the rash a week. If it was this meningitis, she’d be dead by now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You guys figure we’re done down there? The 800 people milling around are just waiting for the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>12-year-old female. Fever, rash, neck pains. Not meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s the definition of meningitis!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, pus in the spinal canal makes it hurt to move your head up and down, but her head only hurts moving side to side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, side to side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn’t fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The three of you, lobby, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those little pills you’re passing out so efficiently aren’t going to do Miss Louganis squat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You just don’t want to deal with the epidemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s right. I’m subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous and evasive tests to avoid being bored.  Okay, maybe I would do that, but I’m not. If it turns out she does have meningitis, you’re right, you win, but if we go back downstairs and she dies… your face will be so red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have one hour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a lumbar puncture. Some brain infections can be pretty clever at hide-and-seek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ll get on her bloodwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No you won’t. You, sir, will research all the causes in the universe of neck pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The list is, like, two miles long!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start with the letter A. And put her on rifampin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Rifampin is for meningitis. You just said –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s why I said ‘excuse me.’ Brenda, I need a bed, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Doctor 3</speaker><content>We all need stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Push me again. Brenda, I need a bed and a nurse for a lumbar puncture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>No beds, no nurses for at least 4 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’ve only got one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Your patient only has an hour to live unless she gets a lumbar puncture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cuddy only gave us an hour to work on the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Back of the line. </content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This novocaine will numb you for the lumbar puncture. Sorry this has to be so public, Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Normally I’m in a bathing suit with 5000 people staring at my butt. I can block this out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>These kids are all very mature. Travel around the country from event to event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay, I need you to hold your knees and tuck your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Like a dive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Exactly.  Good, great. Don’t forget to breathe. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Person</speaker><content>Sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Geez! Coach, help me out here, play a little defense before I poke the wrong thing? Okay, here we go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Ow, I feel, ow, I feel it, ow!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What letter are you up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Torture combing through all that stuff, ain’t it? Real dull. Awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, thank goodness. A lot of people would resent having to do this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Where’s the 12-year-old girl that was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Needed the gurney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She just had a lumbar puncture, she’s not supposed to be moved!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Sorry, we needed the gurney. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay? How’s your head feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>She’s got a headache, and she’s dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She shouldn’t have been moved after the procedure, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m fine, what did the test show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No meningitis, no other infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>But you’re not carrying a blue form. I have something else, don’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Something’s causing your symptoms. We’re going to keep you overnight. I know it’s a little crazy here, but hopefully things will settle down and we’ll get you a room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m not usually all emotional like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Coach</speaker><content>You’re doing great. Your folks will land in a few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I just… I haven’t slept, I’m so tired.  Oh my God, my eye’s bleeding. What is it, what’s happening? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry. The antibiotic we gave you in case you had meningitis can turn your tears reddish. That’s not blood.  But that… that’s blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>That’s going into my stomach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The vials showed blood in your GI tract. We need to find out where it’s coming from. You won’t feel it. I’m going to numb the back of your throat and Dr. Foreman is going to give you a sedative. Open.  Swallow. Now lay on your side for me. And here we go.  Yell “fire,” or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>People, this area is highly contagious. Please step back. Highly contagious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All right. Try to relax, Mary, this shouldn’t take too long. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don’t see any tears or lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All right, I’m in her stomach. There’s no bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There was more than a tablespoon of blood in her stomach, so it’s got to be there. Maybe her small intestine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>30 feet of digestive tract, it could be anywhere in there. We’re not going to see it with this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Believe it or not, this is a camera. You swallow it, and it goes all the way through your system. The antennae pick up the signal from the pill.  We’re going to look at the video of your intestines, see where the blood is coming from, and fix it. Water? Down the hatch. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think I’ve seen this movie. The ending’s kind of dark.  Want one?  How come you did the endoscopy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He asked for help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her blood pressure was high, I was worried –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman is not your boss. When I tell you to do something – whoa. Hold it there. Back it up a couple of frames.  Oh, yeah! That’s your money shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Ginormous thing on the right side of her intestine doesn’t even intrigue you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Does ginormous mean really big or really, really big, ‘cause I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There? A Dieulafoy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh. Well, we can burn off the swollen blood vessel, but it still doesn’t account for her other symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, but it does tell us something. Though I have no idea what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be a precursor to intestinal intussusception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Precursor isn’t causing all of her other symptoms. What else? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You, in the lobby, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hurt my leg. I have a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You had your hour. Three, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us when our time was up. She has intestinal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’ll wait. Two more buses just arrived. We need you downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you need more nurses. But you cut back on the nursing staff so you have doctors doing what the nurses should be doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s true. I wonder if that has anything to do you with you costing us $100 million.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go, be free. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not the intussusception, what about stomach cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does she have any abdominal pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then it’s not stomach cancer. Have you ruled out sepsis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The LP and blood smear showed no signs of infection.  Here. Take these two pills and you can go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, the lab’s working at double their capacity, maybe someone screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No fever, no neck pain. Take the elevator to the third floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong form. No fever, no neck pain, she’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Smell her hair, no chlorine. Which means she wasn’t at the pool. Which means she’s come to a quarantined area because she’s a idiot or she’s insane. No one is that stupid. East wing, psych ward, bye-bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You up to Bs? Well done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It would account for all her meningial symptoms. Rash, fever…  You’re fine. Take these two pills…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Get a sample of her bone marrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>From here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Break time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Need more than 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Use Chase’s break, too. Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You should just fire Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, and miss out on all this fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you’re going to torture him for a while and then fire him? That’s cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t think he has it coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, I said fire him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s cold. All he did was save his job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What? He completely screwed you over! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right rudder.  Bank, bank, bank!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Good coffee?  The rest of this hospital is busting it’s tail, and…  What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I am… working, it got hot, stop acting like a 13-year-old!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, you just don’t usually see breasts like that on Deans of Medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, women can’t be heads of hospitals? Or just ugly ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, they can be babes. You just don’t usually see their funbags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your 3 o’clock interview for Dr. Cameron’s position is in your office.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, you won’t. You will interview this person, and if he can put two sentences together you will send him to the lobby where he will do his job. Unlike the two of you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>And I can’t give you a procedure room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I just need something at least close to a sterile environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>I need 10 more nurses.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nonconformity, right. I can’t remember the last time I saw a 20-something kid with a tattoo of an Asian letter on his wrist. You are one wicked free thinker. You want to be a rebel? Stop being cool. Wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut. Like the Asian kids who don’t leave the library for 20 hours stretches, they’re the ones who don’t care what you think. Sayonara. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So should I go through all the resumes looking for Asian names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, the Asian kids are probably just responding to parental pressure, but my point is still valid.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>If it’s good news, you can tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. We’re pretty sure it’s not cancer.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you sure it was an absence seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Absolutely. She was totally unresponsive and unaware of what was going on around her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you mind? We’re trying to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We should get back out there. Cuddy’s going to be looking for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looking, but not finding. You do an EEG?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Seizure frequency’s increasing. They’re almost constant now. 5 in the last half hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which tells us…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s definitely in the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And it’s getting worse.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, can’t be drugs. She’s tested at every meet she competes in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A bleed in the brain can cause seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Rat poison. Could also cause the neck pain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Who would poison a 12-year-old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let’s see now, there’s the 18-year-old has-been that she beat out to make Nationals, the has-been’s parents, jealous siblings, sociopathic swim fan, and then there’s just your plain old garden variety whack job.  Hey! You know what a hemorrhoid is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>Kid</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, google it. And try some Raisin Bran instead of the donuts.  Okay, do a CT scan, check for intercranial bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not a chance, radiology’s totally swamped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If our patient’s bleeding into her brain, she’s gonna be dead in 8 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She could be, but a meningitis patient will be without a CT scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When I was in med school, I had this old professor –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>-- who touched you in the naughty place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Before the CT scan was introduced, he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. Ancient, but if there’s enough bleeding it might work. Okay, do what the guy who didn’t specialize in neurology said. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was my idea!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You actually speak four languages, or you just banking on never being interviewed by anyone who does? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel? Did you fall for him and can’t handle it, or is it the other way around? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, well, pretty much every fellowship ends that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You Jewish? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is it true what they say about Jewish foreplay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I heard four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, that’s great. I think that’s all we’ll need. Thank you for coming by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That’s our Hitler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Her background’s perfect, she’s smart, she can obviously deal with your insanity…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you see her shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Her shoes? What, did your horoscope in Vogue tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The eyes can mislead, the smile can lie, but the shoes always tell the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They were Prada. It means she has good taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They were not Prada. You wouldn’t know Prada if one stepped on your scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, well, they were nice, pointy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly, they were stylish, and very painful to wear. Only an incredibly shallow and insecure woman would rather be in pain all day then wear a decent looking, comfortable shoe, and that’s exactly the type I don’t need around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, someone who can handle a lot of pain is exactly the type you do need.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, my advice is much more subtle. Stop being an ass. You always find some tiny little flaw to push people away.</content></utterance>

Red blood cells end up getting shredded as they squeeze past the clot like a fat guy in a crowed bar. I’m sure you know what that’s like. You’re only 12, but you’re all grown up, right?  Travel on your own, hang out in hotel rooms getting room service with your teammates, maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers, you start playing spin the bottle… next thing you know you’re waking up in nothing but your socks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hah. That’s good. And why I need you around. To keep me in my place. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I can’t come back, I told you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wasn’t listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
