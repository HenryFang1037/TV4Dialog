<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Two pallets of antibiotics for tuberculosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Villager</speaker><content>We’ve got six pallets worth of patients!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Stoia Tucker needs a math lesson. I’m headed back tomorrow.  I’ve got some very special medicine here; this is from Hershey, Pennsylvania. One per person; one per person. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Villager 2</speaker><content>Help, help! Dr. Sebastian, come quickly! My son, he fell. He fell on this rock. We were just waiting for his friends. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I got no breathing sounds on the left – give me that.  Yeah, he’s going to be okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>The fall didn’t cause him to drop a lung; the lung caused him to fall. TB chewed it up. He’ll be lucky to live another year.  Now, this is Sarni. I picked up the tab for the back brace myself. The funny thing is that the brace cost more than the medicine that would have prevented her from needing it. It’s your medicine. All of the antibiotics that we need are right there in your warehouses, in your factories. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>We provide over 10,000 doses a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Which is not enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>You know we’d love to do more, but our hands are tied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>New car, Jerry? I saw it on the way in, looks beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Don’t make this personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>All the way from Germany, too, I know that’s a lot of red tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I’m not like you; I’m not ashamed of making a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>And I know you didn’t become a chem. major for the money. Now you want the same things that I want, you just…  You have to, you just have to push a little, you have to push a little bit harder, harder for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Sebastian?  Call 911! Isn’t someone here a doctor? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Selling subscriptions? I heard twenty and you get a new bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Crushed under the weight of his own ego?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wow. Is there nobody you admire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, there was this gal I met in ‘Nam who could blow out a candle without using her –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He thinks it’s TB. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good thing he’s not the syphilis expert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He wants a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Second to his own. Okay.  It’s not TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you want specifics?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Lemma. Big Knicks fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’ve never had an episode like this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>No. He died last month. Stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin and they only had enough for one.  Dr. House, I’m Sebastian Charles. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patients aren’t usually part of the diagnostic process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, I’m a doctor…. Listen, I know you guys don’t make a lot of money, but–</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I wrote your people a check last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Oh, well… write us another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Talk to Chase, he’s rich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My dad, not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Every minute, four people die of TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wow, how can you sleep at night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>There’re people dying in Africa of a disease that we cured over –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I saw the concert. Seriously, let’s say you sleep six hours; that means every night you kill 1440 people. I guess you got to get some sleep, but come on, if you’d stayed up another 10 minutes you could have saved 40 lives. Do you send notes to the families in the morning? That’s going to take at least ten minutes so that’s another 40 dead, another 40 notes…. Why don’t you go wrack yourself with guilt in your own room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>No, thanks, I’ll stay. I’d like to hear the differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it’s not a good idea for the patient to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s an immunologist and a TB expert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’ll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words, “I think it’s TB.”  What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Oh that. I’m sorry, that’s my body powder. It’s the only thing I’ve found that works in the Sahara. I, I’m kind of used to it, I don’t even notice it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It smells okay to me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is exactly why the patient shouldn’t be in the room. If you can’t tell a man that his cologne makes you want to puke, how are you going to tell him that he’s an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s not an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, you say that now, while he’s in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Look, I don’t have time for this. It’s TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. The symptoms are too varied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, if you haven’t seen 10,000 cases I’d agree that’s what you’d think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told you he’s an idiot. You said you wanted a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>No, actually. My backers wanted a second opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, doesn’t look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsor’s logo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>It’s TB, and I’m not dying. I’m going to want you to plan a PPD and induce sputum to confirm the TB.  Imaging studies will determine the progress, and I think we should probably take a CT-scan of my lungs just so that nobody second-guesses us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn’t want that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content> Hello? No, I’m feeling much better.  Well, what you can do is you can get your board to approve the increased med shipments that –  No, no, no, no, don’t try. No, no, don’t do your best. Just get it done, okay?  That’s Stoia Tucker, and they’re the nice pharmaceutical company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but it’s against hospital regs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Oh, I need the phone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why don’t we focus on getting you better right now? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>What are you going to do, throw me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, just the phone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry, we’ve got an emergency. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s a phone in your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah, I figured that there would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right, I just thought, it’s not like the hospitals that you might used to in Africa.  I don’t know what the facilities were like…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>And thanks for that check. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I should go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The nameless poor have a face, and it’s a pompous white man. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, what a jerk, saving all those lives like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s the emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I can’t remember how to do Walk the Dog. The guy’s sick, he may be dying. We’ve forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You just sent us off to test him for –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had to get him out of there. Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot. Who wants to go first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s right! Tuberculosis could present in hundreds of different ways!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, by that logic, everyone in the hospital should be treated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not everyone in the hospital’s been exposed to it for the last 20 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>TB takes years to kill you. Two weeks ago he was perfectly healthy, now he’s got a white board full of symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about something metabolic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Welcome aboard the Good Ship Asskisser.  Nice day for a sail. Pucker up, me hearties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not metabolic. Kidney, liver and thyroid are all normal. No diabetes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously big as all out doors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Abnormal heart rhythm. White form showed P-R variability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s subtle, but it’s there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think it’s his heart? Sick sinus syndrome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Loose throttle. Sometimes beats too fast, sometimes too slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Causing him to pass out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It would account for the episode. I’ll put him on telemetry; do a stress test and an echocardiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treat him like every other hospital patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Could you give me a hand with this thing? I don’t recall asking for a stress test or an echocardiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are you going to do, walk out? Corporate sponsors aren’t going to like that. I need your forearm. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>What’s House thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sick sinus syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, that’s a lot more serious than TB.  Is that a PPD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If it changes colour in the next 48 hours –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, if House doesn’t think it’s TB why would he have you test for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just covering all his bases, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Uh huh. He doesn’t seem like a guy who, who does that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We have you scheduled for a 10:30 echo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Good for you. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Every minute that we refuse to love one another, another puppy cries another tear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re just mad that he’s closer to a Nobel Prize than you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And yet I’ve nailed more Swedish babes. Crazy, crazy world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s not just a trip to Stockholm, you know. It comes with a cash prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously? No wonder everyone’s going after that peace thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He cures thousands of people every year, you cure, what? 30?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>McDonald’s makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, I see! So you hate him because the lives he saves aren’t as good as the lives you save.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yup, that’s the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won’t accept his blood money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>The top of my head’s killing me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm. We spent a week doing ‘top of head’ in Anatomy. I know just where it is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Ow! That is not the top of my head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eh, close enough for clinic. Your sinuses are clogged. Judging by the scratches on your hands, I’m guessing a new cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>It was my mother’s. She’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You keep a dead cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>No. My mother’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. Poor cat. You’re allergic. We can control it with antihistamine, one pill a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Pills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t like to swallow. Not surprised. Forget the pills. I’ll give you a nasal spray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Steroids? Is there something else you can give me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if you lived by the river, I’ve got a bag.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, stress test was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But his EKG was not normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Echo’s normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two for you, one for me. We need a tie-breaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Echo and stress test are more reliable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tilt-table test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Never works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bet you a week’s clinic duty it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hah hah, you’re on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You like this guy? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You always tell us our opinion of the patient is irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Medically, it’s irrelevant.  That says something about you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You figure that anybody that gives a crap about people in Africa must be full of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. There’s an evolutionary imperative why we give a crap about our family and friends. And there’s an evolutionary imperative why we don’t give a crap about anybody else. If we loved all people indiscriminately, we couldn’t function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hmmm. So, the great humanitarian’s as selfish as the rest of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just not as honest about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You also always tell us motives are irrelevant.  Dr. Charles, your heart’s handling the changes in orientation just fine. No pauses on your EKG. And House drives up for the lay-up and oh, rejected! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does this knobby thing do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m within protocol range; you’re not going to get a different result.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The way I figure it is, if this could show you problems at 6, imagine what could happen if you crank it to10. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>House, is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it go to 11?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Would you stop? You lost. I’m scheduled for clinic duty Thursday and Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content> All right, I’m beginning to feel nauseous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Would you turn the damn thing off before you break it? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Okay, I’m getting dizzy, I can’t see, I’m gonna pass out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>At those speeds, astronauts throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not talking about the nausea. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The test revealed problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah? House is insane? What he just did –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Abusive and unprofessional. If he hadn’t done it, we wouldn’t have seen the problem. You’ve got an abnormal P-R interval. It could be dangerous, possibly fatal, particularly if you’re in Africa away from advanced medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I’m going to need a pacemaker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re scheduled for surgery this afternoon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’ll be able to maintain your pacemaker from anywhere; you just need to get yourself to a phone line every few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Better yet, you could join me at one of my clinics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m kind of spoiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, we’ll get you a hut with a view. You like sand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I meant medically. No PET scans, no MRIs…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. Charles, wait –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I know, I know, hospital regulations. Darling –  – have a seat.  Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>You’re smart, you’ll adapt… we going up or down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Basement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>All right. You might even find that without the technological crutches you become a better diagnostician. My heart can handle this, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So far just carnival rides have set you off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>When you meet these people it changes you. We should talk about it over dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you asking me to Africa or on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Oh, I can ask you halfway across the world, I can’t ask you to a restaurant a block away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Well, one’s a job, and thee other’s…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah, hospital regs, you can’t date patients, right, I wouldn’t want to risk your precious objectivity. You haven’t answered either question, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don’t think objectivity’s important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I think doctors like House cling to objectivity like a three-year-old to a blanket; don’t get too worked up, stay calm, stay cool and maintain that correct perspective. The only flaw in their argument is when you have millions of people dying the correct perspective is to be yelling at the top of your lungs. Sorry, my heads killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Here, sit on the step. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>So, you gonna go out with me or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Your heart rate’s normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah, of course it is, it’s one flight of stairs. I’m going to be fine. My hand’s a little – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Call a code! Second floor stairwell! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, I have feelings. I’m trying my best. Isn’t that enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> The abnormal was real…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not sick sinus syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, thank God we found out before we put the pacemaker in. And thank God you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We were taking the stairs; they keep them in the stairwell.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is that your problem with him? You see hypocrites every day, why is this guy so special?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think I have a hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy? The problem is there are 26 letters in the alphabet and he only uses two of them. He treats thousands of patients with one diagnosis. He knows the answer going in. It’s cheating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So it’s all because he’s one of them useless specialists?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, did I hurt the big time oncologist’s itty bitty feelings?  You’re a big help to patients who actually have cancer. Other times you’re just annoying. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Wow, you just walk right in with these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s what we doctors do. We write down the name of some medicine and someone gives it to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>You know, there’s parts of the world where you get knifed walking around with this. I mean, regular stuff’s bad enough, but treatment for the resistant strain?  I could get $6 a tablet for that one. And I’d take it for two years. Streptomycin, now that’s two grand… ten grand, cure one person. I had a patient in Jani once. It was a mother, had three little boys. She had resistant TB, she couldn’t afford these. She couldn’t afford bread. We gave her the regular stuff, but no surprise she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I’m not taking these pills.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Why, because I’m better than her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because letting her die was wrong but letting you die is just as wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, maybe I won’t die. Maybe somebody will pay a little more attention to my story.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No. Palliative treatment, narcotics — Fentanyl patch, morphine drip — whatever it takes. We can make your last days fairly comfortable. And if you have another good day, maybe dinner.</content></utterance>

Take the pills or I let you die, do an autopsy, call my own press conference, and make sure the world knows that you didn’t die of TB. Corporate sponsors will be disappointed, but they’ll find another disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I’m just a mean son of a bitch. </content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we still have to explain P-R variability, syncope, headaches, and… low sugar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That was classic TB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Apparently not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’ve rerun the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Good? This is bizarre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bizarre is good! Common has hundreds of explanations. Bizarre has hardly any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What else could cause low CSF sugar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions. I’ve found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>High insulin levels in his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They’d have to be very high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay, very high insulin levels in his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How could he get high insulin levels? We’ve checked daily blood sugars, all normal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See how smart she looks? Cause she asked the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And it’s not glucagonoma because he has no rash. It’s not self-induced because he’s not an idiot, and it’s not a tumour because the CT and the MRI were both negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which just leaves the tumour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why do you do this? Why do you ignore what I say like I’m not even –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Small tumour. Really, really tiny. So small we can’t see it. Nesidioblastoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>An abnormal growth of the insulin-secreting glands of his pancreas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It only intermittently secretes insulin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It responds to stress. Like if, oh, I don’t know, if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on11.  Easily removed by surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Except, if it’s so small we can’t see it, how’re we even going to prove it’s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“She asked, looking clever.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We just start hacking away at his pancreas until he gets better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you prove something exists when you can’t see it? Does God exist? Does the wind blow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We know because the leaves move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look for effects. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uh, we should look the other way. It’s Cuddy with your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. House has an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can’t avoid her forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eventually she’ll die. You sure she doesn’t have breast cancer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We think you have a tumour, easily removed surgically. We’re going to poke it with a stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>And if there’s no tumour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing happens. Splenic artery, it’s a hard left off the celiac. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>If there is a tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What usually happens when you poke something with a stick? It pokes back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s stuck in the superior mesenteric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew we should have stopped for directions. Men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re going to inject calcium into your pancreas. The beta cells will release insulin. If there are too many beta cells because of a tumor, your blood sugar will drop precipitously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>How do we know it won’t go too low?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fingers and toes crossed. Go ahead. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Glucose is holding steady at 75.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No leaves rustling. Blow harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I already gave him 1 amp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>50. It’s starting to drop. 45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>I think my arm’s shaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m going to start him on a glucose drip. He’s going to seize</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s continuing to drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not fast enough. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s seizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ve got to reverse this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s at 40, 38, 35…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Push an amp of D-50, you want to kill the guy? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re back to 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Congratulations, you have a tumor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you going to go out with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is that any of your business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two days ago you were holding his hand. What’s changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He practically lives in Africa, there’s no future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, maybe there’s too much of a future now. You weren’t attracted to him because he was prepared to die for a cause, you were attracted to him because he was actually doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right. It’s that simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was simple?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I put a label on them and go from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everybody does it. We are who people think we are. People think he’s a great doctor so they give him stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He is a great doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The reality is irrelevant.  I’ll prove it. People who know me see me as an ass, treat me as an ass. People who don’t know me see a cripple, treat me as a cripple. What kind of selfish jerk wouldn’t take advantage of that fact? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Cecelia</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Six month supply. Should fix you right up. See you when you come back for a refill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll be back in two months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re going to give them away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Sebastian</speaker><content>Well, you know how these things happen, you leave a bag in the airplane, drop some pills down the drain…. I have an idea. You could bring me the refill in Africa.</content></utterance>
