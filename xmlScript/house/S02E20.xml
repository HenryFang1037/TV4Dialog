<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Baby Shoes</speaker><content>I can’t climb out if my hands are on my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content> Just keep ’em where I can see ’em man. Ah, ah come on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Baby Shoes</speaker><content>You high, popo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Yeah, man. Catching morons makes me high! Lift your shirt up by the collar and turn around.  Oh, would you look at that! Dude’s got a weapon.  All right. You have the, uh, right to remain stupid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Baby Shoes</speaker><content>Watch the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Baby Shoes</speaker><content>Seriously man. Careful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Seriously man? Seriously? Does your mama know what you do?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Aww, its sweet. Your dad’s proud. You made the local paper.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>With my article. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give it a rest!  You read what he wrote in the margin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s not proud of me, he’s proud of Jesus. Everything I do right is God’s work; everything I do wrong is my own damn fault. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cop with a sense of humor. Differential diagnosis.  Guy’s in the ER, bleeding on everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Good point. How about… drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tox screen was clean. He did however get hit by a bullet. Just mentioning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He was shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, somebody threw it at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m thinking trauma. He’s got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>According to Baby Shoes, the cop was laughing before he got shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Baby Shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The guy who shot him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Reliable witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His name’s Baby Shoes, how bad can he be?  The fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria. So let’s expand the search, factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because he’s in shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if the heart was already fast before he got shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You mean after the footrace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s giddy, indicates a blockage of oxygen. Carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate, cause coughing and impair neurological function. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He got CO poisoning outdoors? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, all ‘cause those bastards didn’t ratify Kyoto. Or he got CO indoors, and then moved outdoors before he’d inhaled enough to make him drop dead. Test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxyhemoglobin levels are higher then 15% stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.  You go check the cop car for gas leaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well maybe she is, but just doesn’t have as good a sense of humor. Also check his personal car, his work, home, I’ll check the precinct.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blood test confirmed you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning. We’re putting you inside a high-pressure chamber that  psssh, you don’t really care do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you live near a gas supply?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Um, yeah me…after like a huge enchilada. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Anything toxic you have at your home? Any uh, paint solvents, anything unhygienic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Uh, no. No I keep a pretty clean home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If you star having trouble breathing, you can press this button, and the chamber will decompress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not now, if you have trouble!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content> Ah, it’s broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> If you have problems we’ll push it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Ouch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Muscle contracture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How bad does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Not at, not at all!  Looks wild though huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your brain’s not getting enough oxygen; you’re losing motor function. We should start this right away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content> Should I be scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place. We have a guy there checking things out.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sounds ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Female cop</speaker><content>How about the gas intake valve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Female cop</speaker><content>It’s down in the furnace room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your system’s fine. If you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Female cop</speaker><content>Then why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was wondering if you could do me a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.  I’ve uh, I’ve got a disability. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Female cop</speaker><content>These are speeding tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A lot of emergencies.  He’s feeling better now, but you never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Female cop</speaker><content>I’ll see what we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where does your partner sit?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The place is a cesspool. But I don’t think I need to test for anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know about the marijuana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve heard rumors since junior high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The cop’s acting high because he is high. He’s got-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Legionnaires’ disease. It’s a good thing Joe got shot; the whole precinct would have gotten wiped out. Anarchy on the streets-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It takes 48 hours to test for Legionnaires’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And only 2 seconds to recognize that the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pot doesn’t explain the fact that he’s gotten worse since he was admitted. Why don’t we agree to disagree. Actually, why don’t we agree that you’ll disagree with me while treating him for Legionnaires’? It’s not as pithy, but…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>I feel a lot better. The meds are working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heart rate’s normal, COHb levels are down. No fever. Take some deep breaths. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>You seem disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well I’m glad you’re feeling better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>You got a problem with cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Please don’t talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>In my experience people who don’t just like cops have a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I need you not to talk.  No rales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>These clouded areas of the upper lobes, they’re the infiltrates we found yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Not there anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They’re clearing up. You had Legionnaires’, now you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>So you didn’t, uh, you didn’t find anything at my place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>So there’s uh, nothing I need to worry about then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not this time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What’cha doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Make sure he sees what’s involved. What we found was fairly advanced, these cloudy areas here  and here. These parts of your lungs simply weren’t functioning. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>But they’re ok now, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>Everything’s ok now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>I’m fine! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>I bumped into something. That doesn’t mean I can’t see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s frightening, but you only think you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s Dr. Cameron wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content> Dark blue pants, white shirt, black shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh! Almost, except for the pants, shirt, and shoes. You’re blind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He really thinks he can see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He can physically see. His brain just can’t process it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No chance this is a practical joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No way. Anton’s blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Must be from the trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bullet fragments just happened to hit the same spot in both lobes? Stroke could cause Anton’s blindness and euphoria. Officer Krupke is clotting in his brain. Start heparin to thin the blood. Find the clot and yank it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great! Chase, stick your fingers in there, and grope around until you find it. Oh wait! When you turn him into a vegetable then there’s gonna be frivolous lawsuits. You know what would be better? Contrast MRI. Do we have one of those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We can’t do an MRI. If the bullet fragment’s magnetic, they’ll move and rip his brain apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let’s flip a coin. Heads MRI, tails he dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Police-issued Kevlar vests don’t have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet. They would just catch it. So the bullet shattered on its own, meaning Baby Shoes was using .38 caliber hollow points, which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s just so cool that you know that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We could do an angio to find the clotting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We’ll never get a decent view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Next best thing to an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>An angio might show…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>OH GOD…it’s a coup! Fine go do your angio. When you’re done wasting your time, come meet me down in the morgue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery and up into your brain so we can check for clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Keep this on throughout the procedure, unless the pot’s already made you sterile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joe</speaker><content>I have a stressful job. You got no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I grew up with cops like you. One part bully, nine parts hypocrite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just having some fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The man is sick and scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The man is a crooked cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe you should take yourself off the case, Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don’t have to like someone to be their doctor.  Hey how you doing there buddy? Just sit still, and we’ll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.  Happy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did the angio tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I called my mom. She didn’t pick up. What did the angio tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That Foreman should be off this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s a neurologist. Unless you think the patient’s optic nerve is in his spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He doesn’t like cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Foreman, policemen are our friends. If you and I ever get separated shopping…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was just busting the guy’s chops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See! He was just busting the guy’s chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There appears to be some clotting, possibly around the Circle of Willis. Based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing. We need to cut into-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there’s a traffic jam up ahead. Is it a ten-car pileup? Or just a really slow bus in the center lane, and if it is a bus is it a thrombotic bus, or an embolic bus? Think I pushed that metaphor too far. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Angio can’t tell us that kind of information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, so you’re saying it was just a waste of time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It gave us some information without killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t know that an MRI will kill him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The bullets have a ferrous base!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They’re not going anywhere! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe it’s worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Surgeons say inoperable, and the patient’s on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You got a better plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Much!  Bullet’s identical to the one Baby Shoes popped Joe with. Let’s see how magnetic it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Attendant</speaker><content>Did anyone hear a…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I shot him! He’s dead! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only used a half-load of gunpowder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It won’t be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How unprofessional was Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ask him yourself. He’s right here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Worse than usual, better than you. He berated Joe for being a bad cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Berated or humiliated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m not sure. I didn’t have my thesaurus with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa! Whoa! You think I’m sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The fact that I’ve grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can’t even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well if I’d shot a live person, there’s a lot more paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then it won’t be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The man donated his body to science! Yes, it’s a tragedy! If I hadn’t shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first year med students use the carpool lane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do not turn that on, House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I’m doing now is taking it out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> They have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it. MRI’s gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well it doesn’t matter; we obviously can’t use it on this patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I’m sure not pulling my weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Is doing nothing an option?  I’m just saying, maybe the clot will break up on its own. The giddiness seems to have gone away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The blindness hasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Echo his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Looking for what? The problem is obviously neurological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Heart’s clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where else can we look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We could ultrasound his legs, look for a DVT. I need you to move over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tachycardia, heart rate 150 and rising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get the saline wide open!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s bleeding out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> House wanted to thin his blood, sure did a good job!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>BP’s crashing, he’s going into shock!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Intracranial bleeding. We need to relieve the pressure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need a surgical team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman, get out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Boy is he screwed! We clot his blood…he dies. We thin it…he dies!  Am I the only one to find this funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh man!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I’m not sick!</content></utterance>

If you are sick, the two of you are staying in here until we find out why. So you might want to make friends with the pig.  Good news is I can finally get my MRI.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Question you might want to ask… a neurologist. Foreman is a selfish jerk, but he’s a neurologist, and he’s the only one who’s been in that apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is why he shouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t call him a jerk if he was here. If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you’d keep it to yourself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well we’ll never know; as long as he’s not here, he’s just like any other patient. Which means we can dump on him all we want. What’s eating the selfish jerk’s brain?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Toxins are in the lead, viral’s a distant second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think the lesion could be an abscess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s just a small soft area, more mush than…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There was an increased signal there, yeah.  What’re you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Staph infection. Toxins lead to neurodegeneration, which causes the lesion.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not your fault he got sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It would be his fault if we did.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, really, who doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The mush might be forming an abscess. And since there was inflammation in the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense. The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ehh…. Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That’s why you’re wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me the bag.  Mildewed dishtowel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>To retest for staph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What is that, mouse droppings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara. Explain the blindness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now that I recognize as oven crud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could be meat with Trichinella. Would explain the high fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s with rye bread?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning which would explain the contractures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three loaves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You’re going back in there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That’s looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You on the roof yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m here. I don’t see any birds.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They came that fast because it’s their behavior pattern. Joe’s been feeding them. Now look down, you see a river of pigeon turd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uhhh... no. There’s barely any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not weird, it’s cheap. Joe’s the guy who looks for the easy way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors. Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings? You see a shovel or a dustpan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Found a scraper; it looks used. Sitting on a bucket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for Cryptococcus neoformans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness and intractable pain. Let’s hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson: don’t cut corners when you’re growing your pot. See you back home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was there. I should’ve found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah…you could’ve saved us a lot of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give me a flush of ampho B and flucytosine. I’ll start us both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was waiting for the lab confirmation, I haven’t heard from House yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look at his EEG. Beta bands have been increasing steadily since we put him under. Guy’s unconscious but still in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Beta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> One of which is pain. The fact that he’s no longer screaming makes us feel better. Not necessarily him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase! How’s Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s not giddy.</content></utterance>
</scene>



<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fever’s down. White count’s improving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Has she said anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You mean like, ‘I can plainly understand why Foreman did what he did and I hold no grudge?’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What I did, did save my life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Get in here and help, forget the suit! He’s tachycardic. Wide complex. Looks like V-tach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not Cryptococcus</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House was wrong. The samples were negative </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Give him the amio</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We have any more leads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nope. That was our lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This treatment isn’t doing anything…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s in V-fib!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No good! Hit him again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Come on man…come on, Joe</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Hit him again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Give him an amp of epi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He has multiple system failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Foreman.</content></utterance>
