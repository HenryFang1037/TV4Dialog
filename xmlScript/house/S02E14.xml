<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>And that's five. And that's six. Not bad.  On a slam contract, you normally want to play your winners early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Nah, you're learning, you're doing fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Carny Gilman's a good player. And a widow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I should take her out because she can play bridge? You're a true romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You should ask somebody out. You think Cecile's not dating yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Cecile was dating before she left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh shut up, Mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>No, I have a partner, and she's doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Amy should be out having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I'm having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, look like you're having the time of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>One, no trump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I'm just a little nauseous I umm... I think I ate too much. Can we take a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Of course. Excuse us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>What did you eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nothing weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Have you been drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Dad, you know I--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Because I don't mind if you--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dad? Dad? Dad?! What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You're scaring me, it hurts! Let go!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Henry! Henry! Let go of her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>--the occasional drink doesn't bother me but... what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content> You ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You had what's called an absence seizure. Anything like that happen to you before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>No, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He's been really healthy. He jogs, he eats right, he--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Well I did have a headache last Sunday, and for the past 2 years I've been getting acid reflux a lot and I thought that err... antacids were all I needed. Should I have come in sooner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For acid reflux and a headache? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content> You know, I hear the coffee downstairs is really good. Could you get me a cup, honey?  Would you mind closing the blinds?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His right testicle is almost twice as big as his left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's probably testicular cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The symptoms all indicate--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The shoes aren't right.  Here's how testicular cancer would manifest itself. First the patient would get the exact symptoms that he's got, then Foreman would examine him, then he'd suspect testicular cancer on the count of the symptoms being so perfect, then he'd stick a needle in it, then he'd call a surgeon. And while that guy operates, the rest of us would be out bowling. And since we're not wearing bowling shoes, the disease obviously did not progress in that fashion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>LP showed some white cells, but his MRI is clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain "clean".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What you don't trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Are you talking about the left temporal lobe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neat! You can see through my hand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's just a shadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or it's an infection. When guys have brain-crotch problems, it's usually the result of using one too much and the other too little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blood and urine were negative for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So treat him for all 3. Stat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Umm... negative means he doesn't have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, negative means he probably doesn't have it, which means he probably has cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I thought we were wearing the wrong shoes for cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma.  Except Chase's, they're just goofy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain. If it does advance he's dead no matter what we do.  So give him the STD meds, and hope the tests were wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spinook.  Who's the lucky woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I don't want to know who gets the chocolates; I want to know who you're having the affair with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Fell on his head as a child, tragic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Norwegian chocolate. Frankly, you buy that stuff the terrorists win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Some people bottle up their feelings, have them come out as physical pain. Healthy human beings express feelings such as affection by giving gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gifts express guilt. The more expensive the expression, the deeper the guilt. That's a 12 dollar box so that means you haven't slept with her yet, or she wasn't that good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not all about sex, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? When did that change?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I wanna get depo provera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Actually, at your age, as long as you're careful, the risk of you getting pregnant is pretty limited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Yeah but it would calm me down, right? If I get a high enough dose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mean calm as in... peaceful lake on a cool summer evening? Or in the lesser used meaning of nothing can ever bother you again because life has absolutely no meaning? High dose of depo provera will chemically castrate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Ok... I'm going to get up to leave now. I'm going to walk to that door, turn the handle, and then you're suddenly going to decide that you have to tell me the truth. I'm going to have to turn around and come all the way back. You see the thing is, my leg hurts. Can we cut the walking out of the equation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I love cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Any particular variety? Guernseys? Holstein?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Which are the black and white ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I pass a farm on my way to school. And they're so beautiful. They're so majestic I dream about them. Leather shoes, hamburgers. How can anybody do that to a cow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Make love, not belts. Beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>I haven't actually--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh relax; it's something we doctors deal with all the time. And I'm going to write you the name of a drug, you don't need a prescription and looks just like depo provera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>But does it do the same thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh god no. That stuff has all sorts of nasty side effects. It's real medicine. Now this is all you need, your frat buddies will be completely fooled. You tell them how appalling the doctor was, lots of laughs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We think you may have a sexually transmitted disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>No, it's not possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sir, maybe we should speak in private? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you tested him for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The tests were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Well, then it's not that. So what else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Nothing good. If you've been having sex, you HAVE to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I have not had sex since my divorce.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't ask him to take the medicine; I asked you do give him the medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He hasn't had sex in over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He knows what's at stake. We should start treating him for lymphoma right away. Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wilson! How long can you go without sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How long can you go without annoying people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No seriously, a week? A month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't say you were. Not in this conversation.  I'm talking about a patient!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>People have impulse control, we don't NEED sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well not like air, but as a biological imperative, sure we do. There's two things we get stupid for - money and sex, and since money rarely enters the bloodstream. Was his daughter in the room when you asked if he had sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I told him we could talk privately, he didn't care if she was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lunch is early huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, I'm doctor House. I hear you'd rather die than admit you had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I'm sorry I... couldn't tell my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, coz she's what? 22?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I slept with her mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She probably knows that's happened already. Roll over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>My wife had an affair, I forgave her. She had another affair and I forgave her again and... Amy thinks I was an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So smart. You must be very proud. Roll over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I assume that you've been in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that the one that makes you pants feel funny? I'm starting you on a cocktail of STD meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Amy is just getting over it. She barely spoke to her mom for months and if she thought that it was happening again and that's why I got sick...  We... we just happened to be at the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cheese is the devil's plaything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>It was just the one night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well you're obviously completely over her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Amy thinks love leads you to make stupid choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're certainly setting a good example for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>She just doesn't get it. If you're not prepared to look stupid then nothing great is ever going to happen, right? On the other hand, I guess your testicles aren't gonna explode either. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dad? Is everything ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content> I have a sexually transmitted disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How's that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He met a woman in church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Does she play bridge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content> Does she...? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Crash cart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Is this another seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Nurses</speaker><content>Coming in! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Here you go </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>40 milligrams  Knock him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How would an STD do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wouldn't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was flash pulmonary edema. We took a litre of fluid off but the problem wasn't with his lungs. It's his heart. There are vegetations obstructing his mitral valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not an STD. Lymphoma wouldn't erupt that suddenly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what is it? A disease that attacks his brain, heart and testicles. I think Byron wrote about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could be psittacosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Chlamydia cultures would have come back positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Strep viridans can hit the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wouldn't mess with the reproductive system.  Maybe things aren't so nicely connected. He's 65. We could be looking at multiple systems just starting to break down independently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way to a man's heart is through his stomach. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's had acid reflux for years. It can't be relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't need this so much.  Problem is not your lungs, it's your heart. That Italian cheese thing at the church - what sort of cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Why do you need to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm having a fondue party. Was it sheep cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Might have been. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was it soft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taste like crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Uhh... yeah. Bitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Taste like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content> Yeah. But... how did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was regular low fat American. I added some bacteria for flavour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You fed him bacteria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's pretty much on everything. Especially the unpasteurised sheep cheese they make in the Alps. That stuff will give you brucellosis. Key to a long life - exotic women, and boring cheese. I'm going to start you on rifampin and doxycycline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>Doesn't make any sense. I mean nobody else at the "church" got sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>99.9% of "Christians" have so much acid in their stomach they become churning cauldrons of death for all those nasty brucellosis bugs. But you were taking antacids for your acid reflux, so that turns your digestive tract into a pleasant scenic river for all those bacterial tourists. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You sure you're right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. Your socks don't match, which means you got out dressed in the dark, which means you don't want to wake your wife which means you don't want to talk to her, which means--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was referring to your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh that. No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How long before you get the tests back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We'll know before that. If I'm wrong, he'll just keep getting worse and slowly die. And if I'm right, either we caught it in time he gets better, or we didn't and he goes into cardiac arrest at any moment. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Paddles! Charging. 250. Clear! Charging, 300. Clear! Charging, 360. Clear! Epinephrine. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you going to tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That you suspect an affair? Sure. She already hates you, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you think that getting it off your chest will let you sleep better. It won't. You'll end up sleeping on my lumpy couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's nothing to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you playing foosball here at 8 o' clock at night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You always want to simplify everything. Boil it down to nice, easy equations, nice easy answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go home and have sex with your wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His heart is back and sinus rhythm. Has a lot of damage though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was brucellosis but we got to it too late. Vegetation broke off into his main coronary artery and caused an infarction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His heart muscle's half-dead. He'll be lucky to last a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Other than that, how's he doing?  Seriously. His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils. How's all that other stuff doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uhh his brain is clear now, and so is the genital and urinary tract and his kidney function is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's a prime candidate for transplant. Doesn't smoke. Drinks moderately. His tox screen is negative for illegal drugs, and legal ones. Surveillance blood culture show absolutely no sign of any lingering brucella bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He's 66-yrs-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told me he was 65. Liar. I'm out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content> There is an inverse correlation between patient age and success rates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's in excellent health. This was his first hospitalisation since breaking his leg at 23. Or 22, I'm not sure anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>If this patient were to survive the operation, he'd get another what? 5, 10, maybe 20 years if he's very lucky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're saying that old people aren't as worth saving as young people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He's saying that hearts are a scarce resource. We obviously have to choose criteria--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No I get it; women live longer so they should get preference, right? The African-Americans, they die a lot younger so to hell with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>What you think you're going to win me over by calling me a racist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the test is who gets to use it the longest, you can either be a racist or a hypocrite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>Your patient had a life. A family. We've got 18-yr-old kids who only--</content></utterance>

This is what she wanted; she wanted her organs to help another--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>My point is, even if it's not Hep C, it's something. They turned it down as a donor because if we put that heart into someone, they won't survive. Whatever made her sick will kill him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>MWAHAHAHAHA. Doubt it. Just want to get the infection out of her heart before we get the heart out of her. The fever indicates an infection.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's assume, just for fun, that the answer is something that might be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fever and belly pain. Could be a gall bladder infection.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The amebias started in her liver and spread to her blood, that would explain all her symptoms. Except for the crushed skull but I'm assuming that's from the car crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll start her on paromycin and chloroquine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> 10 grams each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's... 20 times the normal dose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. So we'll destroy her retinas and damage her hearing. Whoever wants those parts is having a very bad day. Couple of hours on the meds and she'll be feeling great.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely nothing. Blood work is perfect. You got lots of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of proteins. Including a little something I like to call 'bovine serum albumin' which you get from eating the animals mentioned. Or cow. You don't really worship cows. So I have to wonder, what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Quite the insight. She lied to you about her hair colour, and didn't want you to know she thought she was fat. Unless you never lied to her about anything that huge, I think you can probably let those slide.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That was kind of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't want him going postal on us. Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands, you can tell him about the gonorrhea.  He's gotta be tested. Preferably before he gets any sympathy sex.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Donald</speaker><content>For the last err... year, or so... Laura was kind of distant with me. I don't know why.  I thought... maybe she was having an affair, but not Laura.  And I'm not excusing myself, but I was travelling during Christmas, I had a... I had a one-night-stand. I got gonorrhea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Donald</speaker><content>Yup. I should have said something to you. But I didn't want to believe that I gave it to her. That's what made her sick and... that... was why she got into the accident. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She told me.  Things have been crappy at home lately, I figured I wasn't spending enough time with her. I figured...  Turns out you're right, it's always about sex. She's been having an affair.</content></utterance>
