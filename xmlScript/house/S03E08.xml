<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Heart attack. His cath was clean and echo showed no functional abnormalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Fatigue, night sweats, weight loss preceded the heart attack. Eighteen-year-old kid. Suddenly an orphan _and_ a single father of two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Party of five! Powerful stuff. The OC of its day. Stress explains everything except the itchy feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Athlete's foot covers that. Waiters work twelve hours a day in old sneakers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm. Good idea. Ignore the symptoms. Makes your job easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> I'm not ignoring the symptom. I'm explaining a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Kid's been hanging over a toilet despite anti-emetic therapy. Persistent vomiting could indicate increased intra-cranial pressure, tumour...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sure. Heart problems, gotta be the brain. Thank God there's a neurologist in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Right. It's the feet. If only I was a podiatrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Probably got an intestinal virus from one of those feral kids running around. Repeated vomiting causes an electrolyte imbalance which leads to an arrhythmia, which leads to the heart attack...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Apparently you can't. Now what's a game without rules? Uhh, no tagbacks, no biting, you get one test each and the clock runs until lunch.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content> You're a person-of-interest in a narcotics investigation. You're linked to their suspect and his activities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> I'm not Pablo Escobar's evil henchman cruising into Miami in a cigarette boat. I'm a physician who prescribed Vicodin to a pain patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content> This police report you faxed me, says they found six hundred pills in his apartment. You prescribe those?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What, are we like role-playing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content> Yeah. And you suck at it. Which is really unfortunate, because you're pretending to be you. I gotta get to court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Michael told me you could help me get my car back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>Yeah... divorce lawyers usually know the ins and outs of drug enforcement. You want your car back? You're gonna have to give the cops what they want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Thanks. Usually people feel helpless in these situations.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Patient history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He's eighteen. Probably drinks, smokes, does drugs. How close am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Quit drugs when his parents died. Quit smoking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>House didn't mock my viral idea. He just said it was wrong. Which means he didn't want to give reasons, which means I must have been close.  I'm thinking bacteria. I'm doing a blood culture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I am doing an MRI.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Not telling.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>Uhm... is that important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I don't know.  Is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What kinda drugs you into?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> You don't have to talk about that right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> No, that's okay. I don't keep secrets from them. They know I did drugs before our parents died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Clever. Admit the past. Deny the present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>I'm clean. I'm raising two kids. It'd be pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But confiding it in eight-year-olds is okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>If I'm open with them, then they'll be open with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Shyeah! Turning the other cheek's a good strategy in boxing. Kids don't lie because they have trust issues. They lie because they have something to hide.  Look at him. Sitting there doing nothing. He's still lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>WILL</speaker><content>We don't lie to Jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Spelling test you failed or forgot to...?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>WILL</speaker><content>He doesn't sit next to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The other one's probably having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>KAMA</speaker><content>I am not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yet. But when you start, you're gonna lie about it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Colder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> I'm not playing.  Keep very still, Jack. This won't take long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> How much dope did you smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>Does he have to be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> No. Ignore him.  'S not his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Never said it was.  What about cigarettes? How'd you quit? Gum? Patch? Hypnosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> He went from two packs to nothing. Cold turkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Or we could just make small talk. You still seeing that nurse in Paeds? I just don't think she's right for you. You need someone detached, calculating, ambitious. You need yourself in a skirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Jack, he asked you a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>I didn't really quit. Just sorta lost taste for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm. Interesting. Sounds like one of those symptom thingies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He's still puking and he had a heart attack aaand... itchy feet! It's not his lungs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>If the problems are at my heart, why did that other doctor look at my brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah.  Why did that other doctor look at his brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> We're just trying to eliminate as many possibilities as we can. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So because you think a spasm causes heart attacks, you're gonna induce another spasm?  Did you consent to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Everything's under control. Tests are gonna identify which arteries are affected so we can repair them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Your meds don't seem to be doing anything. So either you're wrong... or his system hasn't been pushed enough to set anything off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You wanna get back home, right? I mean, you're probably already falling behind with the housework, bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> How many sick days you think you'll get before they replace you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Heart rate's up. Nothing else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>They can't fire me if I'm sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Right! You're irreplaceable. Who else would they find qualified to dance with a rodent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> How can you even support your family? What happens when those kids grow out of their clothes, when they get sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Still no spasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> They'll take those kids away from you, Jack. Maybe I should bring them in here right now so that you can kiss them... goodbye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Can't you see his heart is fine?! Stop torturing him! What kind of doctor are you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Where's your car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It's a hostage! Tritter wants me to testify against House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You're not going to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Is that a question or an order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Any sort of conviction will cost House his license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Which will cost this hospital. Relax. I'm not gonna mess with your precious resource. I told my lawyer to tell Tritter to go to hell. Marko!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Why are all my prescriptions getting bounced back?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>MARKO</speaker><content>Sorry, Dr. Wilson. I was trying to call you. Where's your phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>In my car. My patients, on the other hand, are here and need their medications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>MARKO</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I can't.  Your DEA number's been suspended.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ohh! That was suspenseful for about two seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Blood culture was negative for bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Positive for Hepatitis A?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Hmm! I wonder who could've ordered that extra test? Must be somebody who knew what persistent vomiting, sudden distaste for nicotine and itchy feet have in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Hep-A doesn't explain the heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, but as Chase so deftly pointed out earlier, puking does. And Hep-A explains the puking. If this had been real-life, instead of just games...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>The DEA just revoked my prescription privileges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But who's gonna prescribe my Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Yes, well, that's why I'm here. This is a disaster for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Relax. Tritter's just getting desperate. He's got no real evidence. He's trying to squeeze you into ratting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I'm not gonna let him squeeze my patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>They'll be fine. Also your cancer medicine sucks anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I'm gonna use your team to do my prescribing till this is straightened out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Suddenly this doesn't seem nearly as dramatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Go pump IVIG into the kid. Cure him and get him out of here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>They were abscesses from a fungal infection. Aspergillis. But we still have no idea why.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>It can't be genetic. He would've been getting infections since he was an infant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not if he grew up in a bubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Or if he grew up on Mars. No germs there either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I don't mean a literal bubble. A sweet, suburban bubble, where the mommies and daddies protect their children. They die, bubble bursts. Continuing emotional trauma triggers a genetic illness. Question is: which one?  The infections he's contracted narrowed down the possibilities.  Hep-A indicates a problem with his B-cells.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> What does it tell us?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> It could mean Chronic Granulomatous Disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>The Aspergillis is a T-cell issue. Common Variable Immunodeficiency. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Each of the possible four genetic conditions is most susceptible to different types of infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>This is a cocktail of serratia, meningococcis, cepacia and rhinovirus. Whichever germ gains the most ground, plants the flag with its leader, gives us our answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>And how are you gonna know which one gains the most ground?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Now that's the fun part. See if the meningococcis is King of the Hill, you get to have another seizure. Serratia will shut down your lungs. If it's cepacia, you'll have a heart attack. If it's the rhinovirus,... you'll sneeze.  Can't all be dramatic. We good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> Hell no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Only alternative is we guess. And there's a three-out-of-four chance that your little brother and sister will get to cry over another coffin.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>They're children, they need a guardian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He couldn't find a baby-sitter. On account of not being able to make any phone calls on account of not being able to breathe on account of his lungs filling up with serratia. He has Chronic Granulomatosis Disease. Game over. My work is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Then he's gonna keep getting sick. You gotta call Social Services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Bone marrow transplant would reboot his whole immune-system. He'll be healthy enough to win Miserable-Daddy-of-the-Year.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>To the testing. What about the surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The risk for Will? 'S next to nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> What if I don't do it? What are my other options?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're immune-system can't fight off the germs we all come into contact with everyday. Now that we know, we can use more targeted medications. But you'll still get sick all the time. You'll be in and out of hospitals...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>But I'll live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Jack, your life-span will be substantially shortened. And you'll be too sick to care for your brother and sister anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>You shouldn't have pressured him into doing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>There's no pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>He's eight years old! You tell him his brother's dying, unless he helps. What do you think he's gonna say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He wants to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>He has no idea. It's like you asked him to let me play with one of his toys. This is surgery. He could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He'll be fine. But you...  You're gonna have a hard time protecting him like this if you're dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> I'll do it...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Why can't you accept he wants to protect his brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>_Has_ to protect his brother. Doesn't want to. Wants to run screaming from protecting his brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> You're a hypocrite.  "Evidence is everything. Truth is all that matters."  Except when it comes to people. Everything we've learned about this kid says you're wrong,  but you can't accept that. It's easy to reject the diagnosis. Not so easy to reject your misanthropy. Because then you'd have to give people a fighting chance. And that... scares the crap out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay.  Let's get some evidence.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's your lucky day! I just found another donor in the registry. Perfect match. We can do the transplant, no danger to the rugrat.  Just have to sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Unless there's another reason you don't want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>There's a chance I'd die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Chance you'd be cured. Maybe you don't want that either. Maybe hanging out in a hospital, getting waited on hand and foot reminds you what life used to be like before you were forced to play Mr. Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>I don't like being sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But you don't like being healthy either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>This is your way out. Guilt-free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>I said I'd do it when Will's eighteen.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> I can't just ask my patients to wait because Dr. Cameron's boss won't let her come out and play!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Kept you waiting for maybe an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Three hours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Anybody die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Not this time!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Oh, so now's a better time for me to have my life taken away if it fits into your schedule better?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>YES!! YES! Do something! Go in! Show some remorse! Tell Tritter you'll get some help!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> House, get out of here. Get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're not gonna make _me_ feel guilty about what Tritter is doing... to us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> You already feel guilty. Your serious shoulder pain... isn't coming from your cane, it's coming from your conscience. And that used to be enough. Despite all your smart-ass remarks, I knew you gave a damn. This time,  you were either gonna help me through this or you weren't. I got my answer.</content></utterance>

You're gonna know you screwed up. You'll take his bone marrow and you'll take 'em back.  They'll be a burden and a pain, and your life will never be what it was supposed to be.But you'll be proud of yourself. Your parents  gonna be proud of you.</content></utterance>
