<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Two boxes of grenades in there. It's our only chance at getting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Roy</speaker><content>Uh, Vince, that place is a death trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Lucky for you, I’ve got the mega-blaster. Lee, you go right. Roy, straight down the middle. I'll cover you both.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Roy</speaker><content> That blood look funny to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Still working on it. The code's a little janky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Hey, boss, you just like watching us get our asses shredded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Roy</speaker><content>Yeah, not that you're not hilarious, but we hit the shelves in three months.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Your NCV test was normal. Rules out carpal tunnel. No evidence of trauma. Your blood work looks normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Then what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't know. I'll arrange to have you transferred to a neurologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>A neurologist? Don't you have some famous diagnostics guy? What's he doing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You can't quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you're confusing me with Jake Gyllenhaal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, and I want to stay that way. Talked it over with my therapist. I need to change my environment, my habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But he cleared you to get your license back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which will help immensely with my new job in research. I’ve sent out some resumes. Research means no patients, less pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you just got out. Have you had enough time to think this through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I know this will affect both of you... And Thirteen... And the one with the nose. I just can't risk coming back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> That was surprising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I want to run the department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You consider waiting until House clears the lobby before you start angling for his job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's not dead or sentimental and somebody needs to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not necessarily. Departments of diagnostic medicine don't exist. The only reason we have one is because of House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You reassigned us, kept us on payroll for three months. You might as well give me a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're a great doctor. I want you to stay on in neuro. But House was a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House was an egotistical, pill-popping lawsuit magnet... And a genius. And I worked with him longer than anybody else. I can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You get one shot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What's House gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No idea, but he's gone. So how about we focus on the medicine?  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You’re the boss. It's kind of sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Here I thought it was just the pants. Uh, diabetic neuropathy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hba1c looks fine. Could be hypothyroidism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No fatigue or weight gain. What about complex regional pain syndrome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let's run with it. Look at that. No House, the job still gets done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And yet something's missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I’m short. He's black. You're gay-ish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Treat for CRPS. Prep the patient for spinal stimulation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I don't buy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>CRPS isn't that well understood, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I think it's mercury poisoning. I eat a ton of sushi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And you're currently getting mixed reviews in “Speed-the-Plow” on Broadway.  Google it. It's pretty hard to consume enough fish to give yourself mercury poisoning, and it doesn't usually present solely with pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>But it can. Check out the “Atlantic Medical Journal”. This guy came in with burning pain caused by, uh, "erythromelalgia", caused by mercury poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Who needs actual doctors when you got the internet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>No offense, but doctors make mistakes. Medical errors are up 30% this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You should check the rate of patient error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>There's a ton of information out there. Why wouldn't I educate myself, be my own advocate? CRPS came up in my search too. But I’ve never had any skin discoloration, and my pain is sporadic and not constant. It's got to be worth one lousy blood test.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You know how House feels about people touching his ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. Chase refuses to tell me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right. My husband's gay. Witty. I hear you're taking over for House. You're gonna be great. Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not permanent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Camreon</speaker><content>Yet. Taub and Thirteen cool with it? He's older than you. She's seen you naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not like we haven't been working together for two years now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Working with is different than working for.  You saw House. How was he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He was... Good. He was honest, took responsibility. It was kind of weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uh, is Thirteen around? I need her to sign off on her ER transfer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She and Taub are doing a spinal stimulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, they're not. I just dropped a patient in the cath suite, and your guys were not in there. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know, usually spinal stimulation is done with the patient in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He asked us to test his blood for mercury. It's unlikely, but not impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s also not what we agreed on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Testing doesn't hurt. It only takes 20 minutes. I figured it didn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m thinking I should decide when it matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When you're done marking your territory... Test results. Surprise, surprise. Marcus Webly was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I'll handle this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know it's the right call. Just don't know what to do with my time. And my leg –  Pain's flared up since I left Mayfield. Ibuprofen’s barely putting a dent in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. Doctors the world over treat chronic pain with collections of Hummel figurines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You already made me get a roommate. Wilson's got one bedroom. I don't think we can get any more connected without unzipping.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Vince, I’m Dr. Foreman, head of diagnostics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>So you must be the genius' replacement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I prefer to think of myself as genius 2.0. Your blood tests ruled out mercury poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>What was my mercury level?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>2.8. That means for every deciliter of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I know what it means. I also know it's above normal. I want mercury chelation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your level isn't elevated enough to produce your symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>You can't know that until we de-elevate it and see if my pain improves. It’s a judgment call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Based on ten years of medical training? I think you have CRPS. I want to try spinal stimulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>So, basically, you want to shove a needle in my spine based on a glorified hunch. I'll stick with the chelation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you don't want to get better, I think we're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>What do you mean "done"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not interested in my medical opinion. I’ll move on to my next patient. You'll move on to a doctor willing to run all the unnecessary tests and procedures you want. Or you can stick around and be cured. Makes no difference to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I’m glad you changed your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Don’t know about that. Dr. Foreman basically strong-armed me, which is impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Stimulating at 100 hertz. Guess you found him a little more persuasive than two of us – Probably the pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>He reminds me of me.  Is it supposed to hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not if we're in correctly. Is it your hands? Your back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content> No, my chest. Can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Heart rate's 140, climbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You need to hold still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Deep breaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His lungs are filling with fluid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Analysis of the fluid from Vince’s lungs shows the lung problem is really a heart problem. He's got a thickened left ventricle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When his heart sped up during the procedure, it jacked up the pressure in his lungs, causing pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Good thing I talked the patient into spinal stimulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It did lead us to discovering a new symptom and proved he was wrong about mercury poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We lucked into that discovery, and we were wrong about CRPS. Ventricular thickening plus neuropathy could equal Lyme disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not without joint pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When is his new game coming out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Couple months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s probably working nonstop. Might be using more than coffee to power through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cocaine use explains the symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> So we search his office for drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. We're gonna ask him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cooking Teacher</speaker><content>In a lot of ways, cooking is like music. Different elements combine to make a symphony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Difference is that Beethoven’s 5th isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What was my one condition for allowing you to tag along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try not to be a jerk. I'm trying. I’m just failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Roll your meatballs and keep an open mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How hard are you trying not to make a ball joke right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They're smoking.  Your balls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Ow. No, no. They're browning way too fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Blue is the color you got to watch out for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Enough. My God, they're – they're still raw inside. By the time they're cooked through, the outside will be burned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think there's a medicated powder for that. Although, vinegar could work.  My o-chem prof talked about how, theoretically, you shouldn't trust the results of a hemoglobin a1c test on a chronically acidotic patient. The acid in the blood slows the reaction between the hemoglobin protein and blood sugar. Browning meat is the same chemical process, which means, it should also be slowed by acid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That actually makes sense. You might've... saved my balls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That's the spirit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Obviously, the procedure didn't go as planned. The heart problem was unforeseeable, but I still feel responsible. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Okay. How long you guys been doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think it's best if we kept things professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Tough to do now that I’ve seen you rock a leopard-print bikini. Congrats, by the way.  Up top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You hacked my profile page?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Your treatment nearly gave me a heart attack. Figured I’d check if you had the credentials to go with the cojones. One search led to another. Is there a shot of just her? I’m thinking screen saver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> We need to know if you've been using cocaine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Nope. Dude, you just block everybody, or do you really only have three friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need you to be straight with us. We need to be able to trust you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I cleaned up my act 12 years ago... After my college roommate ODed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Search his office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You think he was lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, but I’m not sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It was worth asking. If he'd had said yes, it would've saved us a trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But he didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You have to forget about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>House. First, you try acting like him. That doesn't work. So then you try the opposite. Now you're mad because you have to use his move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I feel like Tom Brady’s backup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Tom Brady’s backup now makes 10 million dollars. Stop comparing. You can do this by being you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We should still check out his office, talk to his coworkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'll get Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And... Thanks. Oh, and dinner tonight at 7:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Can we make it 8:00?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Already made a reservation for 7:00.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> MISSIONARY</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You bake the potatoes instead of boiling them, it's less moisture, fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Feeling better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s fine, as long as I’m not the reason for it. I know that sounds completely narcissistic, but =</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. But it's not. We flirted. We kissed. I fondled. I hallucinated a night with you and yelled it from a hospital balcony. You're not a narcissist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So what am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the reason I’m leaving.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not trying to avoid my boyfriend. I'm a lizard, not an idiot. You've been in a crappy mood since we got in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And you're completely okay with being ordered around by someone who 24 hours ago was basically your equal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Unlike you, I didn't expect anything different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The work part, I can get used to. He didn't ask me to go to dinner. He told me we were going. He's never done that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So even the score. Go home tonight, put on some heels, and break him like a pony. You'll feel much better.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Wow, that's one big-ass bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> It's kind of amazing. The way the wings move, it's so real.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's also a good way to contract an infection called psittacosis. We spoke to Dr. Foreman. He wants to start you on antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Does that infection cause problems in the... joystick area? I’m kind of stuck in play mode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes, we get it. She’s very, very pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>It's not her. I mean, it was... When she was here with her boyfriend three hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You've had an erection for three hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>At first, it was just embarrassing, but now it's really starting to hurt. Will the antibiotics help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm afraid not. This isn't psittacosis.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His erection persisted even with medication. We had to put in a surgical shunt just to drain the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You missed dinner. And a shunt doesn't require both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm dedicated. So the Holy Trinity: heart, hands, hose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be Guillain Barre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not with normal nerve conduction. Thrombocytosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His platelet count isn't that high. Brain tumor makes more sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I'm sorry. I just realized... Joint pain and joint pain. Honest, I wasn't laughing because of the obvious tension between the two of you. Erection points to a circulatory problem. I'm with Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It is possible for a brain tumor to cause –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're going with thrombocytosis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It felt like an order. Your tone of voice was—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>My tone? I'm under a little pressure right now. How about giving me a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Look, this is tough for both of us, except I haven't just gotten a promotion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So now you're jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. I’m just saying don't complain about the burdens of command to your employees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was complaining to my girlfriend.  Who are those guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Meet the competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You called another doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Lots of other doctors. Posted my symptoms on the internet. You guys are 0 for 2. I thought I’d look for some backup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Okay, that guy's an idiot. That doesn't mean they all are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Neither one of you have privileges at this hospital. Please leave... Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>'Cause he doesn't need one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We considered that and concluded thrombocytosis is more likely. I'm starting him on hydroxyurea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are no signs of increased ICP. I’m not delaying treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>Looks like we need a tiebreaker. Dr. Hadley, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think both theories have merit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>So, brain tumor, otherwise you'd back your boss/boyfriend. I want an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll set it up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. You're up. I need a taster. Ragout with pork sausage, beef thigh, no cream. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's a little early.  Did you even go to bed last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bed is for sissies, unless you're having sex, in which case... No, bed is still for sissies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Doesn't this seem a little bit obsessive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Should've been here when I was butchering the ox. What do you expect? I’m an addict. I turn everything up to eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. I thought you were trying to tone that down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I was trying to find something I could set at eleven without blowing out my eardrums.  Star anise with caramelized onions. The sulfur compounds bring out the meat flavor.  I couldn't sleep because of my leg. It was either make ragout or go out on the street looking to score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Good choice. So, so good. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He asked me a question. I answered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You told me to make my own decisions. I do, and you stab me in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I didn't even say what I really thought. I hedged, and I don't like that I hedged. If I have a legitimate opinion –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Express it in private. In public, the team opinion is your opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Except the team opinion is your opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And what's mine, to lie when I’m asked a direct question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You would've done it for House. Maybe you just don't want me to succeed. Maybe you just want to kick me again for not asking you to dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>At least when House was being an unbelievable jerk, I could talk to my boyfriend about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I may be a jerk, but you're wrong. MRI is clean. Treat for thrombocytosis. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew you'd show up here complaining about Foreman. Thought you'd hold out for another week at least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I showed up to ask if you've seen thrombocytosis with a platelet count under –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I went crazy, not stupid. I leave, Foreman embraces his inner mugabe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Embryonali – unhatched chicken egg.  I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk and replace it with ragout. By the way, you can tell the other lepers that their absence has been noted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cameron didn't come by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Daddy's little co-dependent is all grown up. Making room for daddy's hot bisexual with boyfriend problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's not a problem. It’s, um... Okay. It’s a problem. I mean, I get it, the patient's a nightmare. He posted his case online. It – you know Foreman. You know the situation. How can I get him to tone it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop being a coward for one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's the one who's afraid of failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At a job that no one before me has ever done. His fears are justified. You're just afraid of giving him control over you, which might work at home. It makes it almost impossible for him to do his job. Pass me those crackers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You're saying this is all my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm saying... That you would be happier if you learned when it's okay to give in.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You just suggested that I give in so that I can be happy. What did they do to you in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taste this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Um, good. This might be the best thing I’ve ever eaten. And, yes, I’m including what you're thinking of now. You are an amazing cook!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not being a wuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chaes</speaker><content>Challenging you is part of her job. But when she does it, you take it personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you're saying this is my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was trying to bury it a little, but, yeah. You’ve got to eliminate either the challenge or the reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or, we could stick with my original plan. We get drunk and talk about how girls are lame.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That nothing's gonna help. That I end up in the very dark place. I'm fine... Just not happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if nothing works? What if nothing gives me more than a few days before my brain starts looking for the next fix, before my leg feels like someone's shoving nails into it? What do I do then?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Nope. Thyroid levels are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want us to spend the next few days shooting down every theory in the world, or can we do our jobs and come up with one that works?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I want you to test me for amyloidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That your professional opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>It's the wisdom of crowds. Studies show the collective decision of a group can be more accurate than any individual's decision. I went through my emails. Amyloidosis got the most votes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you had amyloidosis, there'd be speckling on your cardiac ultrasound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>In 100% of cases?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine. I'll make you a deal. We'll do a kidney biopsy to test for amyloidosis. When it comes back negative, you pull your case off of the internet and retract the reward. It's either that, or I don't test you at all.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the lab says that this is retriever too, please let me know right away. It'd explain my overwhelming desire to wipe my butt on your carpet.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stop the chemo. He's got Fabry's disease. He was in the tub for an hour. His fingers should have pruned, but they didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Already stopped chemo and confirmed Fabry’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Vince</speaker><content>I’m glad you both agree, but could somebody loop me in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We assumed the deposits in your kidneys were proteins, but they were fats. Fabry’s makes them build up in your organs, choke your nerves, keep your fingers from pruning in water. It's chronic but manageable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> How'd you figure it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Iodine mumps. His lymph nodes swelled up after the head CT. We thought it was a new symptom, but it wasn't. It was a reaction to the contrast. Iodine mumps takes lymph nodes off the table. Remove that symptom...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And that just came to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I looked through the online responses again. Someone posted it this morning.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Heard Cuddy made it official. Department’s yours. Congrats. I'm sorry. I went behind your back. On a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A 7. And that's stupid. You did the right thing. It's my fault you thought you had to go behind my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I should've stood up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But you didn't 'cause you didn't want to fight again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> It's our first case. It’ll take time to adjust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What if by the time we get adjusted, we don't like each other anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You sure? 'Cause ever since I took this job, we've been making each other miserable. I really don't think this is gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're breaking up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. The other night when I thought I was done, you were there. I need you. I don't want to lose you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why are you...? You're firing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I solved my old team's case. I was about to take the pills. I went online. I found people posting medical problems, and... My leg stopped hurting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh? I'm supposed to be changing my life. This is not a change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Says the guy making sand castles in my brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're okay with me going online, solving cases?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The hospital is part of my old life. If I go back, I might become... who I was before, pills and all.</content></utterance>
