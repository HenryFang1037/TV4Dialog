<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>4:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Why so late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Make-up test in social studies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Did you invite Shelby for Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Do you want me to call her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Yeah, that'd be great. You calling a 12-year-old girl for a sleepover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>It'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Make you a deal. I'll call a friend when you call a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>It's your birthday. Do what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Thank you. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>What did you forget?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Then why'd you come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>'Cause I live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Come on, Samantha, you're gonna be late for school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>What are you talking about? It's 4:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I, uh… Tired, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Great. That's all I need to know.  You're late!  Okay, bye.  37-year-old male with recurring blackouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell him to switch from tequila to bourbon. Worked for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The three doctors he's already seen already ruled out drugs and alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then it's epilepsy. Tell him to buy a hockey helmet —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>EEG's clean. So is the CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. Just because you got approved by an adoption agency doesn't mean you'll get approved by the birth mother. You're a single mom. That puts you somewhere below couples acquitted in day care scandals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're welcome, Dr. House. It is an interesting case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What time are you seeing the mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Are you having your guy follow me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just trashed your social value as a mother, and all I got was a little sarcasm. It means you don't feel the need to defend yourself, which means you're not worried about getting a kid, which means you've already got one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We're meeting at 11:00. She's due to deliver a baby girl in two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure the mom'll be thrilled to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's not a crack baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, mother's perfectly healthy. She just had to give up the baby in order to continue her work on the human genome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She confessed to some past meth use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What they don't confess to is almost always more interesting. This is a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because a kid you don't know may have some problems you don't know about that she may have passed on to a kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you're a control seeking narcissist. Which is fine, good even, in some jobs. But you're not equipped to handle a real kid, never mind a factory second. Where are you meeting her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>In a little place called "follow me and your urologist will be buying himself a new yacht."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They explained the returns policy, right? It's worse than video games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not changing my mind. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be post concussion syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not without a pre-concussion. Pick a number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy pool. She got the nod. Little tweaker's due in 14 days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's great news… I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's good news. The great news is she insisted that she's not gonna change her mind, which means she's actually thought about changing her mind, which means she's not sure she's ready to be a mom, which means she's not ready to be a mom, which means she's gonna change her mind. The only question is when. $100 buy in. Less than seven means the next seven days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But she's been dying for a kid for three years. No way she's gonna back out now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not one of the options.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mini strokes can cause blackouts and memory loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Nine hours is a lot of time to be out for a mini stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And there'd be residual damage on the CT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Guy works at home as a consumer product tester. He could've been exposed to a toxin that caused short-term memory loss. Wouldn't show up on imaging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cavernous sinus thrombosis could cause absence seizures and memory loss. I'll take 7 to 14.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have a player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You just said it was great news. Now you want to bet against her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's only great news if she wants it to be great news. House knows her better than any of us.  I'd rather use a pseudonym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good thinking. I say she's gonna meet the mom and bolt. I'm going for the early fold.  Check his home for toxins and his sinuses for thrombosises.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe he ODed on caffeine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Apparently he didn't drink the coffee, just smelled it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wow. Did they just move here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Six years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is no way to raise a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's a single dad. I'm sure he's doing his best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which is why single people shouldn't have kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You got a problem with what Cuddy's doing? You think single mothers can't —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think the traditional family is a fraud. Even married moms are single moms. Daddy just pays some bills and reads just enough bedtime stories to not kill himself out of guilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>My dad was great. After my mom died —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He might be the exception. On the other hand, you are fairly screwed up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No booze, no meds, no drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> And no view. Building's half-empty. He'd rather have a view of the turnpike than the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Park views are probably 50% more. You're the surprised the guy's a pragmatist after looking at this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Guy's not a pragmatist. He's a flagellant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ump. Looks like mold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mom would've cleaned better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Exposure to certain types of mold can cause short-term memory loss. We're testing both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>I feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sure you are. We're just being cautious. So where do you guys go other than home and school? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Nowhere. Dad works at home, and I go to school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What about sports, friends, travel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Like I said, dad works at home, and I go to school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Must be hard not having your mom around, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>I was only four when the accident happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Still, I'm sure you both miss her sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>No, I just don't get what the big deal about death is, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Physically, she's fine. Mentally, she's weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sure she's just freaked out about her dad.  Mr. Harmon?  Mr. Harmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I have an appointment. I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We haven't finished with your treatment. We're still waiting on some test results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I have an appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sorry, you're gonna have to reschedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>I really have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Mr. Harmon, do you know where you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Why are you trying to stop me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Look at his eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is he having a seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His pupils are responsive. I think he's… asleep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was just asleep. Means no memory loss. And sleepwalking doesn't kill. Unless he walks out a window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sleepwalking's not a diagnosis. It's a symptom. As long as we can't figure out why —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Stress-induced insomnia. Lots of people sleepwalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not in the middle of the day before they've even put their head on a pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could be some sort of narcolepsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which is caused by…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There's usually genetic history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If you know the answer, can you tell us the answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know the answer. Which brings us back to — or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Some sort of environmental trigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Being lead down an annoying path.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I honestly don't know where this is going. Just following the clues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're right back where we started. The mold we found doesn't cause these symptoms. And there's nothing else at his home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And you're obnoxious. He never goes anywhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which we know because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because he says so. Because his daughter says so. Because they have no reason to lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which proves he never goes anywhere else…  when…  he's… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Conscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He said he had an appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next time, let him keep it. Send him home. See where his dreams take him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Becca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Lisa. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Oh, you want one? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>I can't stop eating them. I guess it's, like, a craving. I must have, like, a dozen a day. Oh, and this is decaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How have you been feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Oh, you know, tired, fat, nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is there, um, anything you want to ask me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, actually, I just have one question. Um, what are you gonna call her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ah, I'm not sure. It's all been rather sudden, you know? I like Joy. But as I said, I haven't really decided yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Well, is there anything you want to ask me? It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The agency web site is filled with prospective parents. Their photos, their biographies. There's so many wonderful people out there. Wonderful couples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Why did I choose a single mom? My grandmother was married for 37 years to a man that treated her like garbage. And my mom would've stayed married to my loser dad that long, but he dumped her. You know, I never understood how you could fall for the same crap as your mother. Then I met Tony.  When I read your bio, a doctor, a head of a hospital, I saw your picture… I don't want her raised by a loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> How long have you had that rash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>I don't know. A few days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Have you had any joint pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm pregnant. All my joints hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They shouldn't all hurt. Have you been using?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Not in seven months. Not since I found out I was pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That needs to be checked out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You sure you don't want children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You know, just because we're stuck here and I'm lying down doesn't mean we need to get deep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're afraid you'll make the same mistake you made with your wife. Get caught taking some other kid to a ball game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I like my life as it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Alpha waves increasing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Any change in demeanor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, nothing. He just got up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Maybe it's a result of the blood pressure change. Delta waves, out of nowhere. He's now asleep. Brain's supposed to turn off motor function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If the brain was doing what it was supposed to be doing, we wouldn't be here. He's leaving. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's 38 weeks. You think it's fifth disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's a viral infection. It can infect the fetus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Usually in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and in women who have trouble with their immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>History of drug use could've compromised her immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>I told you I haven't used anything in seven months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It does look more like a heat rash to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, well, maybe we want to look at the actual blood tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Of course. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>She works for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Everybody here works for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> When this happens for real, are you okay to deliver here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Blood work's normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Test it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Tested it twice.  I'll get you some topical cream for that rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm admitting her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's nothing wrong with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There are dozens of other things this rash could indicate. I want a full fetal work up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're losing it. That's what happens when you have kids. Ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears. It's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She had a lace pattern rash, joint pain, and a history of drug abuse. You would've done exactly the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh-huh. And I'd be an excellent father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hey! What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Baby barf. Maternity ward was handing out free samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Well played, sir. You leave me no choice but to change. My clothes, not my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's exactly my point. It's not gonna be me and a cup. It's gonna be eight times a day. If you can't handle wearing that stain, you can't handle a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why do you even care? It's not like I'm ever gonna ask you to babysit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a humanitarian.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We should stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The whole point was to —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let him plow into some innocent bystander?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His legs are working. Obviously, his eyes are working too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His reaction time could be slower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's stopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, I see.  He's having sleep sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe. Pull up to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What'd that guy want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sadie</speaker><content>Piss off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Go after him. She's not a hooker.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Coke explains the narcolepsy. Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But it doesn't explain the rip in the space-time continuum. Coke leads to sleepwalking, which leads to coke, which leads to sleepwalking. What caused the first sleepwalking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The coke he took while he was wide-awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Says he didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Wouldn't be the first time somebody lied about drug use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He has no reason to lie. He knows he's sick. His job doesn't drug test. No relationship. His daughter wouldn't find out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Forgot he did cocaine? You're going with forgot over lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fits. Cocaine explains the narcolepsy. Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking. Whatever is in the cocaine other than the cocaine explains the memory loss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, actually, I was going for "she sneaks her boyfriend in while you're sleeping, and he wants to do it on the desk." And at first she says no, but she has issues with self-esteem.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Have the risks of the transplant procedure been explained to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Damn it. I was hoping you weren't going to ask her that. Of course she knows. Can you just sign the paperwork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. House explained to you that all surgeries carry risk? You could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And if you don't do it, daddy will die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Stop pressuring her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry. Daddy's perfectly healthy. But we want you to give him a kidney anyway because it'd be cool if he had three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Shut up. Do you understand the risks of living with one kidney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Samantha</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you still want to proceed with the transplant?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm saying you can proceed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm saying I can't.  Whatever he has, she has too. She's sleepwalking.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When your remote has a dead battery, you don't replace it with another dead battery. Whatever's killing the dad's kidneys is gonna kill the kid's too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It is possible the sleep issues aren't medically related. Maybe they're both insomniacs due to the turnpike noise. Maybe they both drink too much coffee, maybe —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> House is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because the daughter's sweating blood. If they have the same thing, it means there has to be a common cause. Which means it has to be a toxin, infection, or genetic. And since we've ruled out infections and toxins —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It narrows it down to any one of a dozen genetic disorders, each of which takes more than a week to run.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a genetic disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sure you're carrying a few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Symptoms are kidney failure, bleeding, and insomnia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You paid off the pool? Technically, anyone who didn't enter is a winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not over yet. Everyone's happy until they unwrap that pretty present and find they got a wall clock in the shape of Africa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Adoption's a cheat, remember? There's no real pregnancy, so there's no stranded dopamine receptors, so there's no postpartum depression. Cuddy will be the happiest new mother you've ever seen.  I've just given you the answer, haven't I? And now you're going to walk out of here without saying a word.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why the hell would you say they were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To make them happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For two seconds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Technically, to see if they can be happy. We should've seen a grin, a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They're sick. They're tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're anhedonic, incapable of experiencing pleasure. Something's bushwhacked their dopamine receptors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>They're depressed. Mom's dead. Dad's dying. You should know that being bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why their place had no music, no view, no decor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But if you can't feel pleasure, what's with the cocaine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? Is that why you do drugs? Because you're happy? Most people do 'em because they want to be happy. His subconscious craved it, needed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Most common cause of anhedonia is schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, in white folk.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>Jerry</speaker><content>Hammoud. Jamal Hammoud. Changed it when we invaded Iraq the first time. How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You and your daughter have Familial Mediterranean Fever. It's a genetic disease contracted by people of Mediterranean descent. Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs. Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney failure, even lactose intolerance. Symptoms are set off by age and stress. Kid couldn't get happy, but she could get stressed by daddy dying.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treatment tends to be hit and miss once you reach the sweating blood stage. Start them on colchicine and melphalan. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His kidneys are fried. If he doesn't have FMF, the colchicine will kill him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>My life, it's always been about pain, and anger, and disappointment. Never about love. And that's when I realized, you know, it could be. And I can't give that away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Becca, don't do this. Uh… what you're feeling is natural. But you're filled with hormones, and emotion, and fear, and… you just can't make a huge decision like this right now. You have to give it some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>Becca</speaker><content>I am… I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
