<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>What's that, baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>What's the difference between a sea lion and a seal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Um, seals tell the truth, but a sea lion's always lyin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>A sea lion has ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Yeah, that's right. I forgot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>I'll show you when we get to the zoo. Can we have pizza tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>I'm not gonna be here, Daisy. I'm-I'm going back on the road, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>You've only been here for two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>I'll be back in three weeks this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Woman </speaker><content>Somebody help her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Man </speaker><content>She's having a seizure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Man 2 </speaker><content>On the track?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Man 3 </speaker><content>Yeah, there's a lady down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>Daddy, come back! Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Hey. Lady, are you okay? Come on, come on, hey, wake up! Come on! Get up! Hey! Come on.  Help me! Somebody help me! Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Aah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Man </speaker><content>Hey, man, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Yeah, I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>She's epileptic. Come on, let's get you up. You got her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Man </speaker><content>Yeah, we got her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Hey, sweetie, I'm okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>Daddy? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You're right. EKG is more interesting than loss of consciousness, so—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>God, she's still talking. Make it stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The guy did a wonderful thing. Can't we just take that at face value? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are adorable. Heroism does exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What about the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>News flash — that guy was already on the plane. For all we know, he would have killed everyone else on board if it increased his chances. Faced with almost certain death, a normal person rides the pine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What about firefighters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The guys who undergo months of training to deny their own instincts for self-preservation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>And the patient isn't a firefighter. He plays a bass in a band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So humanity is apathetic and self-serving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I was mugged once. When I saw the gun, my legs went out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I always thought it was fight or flight. Didn't know it was fight or flight or faint. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Laugh all you want. The other hundred people stayed on that platform. That's a normal response to danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The coward has spoken.  Our patient's problem is neurological. Sympathetic stimulation — stress to the brain triggers a response in the heart. Go forth and look for masses in Clark Kent's limbic system.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Seems like you're getting a bit of attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Everyone keeps going out of their way asking me if I need anything. It's kind of nice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So what happened out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>I don't really remember. It's just images, like flashes. I kind of went on autopilot. My memory doesn't go back into real time until I was in the ambulance. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I read that's pretty common for people in life-or-death situations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Honey. Uh, this is my wife, Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Yeah, I'm fine. They're just doing some tests. How's Daisy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>She's not so good, actually. She watched her father jump in front of a train. Ugh. She's still shaking. She can't stop crying. Why would you do that to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He saved a woman's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>He could have died. Did you even think about your family?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I need your advice. Dinner with your mom on Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What? I can't. It's your birthday.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I need your advice. This film festival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I'm definitely coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>But Thursday is Cuddy's birthday, and her mom's coming down — it's a whole dinner thing.  And I thought, maybe if you see her, you could mention how upset you've been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You have to go. Your girlfriend's birthday? It's not even a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She has one every year. How often do you break up with the love of your life?  Okay, for you, it's more often than most, but still…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I'm a big boy. I think I'll survive.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Hey. Am I imagining things, or did I see a billboard with your face on it on my way home tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Oh, was my whole face there? 'Cause I just saw the nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>They did. I have no idea how it ended up just me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Well, you are pretty cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You're flirting with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>I don't see anyone else in the room. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I don't know. Things have been a little tense around here since that whole online-boyfriend thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No, you're the one with feelings for someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>You're still my husband.  I still love you.  And I want things to be okay between us.  Also, you're a famous model now. That's pretty cool… sexy, even.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So I advance through the carotid bifurcation…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Are you asking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Yes, I'm asking. I've only read how to do it. Practice is different than theory. Just tell me how to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're going to inject dye just past the takeoff for the optic artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Right. Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chases </speaker><content>His B.P.'s going up. The procedure's stressing his body. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, what do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hold on a minute. Just give him a chance to regain equilibrium. B.P.'s up, heart rate's 180.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>W-what should I do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So we finally know what Taub would look like if he were life-size. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Can we go back to the office now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You kidding? We got a differential to run. . Cardiac arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>That poster got me laid when I got home last night, so do your worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Arrhythmia proves I was right. Jack's problem is his heart, not his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So when you're not on a billboard, you sleep with nurses. But when you are, you sleep with your wife. I think you got that backwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>That's my elbow in the corner. What's your wife doing later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Huh. They chose you and cut out Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Apparently, marketing thinks my face is the most trustworthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>For real? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Both of our patients' cardiac incidents happened after physical stress. I'm guessing vasovagal syncope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Buzzkill. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Vasovagal syncope would manifest at a much younger age. Could be drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What about autonomic nervous system dysfunction? It could cause arrhythmia and fainting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Inappropriate? I mean, 'cause of the Jew thing? Autonomic nervous system dysfunction — I like it.  Let's biopsy his pituitary gland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Adrenal venous sampling makes more sense and is a less invasive procedure… which you don't care about, because you just want to check the pituitary, because you still think there's something wrong with the guy's brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Can't fool you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He has no other symptoms for pituitary disease. We can't stick a needle in his brain because you don't believe in heroism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fine, do it your way. You'll waste half a day, but I'm sure he's in no hurry to get better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary actions, like your heartbeat. If we're right, it's manageable, but will progress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I didn't know you knew Dr. Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You saw the ads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Look, no offense, but you were wrong yesterday. And they wouldn't have made him the face of the hospital if he weren't really good, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I forgot. You guys talk.  Look, no offense to either of you, but dinner with your mom? Come on, I-I'd have to act like a decent human being , and you know what a strain that puts on me. And you , ever since you broke up with Sam, you've done nothing but mope and whine. It's an unbelievable bummer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>And just what is so exciting you have to blow off both of us to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I just want to sit on my couch in my underwear, drink scotch, and watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey… by myself. I just want one night off. Is that so much to ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You have to choose one of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I do not whine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Jack's not exactly the hero type. He started this band in college. They gig around the country, looking for their big break. It's been 16 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>That must be hard on you and Daisy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>It's like I'm a single parent. I love him so much. But I'm at the end of my rope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>What Jack did yesterday was so incredible, our boss assumed his illness had something to do with his behavior. But if that's not the case, there's more to him than you think. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You think Taub really comes across as the most trustworthy doctor here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>They cut me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You're a pretty boy. Works well with the ladies, not so much with the patients. No one wants an underwear model performing their splenectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Well, I notice they weren't exactly knocking down your door looking for Dr. Trustworthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>That's 'cause I'm black.  Cortisol levels look normal. We were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Which House will interpret as him being right. He's gonna make us biopsy the pituitary gland.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You seem pretty calm for a guy who's surrounded by racists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>80% of the Princeton population is white. Some are racist. Some aren't. White works with both demographics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So race is your excuse, not the fact that you usually look like you're about to punch someone in the face? We're good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>O2 sats are dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He's not breathing. Suction. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Sats are coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Mucus plug. That's weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Fluid in the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Pneumonitis? That doesn't fit with anyone's theory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Our tests finally rule out the brain. That leaves the heart and the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Pneumonitis can be caused by bacteria, parasite, some kind of an obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Who was the girl on the tracks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>News story said her name was Chloe Jeffries. Why does that matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>'Cause there's another reason besides being sick that he'd risk his life for a stranger. She's not a stranger.  The damsel in distress is an epileptic. So we assumed she was having an epileptic seizure, but what if she wasn't? What if she's sick too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Jack is away a lot on tour. What happens on the road stays on the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>The most likely cause of pneumonitis is infection. Shouldn't we be getting a sputum culture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>There's no significant elevation of white blood cell count. This is more like toxic exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>He's got a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Why is your assumption of his guilt more valid than my assumption of his selflessness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Because my assumption is backed up by millions of men, and Taub, who've cheated on their wives. Find the girl and the love nest. Every hero has his Kryptonite.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>So we're breaking into this girl's apartment because House thinks that two people, standing 30 feet apart on a subway platform have to be lovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>God, you're a drag today. Let me guess. Back to fighting with the wife? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No. We had sex again last night… twice… and again this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Rachel hasn't wanted this much intimacy in a long time. I don't think it's me she's hot for. It's this Internet guy. She's just happy, and that's turning her on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>So she's not cheating on you, and you're getting all the action you can handle. I don't see the downside.  What was Jack's band called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Suicide… something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>EKG's unremarkable, thyroid, liver, and kidney function seems fine. You're perfectly healthy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>I wish that you would take a second look. I'm tired all the time, and when it's cold, I get this weird pain in my shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I have a pain in my leg. You don't hear me complaining…  Except for just now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>How do doctors get this idea you're better than everyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Probably all that pulling people back from the brink of death. It's just a guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>My own daughter is a doctor. She makes a hobby of dismissing my concerns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>Did she tell you to say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>That's hard to believe, since you're currently shtupping her. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We have a situation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Roach bombs, where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>In Chloe's apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Who's Chloe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Uh, look, we don't care about your personal life. We're not gonna tell your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Guess who showed up looking for Jack. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Chloe </speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>You okay? The E.M.T. said you'd gone to another hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Chloe </speaker><content>They help me overnight for observation. I'm fine. I had to come here to… I don't know why you did it, but thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>You're welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Chloe </speaker><content>I should have brought flowers or something. You're like my guardian angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>No. I'm just a guy in a band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Maybe you've heard of them? Suicide Season?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Chloe </speaker><content>One of my nurses gave me the CD. I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, but I have a feeling I'm going to be your biggest fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Getting a sputum culture. They obviously don't know each other, so it's not toxic exposure. Just leaves my theory — infection. If you could just cough up a sample, we can, uh, test for pathogens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Um…  Sorry, um… sorry, nothing — there's nothing coming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, maybe I can help you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Aah! Ohh! It hurts! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Chloe </speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>"When I saw her lying there, I thought, "'I can't just stand here and let her die. She has her whole life to live.'"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He didn't jump because he was sick or because he knew that girl. Even you have to admit that now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes, but that doesn't make him a hero. It makes him an idiot. The only reason that headline doesn't say "moron crushed by train" is luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Next headline is gonna be "moron goes undiagnosed because doctors won't talk about his ear pain."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Ear pain fits with my theory. Jack has an infection that's spread to his mastoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Great. We'll confirm that in a week, when your secret cultures have sprouted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Am I in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I only get mad when you waste my time. Couldn't care less about yours. But let me know when they come back negative, and I'll mock you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>You have a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nope, so I'm gonna pick one at random. Acoustic neuroma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>A tumor in the ear — makes sense. And if it's putting pressure on the breathing centers in his brain, explains the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>The lungs explain the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Evoked auditory potential test. This counts as my time. </content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I have been going out of my way to be nice to old Jewish ladies for months now on the off chance one of them could be your mom. You couldn't have mentioned she's a shiksa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>She converted when she married my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You see, now is too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm not blaming you for this. She's the one who ambushed you to find out what you were like, because I "never tell her anything."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'd have to agree with her on that one. Anyway, I obviously can't come to dinner now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Obviously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, she's crazy, and she hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House… I need you to come to that dinner for two hours, keep your mouth shut, and behave like an adult. Yes, you will be in hell, but I will feel better having you there. That is what a relationship is. We average our misery. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>That was… unexpected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>I'm having a good day. I finally resolved that thing with my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>What thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Oh, we had the worst fight over whether it's time to put Dad in that facility. Been sick over it for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You never mentioned anything about your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>I actually talked a lot about it with Phil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>It's fine now. I-it's no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Are you in love with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>I've never met him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Waves one and three normal at 70 decibels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>It's been 37 minutes, and everything is normal. House is wrong again. He doesn't have a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>House doesn't usually accept "we gave up halfway" as an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>If I could get fluid closer to the sources of infection, I could get better cultures, prove my theory.  I'm gonna set up for an ear drainage and thoracentesis. I'll only be wasting my time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>And I'm really proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>This whole thing has made me wonder… if things could be different. I have spent so much time away from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Yeah, well, you love your music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>But it's not just that. I think that I have been… afraid… that I would screw things up, that I couldn't be the man you and Daisy needed me to be. But maybe I'm better than that. Hmm?  I am going to quit the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Hey, how's the ear pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>It's better with the drugs, but it still really hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We are going to take some fluid samples from your ear and your lung. Can you get up? Lean forward. Lean on this. Okay, this is Lidocaine. It'll numb you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Okay.  This is weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What-what's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>The pain in my ear is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Gone? Completely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Yeah, when you stuck me in the back. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Okay, I'm just cutting that for you. Yum yum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>Is… is she going to eat anything else or just the cheese and crackers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>She's going through a picky phase — it won't kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>You're her mother. All I know is, when you and your sister were growing up, you ate what we ate. No excuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Would you pass the salt? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>She had eggs this morning, and lots of fruit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>Ah. That explains it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Explains what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>She was a little vilder chaiah in the park this afternoon. She wouldn't listen to anything I said. Must have been all the sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Actually, the whole sugar-makes-kids-hyperactive thing is a myth.  It's a study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm sorry. I have to get this.  Tell me you need me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Jack doesn't have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Masters stuck him in the back with Lidocaine, and his ear pain went away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>We don't need you here. We just need to figure out why this guy's body thinks his ear is on his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Because his ear used to be something else. When you're a fetus, your cells are close together. When you grow, they spread out and specialize. Sometimes the body screws up, and they keep the old area codes, report to the same pain centers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Referred pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Looks and brains. When you stuck him in the back, you cut off communication with the pain centers in his spinal cord. So we just need to figure out where the message is actually coming from. What about his thyroid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hyperthyroidism would explain all his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Or it could be his liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Good. We'll take a look at both. If it’s spreading to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>For the record, referred pain does not rule out infection—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Were you like this when you were working for your math degree? If Euclid had been a guest lecturer, would you have been the kid sitting in the front row going, "actually, you haven't proven the Pythagorean Theorem"?  Hello? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>All right. Mom…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>Thank you, sweetie.  So say you two got married, would you convert to Judaism? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm an atheist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>Honey, half the Jews I know are atheists. It's about community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House isn't that big on community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>And why do you call him "House"? The man's name is Greg. It makes it seem  like you're not serious.  I'm just trying to help you think about the future. You're-you're a certain age now.  The parade of boyfriends can't be as amusing as it was. You need to settle down, like your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Settling down isn't all it's cracked up to be. Next week is Sam's birthday. I was gonna take her to the Poconos and— </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>That's very sad. Perhaps not the best choice of topic for a festive occasion.  I just don't want Rachel growing up thinking you're a slut. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Oh, my God.  Did you…  sedate my mother? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Kicked in just in time. She'll wake up in a couple of hours, be good as new. Think of it as my birthday gift to you. You told me to keep my mouth shut. It's the only way I had a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sorry. I honestly thought you'd be worse.   That was my gift to myself. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I take it Jack's thyroid levels are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Foreman is doing a liver biopsy now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>What's up with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Nothing. I'm peachy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Have you even had sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We're not talking about me. We're talking about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No, you're talking about puppies, and I'm not listening. [Masters looks at Taub sympathetically.) She wants to do it all the time, but it has nothing to do with me. I'm just a piece of meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, she likes someone else, and you've slept with other people. Uh, why are you still together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I love her. We've been together for 22 years. I've never loved anybody else. I don't know how to… not be with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>So you're never gonna cheat again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Well, that seems kind of selfish, doesn't it?  Foreman found diffuse inflammation in Jack's liver. Looks like autoimmune hepatitis… Starting him on steroids. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>What's this note?  Does that sound like an "A"? Remember, I put my finger like this without this doohickey on it, it's an "F." See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Daisy </speaker><content>Hmm… Can we read a book instead? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Yes, we — Jack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Jack! Help him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Nurse </speaker><content>Come on. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He seized three times last night. We got him stabilized, but barely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If there was nothing wrong with his brain before, there sure is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Any particular reason we need to be looking at the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes. Cuddy's mom is in my office, and she looks mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Our patient also developed a raging fever overnight. That means Masters was right all along. This is an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Should we give you a minute to gloat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>We still don't know what kind of infection — could be bacterial, viral, fungal. Until the cultures—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You are the worst gloater ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Her starting those cultures when she did means we're 24 hours closer to the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>"We're sorry your husband croaked, but at least we were 24 hours closer to the answer." Let's narrow it down, shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Four days ago, the guy was facedown in the subway. God only knows what's in that sludge. Toxic fumes make him pass out — rat pee does the rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>If it's leptospirosis, it's the fastest-moving case in history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Leptospirosis can turn into meningitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>I can't confirm any of this yet, and we don't have time to choose wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It fits, and since it's the only idea on the table, I say it's a winner. Start him on doxycycline. No, wait. I'll do it. You guys have to go back to the office, tell me when bubbie's gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>You a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sure. You're on new meds. Go back to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Am I gonna die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, I hope not, 'cause then I'd have to go back to my office. Of course, if you do kick it, then you get to be famous for another two, maybe three weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>They're saying I'm a hero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, but, you know, in a few days, a panda bear will give birth to triplets, and we'll all move on. Oh, I'm sorry. You actually believe that you are a hero. Should get yourself some tights and a cape, run around Gotham pulling babies out of burning buildings. Maybe you'll keep getting lucky. You're still the same guy you were last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Hey, um… How long are you gonna sit there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Could be hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Hiding behind a sick guy… That's heroic. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I can explain. Sometimes I mix up my medications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>I don't need you to explain anything. I think we both know that… I owe you an apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>I don't even remember going to bed last night. I must have had too much to drink. I do know I can be difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You were a little bitchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>In the clinic, you were a complete schmendrick, but once you knew I was Lisa's mother, you held your tongue. That's because you love her.  I still think you're a pain in the ass with a God complex, and I'll kill you if you hurt her, but I'm glad she has you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We don't have to hug now, do we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>What do you think?  I've got a train to catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I thought you were staying till Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Arlene </speaker><content>I'm coming down with a cold. Every time I stay with Lisa or her sister, one of those rug rats gets me sick. Children are awful. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Did she have a rash recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>No. What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What is she doing here anyway? It's the middle of the morning. Shouldn't she be in school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>I'm keeping her out for a few days. There's been a little outbreak—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Chicken pox. Sorry, but if I let you finish that sentence, that would be much less impressive. Chicken pox is no big deal for kids, but it's a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad deal for grown-ups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>You think Jack has chicken pox? But he doesn't have blisters. He's not itchy, and Daisy never got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I know. Again, that's why it's so impressive that I figured it out. Five percent of cases present without blisters. The kid was just a carrier.  I'm gonna start you on anti-varicella gamma globulin, which will save your life. But it won't make me a hero.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Hey. How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>Like I'm not gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>I can't wait to take you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Jack </speaker><content>The guys called. All this press has got us a couple of new gigs — just a few more dates, three weeks, tops.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Three weeks isn't so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>It's not three weeks. It's what he's always done — just one more tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Eva </speaker><content>Yeah, the pathetic thing is I let myself believe that he could change, he could be this other guy. There's nothing worse than loving someone who's never going to stop disappointing you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>Culture confirmed Jack does have chicken pox. It just took six hours longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Autopsy works too. FYI, turns out your hero is a loser. He's going back on the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Masters </speaker><content>He still risked his life for that woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That was impulse. That was easy. Dealing with family is hard. Wait, that's another thing I got right. How many does that make?  And how many for you?  I'm also kicking your ass at gloating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I think we should get a divorce. You have feelings for him, and I can't handle that. But it's my fault you needed someone else. I keep hurting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>We love each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I know. But are you happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Rachel </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Then what are we doing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You know, you turned out remarkably close to normal, considering the genes in play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Here… In case your mom comes back.  Happy Birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes.  Oh, no, I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's, uh, bowling night. He'll never forgive me if I don't.  Oh, screw it. I'm coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, my chances of sex are considerably lower with Wilson.  Fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Hey. You ready?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Aah! Aah!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Dina Manzo </speaker><content>Again, this meeting is about me and setting my bounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Danielle Staub </speaker><content>Well, it's about me too, and I have my boundaries, Dina, and they have clearly been crossed by you and your entire family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Dina </speaker><content>That's not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Danielle </speaker><content>We all need improvements, Dina, and I formed my opinion on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Dina </speaker><content>Shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Danielle </speaker><content>No, don't shush me, Dina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Dina </speaker><content>No, I will shush you because you're not letting me finish.</content></utterance>
