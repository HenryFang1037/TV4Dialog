<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>I oughta go back and kick the hell out of that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>She's old enough. She didn't have to scream like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>It's okay, Dad. It didn't bother me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>For the first time, none of these people bothered me. I just think thirty-six more hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>Thirty-six more hours. How do you figure that, Kenny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Tomorrow at this time, I'm scheduled for surgery. It's a ten hour procedure, throw two in it for prep, thirty-six until I'm just another face in the crowd.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Kenny has a frontonasal encephalocele. It's a midline deformity. He's here to undergo a facial bipartition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>And what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Well, we have five surgeons...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>... four nurses. He's going to require six units of blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>Will it fix him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It'll repair a lot...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>of the damage done by the...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>We need a sound bite.  Would you say he'd be ready for the junior prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, well, that's probably true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>No, I need you to say it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ANESTHESIOLOGIST</speaker><content>We got an issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>ANESTHESIOLOGIST</speaker><content>Heart rate's skyrocketing. It's over 180.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He's in v-fib. Paddles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Charge to 300.  Turn that camera off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Is this a reaction to anesthesia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>ANESTHESIOLOGIST</speaker><content>Haven't given it yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Clear!  Crank to 360.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> I said 'Turn that damn camera off!'  Clear!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>A teen-aged boy with a cranio-facial deformity was about to undergo a reconstructive procedure when he had an unexplained cardiac arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I mean... go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We have the patient on a pacing wire. It's the only thing keeping his heart going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, we know. We're doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Right. I was just... it was just for them... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>Just be yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Until we are able to figure out exactly what is causing the heart block, the reconstructive surgery is on hold, obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> That's yourself?  Fascinating case.  I will see you again after I have saved his life.  Have a warm bath waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You following me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Darnell will be trailing you throughout the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>Pretend we're not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If I do that, won't I bump into you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>We'll stay out of your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You know, it's a joke.  See, I became a doctor because of the movie 'Patch Adams'. Uh, listen, do you want to get ahead of me, maybe back up, I don't know, low down, makes me look more powerful...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content> That's, that's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Yeah. Also my eyes look better in...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>...rooms with summer colors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>You know what, it's black and white...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You think I LIKE the cameras?  You think I want the whole world watching you check out my ass and question my wardrobe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Would it be better if I checked out your wardrobe and questioned your ass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> A little part of me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There is no little part of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> ...thought that maybe you would see what great PR this could be for the hospital, and not make ME force YOU to act like a human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You using force on me is... intriguing.  On the other hand, cameras make people act. Sometimes like human beings, sometimes just weird, sometimes they wear open-tipped bras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It's cold in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Less obvious point is that I need my team to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>That production company is covering all the medical costs for this kid. So, either you let them continue filming... or the kid goes home with the same face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sorry about that. Private.  She waxes her mustache once a month... sometimes gets some pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>So, did he hire you flat out, or are you competing for one of the spots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>TERZI</speaker><content>I'm not sure what you mean by that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>VOLAKIS</speaker><content>She's not competing. She was hand-picked by House. She's safe, like Foreman, so that takes three spots down to one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Where's Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>He's in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good. Come on, let's go for a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Walks look good on camera. They give the illusion of the story moving forward.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>New patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>...infranodal heart block, post-arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Any reports of light-headedness or syncope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Certainly not light-headedness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Why did you hire her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not in front of the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Are we going to be on TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm making a music video. Come on, move faster, more energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> Why are you glad Foreman's not here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Hey buddy!  You stay in there. We'll be out here making sure he doesn't move again.  Gah! FINALLY hear myself think. Our patient has...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Why did you hire her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because she has way more diagnostic experience than the other swimsuit models I was considering.  Our patient has a frontonasal encephalocele with a midline cleft.  Ew. Don't stare directly at it.  So, what caused Big Head's heart to stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Simple. His big head. Increased intracranial pressure would cause heart block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wrong. Sixteen years they've been testing that insane noggin to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TERZI</speaker><content> What about a congenital heart defect? He has a midline anomaly on his head, makes sense he'd have a midline anomaly in his heart too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That sixteen years of testing didn't show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Why did you bring her in so late? It's not fair. The rest of us...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hey hey! You want fair, you picked the wrong job. The wrong profession.  The wrong species. Forget the deformity. Treat the patient like he's any other really, really ugly kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Infection. Could be endocarditis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Well, since he doesn't have a prosthetic heart valve, I assume you're thinking he's an IV drug user?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>House said assume he's normal. Dealers don't ask for ID and don't care what you look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nice. You're right about the habit, you're wrong about the substance.  Blackened skin under the nose equals frostbite from huffing Freon. Freon's toxic, damages the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Discoloration could be acanthosis nigricans. It's a common side effect of these deformities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>There's also discoloration on the cheeks and forehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Do a nuclear study. If I'm right, you'll see scarring of the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>TERZI</speaker><content>I'm not part of some game, am I? I gave up a career because I thought this was a firm offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes. This is a real offer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think she might be an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But she can't be an idiot. She's in the CIA, for God's sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>The Bay of Pigs was a daring triumph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She had good ideas in Langley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>All your ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She was able to identify that they were good ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Stab in the dark here. Is she pretty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She's new. She's nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>She's a 'C' cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She said one dumb thing in the differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>They ALL say dumb things in differentials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>A 'D' cup?  If she's no good, just fire her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I can't! I just hired her. She left a career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Either that's actual guilt, or I've GOT to see this woman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>My son is not 'huffing Freon'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a savant when it comes  to diagnostics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>What's his genius theory? Because Kenny's not normal,  he's doing drugs to deal with his pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Maybe a way to look at this is that you ARE normal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>And what's that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You're like any other parent... who thinks HIS kid can't be doing drugs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Doing this because my dad thinks I'm on drugs?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I was doing drugs behind my parent's back at your age, and I had a lot less reason to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Not that your life must be miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Not that I am suggesting you should be doing drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>I'm homeschooled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Really? You're lucky. Going to school was boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>My dad took me out and it wasn't because it was 'boring'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I had a rough time in school too. Maybe not like you  but, uh, well... I don't mean to compare our situations.  Actually, I guess I am comparing our situations, but only to show you how yours is worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>You can edit that out, right? So I don't look like an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Relax. Everyone acts like an idiot around me. Makes ya think it's not an act. Can I have something for my headache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Yeah. Is that new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Sixteen years old. It has the same birthday I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> I'm gonna start the test now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Studies showed no signs of scarring in Kenny's heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>It wasn't drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, then give me something better. What's causing heart block?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Could be toxoplasmosis. We should do an LP to test for infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd've seen enlarged lymphs. And because you're not pretty enough to be an idiot, you must know that already. Which means you just said it because you want to do an LP for intracranial pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Because it IS intracranial pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wait. I'm not done. You thought I wouldn't catch on, which means either you think I'M an idiot, which is flattering, doing my hair differently, or ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>The kid's got headaches. He's been popping acetaminophen like peanuts...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> How could you POSSIBLY think that I was done? I prefaced that with an 'either'. It needs an 'or'.  Or you ARE an idiot. Which is possible. I'm not great at judging men's looks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>The OR?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>DARNELL</speaker><content>And the MRI room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Yes.  Dr. House frequently conducts differential diagnosis in a variety of places.  He feels that a... change in venue often leads to a change in thinking processes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I have to go take care of something else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Just let me do a CT scan, see if I'm right. The sooner we fix the problem, the sooner we can get to his reconstructive surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Who cares if you're dead? It's how you look. Well, since you've given me nothing better, we're back to drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>The one thing we're know it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Decreased uptake on the membranous septum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Could be an artifact. We can redo it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But nothing's nothing. Do an EP study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>EP study means we have to stop this kid's heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I'll set it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>I'm gonna thread this catheter through different areas in your heart. And once I've found the right pathway, I'll apply some electrical energy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Will it stop my heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Sounds worse than it is. You'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>It gonna hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>There'll be some discomfort.  If you've done drugs, I understand. Being different's really hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Kenny. Uhm, it's more important for you to get better than to worry about getting in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>If I did drugs, that could explain my heart problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>It could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Then you could do the surgery to fix my face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>That's why we're here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>You know how famous people, everywhere they go, people are watching them, staring? They never have a chance to just be.  Ya know? And a lot of them turn to drugs. People stare at them because they're beautiful. But me, they just stare at....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You okay?  I need to know what kind of drugs, Kenny... and how much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>KENNY</speaker><content>Uhm, coke, mostly. Lotta coke. And then uh, when I run out, I used to go to LSD. Or acid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Those are the same thing.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>The father refused steroids until we're sure about the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I AM sure.  It's JRA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And why would he even doubt that, unless a FORMER fellow of mine was chirping in his ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>The decision was his. I merely voiced my concern.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No-one is firing anyone in the middle of this case. Not while those cameras are here, and not while Taub is the ONLY person that his father trusts.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>To do what I always do in these situations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Treat my patient behind his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>That's one option. Or you can do a CT scan of the kid's head. If there's no mid-line shift, we know Taub's wrong and you get your consent to give the kid steroids.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="55-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah.  He went nuts. Apparently you signed a non-compete. Now why would you agree to that?</content></utterance>
