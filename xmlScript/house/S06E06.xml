<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>But you didn't find anything life-threatening, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You fell 30 feet. You should have died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Brian</speaker><content>I think that was the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>Could you shut up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You have suicidal thoughts?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Why do you think you're gonna die soon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>Well, my dad, grandfather, and great-grandfather all dropped dead of heart problems right after they turned 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Brian</speaker><content>Look who turns 40 next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I can refer you to a cardiologist, if you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>Nah, I’ve been there. All of them. I spent my early 30s going from one doctor to another. Every single one says my heart's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And you think they're wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>I know they're wrong. But what can I do? At a certain point, you just got to live your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Brian</speaker><content>By live your life, you mean risk your life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Six weeks. Longer than I thought it would take... For you to notice that I’m sleeping in your living room, and offer other options. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn't expect you to be here this long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you really need to deconstruct this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay, yes you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>After she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study... Except it's not a study, it's a shrine.  Can I tell you something?  I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. I am not ready to transition from my dead girlfriend's shrine to your... morning glory. I'll have a mattress delivered and set up for you in the tabernacle. I just need it Tuesdays for animal sacrifices.  Oh, man!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You saying we ignore three generations of cardiac problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You hate coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We reconciled.  It was a whole thing. Big country. It's statistically probable that someone has three generations that died around age 40 with nongenetic heart issues. Dice have no memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Genes do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we ran a battery of tests on every nonsymptomatic statistical anomaly —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The guy goes every day assuming his life will end at age 40. Never got married, no kids, because he didn't want to die on them the same way his dad died on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want to take this case 'cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy. You should have been a vet.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Differential diagnosis for a genetic heart condition.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you. And by the way, I agree with you too, especially in those pants. We're not wasting our time and last week, Chase said that I was the de facto boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hospitals don't recognize de facto medical licenses. Let's start with genetic tests. Get an EKG, cardiac cath, and an echo to check the integrity of his heart.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>With regards to your employment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like things the way they are. I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you. Until now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Pretend time's been going on long enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I’m gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow. You need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I don't.  I'm not saying you don't win. I'm just saying do you really need to punish me by making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's a state requirement. I have to certify that you've completed all your require —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. The requirement sets out what you have to do – certify – which you can do with one hand tied behind your back. Now, if you want to tie my hands...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Send him home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>To continue believing he's gonna drop dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When he turns 70, he'll believe us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are other things we can check.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Skeleton of great-grandfather's in decent shape. Subsurface genetic material from grandpa's fine, leaving one bowl of purified dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You do the dad. I take it he had a sealed casket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The watch story was crap, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I forgot it. It's no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were avoiding the ICU where Dibala died.  I'll sequence the gene for the cardiac sodium channel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack.  I've crossed some line... and I’m having trouble getting back to the other side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I can move the patient to another room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cameron will ask questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You should tell her. She's your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How'd you get a court order to dig them up so fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don’t we just need the guy's consent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not yet. But you're just in time to do the dad.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He'll be back in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I read in the paper you're treating a police officer. Donny Compson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Second floor. A nurse will help you find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I don't want to see him. Donny and I used to go out a long time ago. He doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So did you come to see me for personal advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>You're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I'm not worried about me. Donny doesn't know this, but he has a son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Dial extension 742. Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Couldn't find any consistent genetic mutations across 15 areas between Donny’s ancestors, possibly indicating there isn't one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But the son gives us a new data point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And undegraded DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I thought he didn't want kids.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> "Dear bleeding hearts, since your patient's med history is a coincidence and he isn't...  … sick, I've gone back to school. Back in 120 hours."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Charming. I'll get a blood sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If we're looking for something as subtle as a mutation, it makes sense to get the DNA where it's most pure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're gonna ask the mom to consent to a bone marrow biopsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She wants to know if there's something wrong with Donny just as badly as we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. Spike a ten-year-old's hip because grandpa was sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If she's right... we save two people. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You need to tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His father is down that hallway through those double doors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I've been lying to him his whole life. What's he gonna think of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're trying to protect him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content> Donny never wanted kids. He certainly doesn't want to meet him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we're all here to learn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Singh</speaker><content>You know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She tell you how to stop me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Singh</speaker><content>Look, I’m asking you as an adult to please stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that obviously didn't come from her. But fair enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Singh</speaker><content>Excellent presentation, Nona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now I’ve done it. There's urine everywhere! Gosh. The great thing about the teacher-student relationship is the teacher can often learn more from the student.  Have you learned anything yet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>You have a son. I was pregnant when we broke up. I'm sorry I never told you, but I knew how you felt about having kids.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>Maybe. It's a little late for that.  He's here. He wants to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>I don't want to meet him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I've never asked you for a dime. He's here to help find whatever's wrong with your heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>I didn't ask him. I didn't want him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>Just say hi to him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content>When you get better, maybe we could do something. See a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>No. My dad died when I was your age. It was the most painful thing I ever went through. Trust me, as much as I’m sure this hurts right now, it's better. Please take him out of here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nabasynth.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His apartment manager found him on the floor in the laundry room. Said he wasn't breathing. He called the EMTs, but it was too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I sent the guy home with mints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whatever it is, we all missed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I missed the fact that there was something to miss. What is wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You had good reason. Patient presented with no symptoms, and all his tests came back negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's the official cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Autopsy hasn't been performed yet. EMTs brought him to General, but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's the sort of thing she needs to hear face-to-face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everything's fine. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Last week, I understood that you were stressed out about the Dibala M and I gave you your space. But that's over now, and you're still acting...  I'm worried about you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? 'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Opening postmortem incision. Beginning at the midline of the sternum. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's odd. It almost looks like he's... bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He was briefly conscious, then his systolic dipped below 60, and he was out again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Obviously he wasn't dead. His heart slowed enough that the EMTs —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's several documented cases where tetrodotoxin ingestion caused apparent death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It wasn't something he ate. It's something he already had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And his dad, and his grandpa, and —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if it's not his heart?  Let's work from the tenuous assumption that we're not idiots who've spent days examining a heart up, down, sideways – declaring it healthy just a few hours before it basically shut down. So we need to think about causes in places you didn't look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be metabolic.  You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about a genetic predisposition to an autoimmune disease? Isolated anti-ro antibody could cause complete heart block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could also be passed through four generations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> You just came through a severe trauma. What do you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content> I was changing my laundry over to the dryer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That's it? You were declared dead. You made it all the way to autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Donny</speaker><content>My jaw aches. And obviously I don't have Ortoli syndrome. It's hard to get too excited about coming back from the dead when anything I do, anything you give me – It all ends the same way.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if I, uh... If I sometimes hear whispering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Ayala</speaker><content>Then you're probably hearing someone whispering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid. Adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up AM radio signals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Ayala</speaker><content>Open your mouth.  Your fillings don't touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Ayala</speaker><content>I can only tell you that you're hearing sounds as you should. If you're also hearing sounds that you shouldn't, well, that would be psychosis. You'd have to talk to someone who does brain. I only do ears.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The pain is real. It's coming from somewhere. What about bone cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can't connect bone cancer to the heart. House figure this can wait till the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, he told Cuddy he wasn’t ready to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He quit?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's a power play. He'll be back tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Bone cancer could trigger a paraneoplastic syndrome, which shuts down the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Li-Fraumeni syndrome. It's hereditary, and it increases a person's risk of having bone cancer.  You have another theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My theory is it's not bone cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay? You don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two mysteries, cool. Theories?  Did I come in too soon? Okay, I’m gonna take another lap. And I want three new ideas by the time I come back. One of them's got to be not stupid.  Where there's pain... there's nerves. Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Miscommunication in the brain stem mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It would explain the bradycardia too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I like the word "hereditary" in the title.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You should congratulate me for not wasting your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you getting some help? Or is this the way things are gonna be from now on? What's pathetic is you haven't gotten help because you want to feel bad. You want to suffer, 'cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath. Patient needs some carbamazepine.

And if our fake tests confirm it, I'm gonna be cutting into your son's brain too,  'cause I’m just that committed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That's what I thought. The "saving the kid from pain" stuff was crap.
