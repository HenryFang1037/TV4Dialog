<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>Seems high to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>That's a fair price for quality like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>I'll give you 30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>What? I thought you were joking. I didn't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>Who am I dealing with here, Eddie? Him or you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Mickey, relax. Now, if things move forward with Gorski, he lets us into Philly, then maybe I cut you a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>You cut me a break now, or maybe you don't get with Gorski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content> Marco... I thought we had an understanding.  Whoa, whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>Tommy, don't be stupid. Put the gun down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>First, he shows you some respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> Hey, you just – just listen to your boss, all right, moron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>You shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Just relax, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>Agh! Oh, God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>What the hell were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content> I didn't shoot him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>Are you sure? Look at him. He's face-down on the pavement!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content>I nailed myself in the foot! God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>I–I don't think he's hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Marco</speaker><content>Then what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Tommy</speaker><content> Let's get outta here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Come on, Mickey, wake up.  Mickey! Wake up!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>We almost done here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Assuming you did this shaving your forehead... Okay, then. I'm ordering a head C.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>No, I don't have a headache. I'm not dizzy. Eddie, I gotta get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>You gotta stay here. We'll straighten out that mess with Marco tomorrow. Let the doc do his job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, stitching you up is really the E.R. doc's job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Yeah. Too long of a wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Also, a lot of cops in the E.R.  Not that you care about that. So how did this happen?  Yeah, you're right. That was a stupid question. 'Cause the answer's kind of obvious. No scrapes on your hands means you didn't try to break your fall. Means either out cold or totally disoriented when you went down. No sign of trauma other than the cut means no one hit you in the head. Powder burn on your jacket sleeve means someone shot a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>All right, Eddie. Come on, let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care what you guys are into. If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Whoa. What will?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This.  Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>32-year-old man, recent developed loud-noise-induced vertigo. C.T. was clean. No internal bleeding, no edema. Everything else is in the file.  Cameron get your hair in the divorce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This guy strained his back three years ago. And that's it. All the rest of these pages are blank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, he won't tell us anything. Understandable, since he's a drug dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So he's dangerous and withholding, which you find irresistible.  But guys like that, they never call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He actually said he was a drug dealer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not out loud. But he was wearing a solid gold Patek Philippe. His friend had a Rolex. But their phones were prepaid burners, so they can toss 'em as soon as they're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It doesn't matter if this guy's a drug dealer or not. Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain. Head C.T. was clean, so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma. We need to do an A.B.R. to test his hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Acoustic neuroma fits. So does lidocaine toxicity. Or benzocaine – depends what he's cutting the coke with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So now he's not just a drug dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He seemed peppy. You test his ears. I'm gonna go test his cocaine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think this guy's just gonna hand over a briefcase full of illegal drugs because you ask nicely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hope not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So the best coffee's at Geena's, and the best pizza is at Gino's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Yeah, and don't mix those up, because the coffee at Gino's could kill ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And how's the drycleaner on the corner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Go two blocks over to Eco-Clean. The one on the corner used to shred all my boyfriend's shirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>In retrospect, I should really thank those cleaners. We broke up. This is my stop. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>So if you have any more questions about the neighborhood, I'm your girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Uh, favorite sushi place. Maybe we could get dinner sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Sure... if you promise to bring that good-looking guy with the cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You mean House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Your boyfriend's name is House? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> H–he's not my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Oh...  Heh, I'm sorry. Wh-what do you call each other? Husband? Partner? Lover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> We're not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're gonna hear a series of clicks and hisses. Sensors measure electronic activity to your auditory nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>How long is this gonna take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>An hour, maybe an hour and a half. Or you could walk away with a tumor in your ear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Guy's probably late to a stabbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Impedances look good. Starting at 13 clicks per second at 50 decibels. Check this out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thirteen's middle name is Beauregard?  Wave three latency is 3.8.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Slightly delayed, but nothing significant. That's what sticks out to you? House is clearly screwing with us. It's a fake paystub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Looks real to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's no way she makes that much money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I make that much money.  And... apparently, you don't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>We're in textiles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I need the drugs! Hmm... works for Jack Bauer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Is this really necessary? The chairs in the hall are way more comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But way less genre-appropriate. Okay, here's the deal. I need information. You have reasons not to give me that information. So either I can force it out of you...  or I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>I wish I could tell ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay... Well, let's work with that. Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles. What's your major product? Is it "h"? And by that I mean "hosiery."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>We do more with... culottes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that with a "c" or a "k"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>"C." Nobody wants "k" anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does your friend cut the fabric?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No, he's a sales guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, he must cut a culotte here and there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No one touches the culottes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm interrogating a suspect. Make it quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Everyone in our building thinks we're gay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're grown men over the age of 30 who moved in together. We're two tigers away from an act in Vegas. They'll figure out we're straight eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Eventually is not when I want to go out with the cute girl in 3-B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Any chance I could get some water over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If only there was some way to communicate that information to her. Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds. If only the larynx was capable of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She didn't believe me. She sidestepped my dinner invite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And a woman would only reject you because she's worried that you might not be interested in her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We were chatting, having fun. There was definitely a spark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When she thought you were gay. You sure your friend isn't secretly tr –  What is a culotte, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Pants that hang like a skirt.  Just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Mickey hates the stuff. He's one of the few guys I trust to watch the product overnight. They took him away an hour ago. You think he's okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's an ear test. Pretty sure he'll live.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pupils are constricted. Pulse is bounding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Airway's clear. Need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Gotta be his blood pressure. We need to get it down before he strokes out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>At least we know his ears are okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We put the patient on vasodilators, got his hypertension under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He got worse here at the hospital. Means thug life probably isn't what's making him sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which means we can stop the bloodhound gang routine and go back to being doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> But we're doctors all the time. It's so boring.  Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be sick sinus syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No chest pain, shortness of breath. Brain aneurysm secondary to polycystic kidney disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Normal urinalysis. Kidney's impalpable.  Is... that a new watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Thought I'd give myself a little treat. What if it's not his brain, but it's on the way to his brain? Carotid stenosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get an ultrasound of his carotids. See if his arteries are clogged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How much money do you make?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I want a raise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I will be happy to talk about that at your next review... in August.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know that you're paying me less than everyone else on the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I can't discuss other people's salaries. You know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Now that they know I'm making less than they are, they'll never respect me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> And who told them how much you make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not fair for me to make less than the people I supervise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Salary isn't about fairness. It's about what you can leverage in negotiation. Which isn't much without a competing offer on the table. And we both know you don't have one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Ultrasound showed no narrowing or obstruction in the patient's carotid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not that he's worried – keeps asking me when he can leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>A place in the business of healing people, you'd think they'd have better chicken soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You bugged his room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our patient sleeps in the building where they keep their stash. Eventually, he'll say something that gives away where that is. And we'll find out what's making him sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But we ruled out environmental causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ruled out environmental causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And you pretended to agree, just so we'd take him out of his room so you could plant the bug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Carotid stenosis was a decent idea. But an even decent-er idea is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells. Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If we're going with toxic exposure, we should just start testing for the most likely suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Bug's a better idea than blindly running tests for days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell him it'll take weeks. It'll be faster.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>What do you mean weeks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>These tests take time. There are a lot of possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>No, but I-I can't sit here this long. I got things I gotta take care of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you're worried about all the poor school children going without their drugs, I'm sure someone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I wanna be discharged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll get the forms.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Beats sitting in a lab all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In the lab there is significantly less chance of getting killed. You're too close. Slow down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're in a car in broad daylight. What's gonna happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You honestly think he doesn't have a gun in that car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That he's gonna use to shoot doctors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just... back off.  Hey, well played with the watch, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Borrowed it from a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How much longer are we gonna keep lying to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Until it's no longer fun. We all thought he needed to be taken down a few notches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So we're just having fun, not getting even?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's gonna get away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>3-B? You're Nora, right? My roommate tells me you're the one to thank for all the tips about the neighborhood. Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hear you thought that Wilson and I liked to polish each other's swords. And by swords, I mean pistols.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Of course he told you about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised that doesn't happen more often. We're both straight.  Oh, my... God, that is beautiful.  We finally have the room to display it the way it deserves. Would you – would you help me get this upstairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice shoes, by the way. Louboutin?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You talk to Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Shot me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So, uh, what are you gonna do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'll wait for my review in August.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Nothing. That's what I would do. But I'm a coward.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Yvette</speaker><content>His friend brought him in 15 minutes ago. Temp's 105. Pulse is weak and thready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>He's not making any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> It's too much money, Eddie. That wasn't the deal. That wasn't the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Is he gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Eddie!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We gave him antipyretics and soft steroids to reduce the fever and prevent organ damage. He's no longer delirious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Patient went out, came back worse than before. Points us back to environmental, tied to wherever he went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it doesn't. Where's Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He had a meeting with Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What do you mean, "No, it doesn't"? We screwed up the tail. My car was impounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True, amusing, and irrelevant. Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mazel tov. Should be fun to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're off environmental?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wherever he went, it wasn't for long enough. Add in the fever and infection's way more likely. And if it is an infection, his symptoms suggest it's moved to his brain. Which means...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I'll do a lumbar puncture.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Next time you're tailing someone, take two cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You knew we were following you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> I'm sorry. I had to lose you. I had business to take care of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right, because you're a businessman. Do you know how many junkies come into the E.R. every week with their brains melting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I'll bet there's more drunks with their livers giving out. A liquor store owner laying on this table – I'm guessing he doesn't get attitude.  Aah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I hit bone. His old back injury must have flattened out his discs. Sorry, but I've got to try this again. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Yeah. An adult wants to get wasted, why is it anybody's business what substance they use?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Because some of those substances are against the law.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Look at his heart rate.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I ran into Nora this morning. She told me about your Evita listening party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The London and New York recordings are so different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You were supposed to tell her that we're straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She didn't believe me, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You're doing this to mess with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Correction – I started doing this to mess with you. Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>By pretending you're gay and in a relationship with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We're in a relationship and we're really unhappy. Communication's never been easy for us. Probably 'cause we're so closeted. I got it all figured out. Nora and I spend the next few weeks hanging out, become best girlfriends. I confide in her about our issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I can't decide if this plan is more despicable or illogical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then, one night, we get drunk... back rub turns into a front rub... The next morning, "I've never felt this way about a woman before."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's... quite a commitment you've made to jumping the girl I'd like to date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'd like to date her. In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I saw her first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're guys. It's a code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're only bringing this up 'cause you know you're gonna lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not an infection, but it might be an autonomic nerve disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The hair is still bumping me. Did you get it cut because you're ready for the next chapter or –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We stuck a needle into his spinal bodies twice. His heart rate stayed normal. If we add that to his other symptoms...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's never gonna fall for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, then, you got nothing to worry about, sweetie.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a wuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> Say that when I'm better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, are you gonna beat me up? That sounds stressful. Maybe you should pop one of your beta blockers first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You have a heart problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Medically, no. He would have told us about that. Metaphorically...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>It's an effect from operating outside of the law. Sometimes, I have to do bad things. And not always to bad people. Last few months, that hasn't been so easy. A guy got me the pills.  And they control the stress. Look, don't – don't say anything to Eddie. All right? The last thing I need is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When was your last pill before we originally admitted you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Um, the night before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And we stuck you in here, and you went into beta blocker withdrawal. That's what caused the hypertension. When he got out of here, he took another pill, and the hypertension went away. Which means it was never a symptom. We take that off the table, we've got vertigo, fever...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>…and stress. He's been in this game for a while. Either he grew a conscience over the last few months or he's producing excess adrenaline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pheochromocytoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's Greek for, "You'll be back doing bad things to good people in no time."  M.R.I. his adrenal glands. You're okay with that, right? You're not gonna put a pillow over his face?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>You know what? It's going good. How about I just learn to keep people out of our business? And that's the real thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content> Hi, James. We've got some kung pao left.  Oh! God. Right there. Oh. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're having a picnic... with wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>I'll pour you a glass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She told me I needed leverage. So, I told her about an offer I had to help run the neuro department at Mercy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wow. Are you really gonna take the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There is no other job. I bluffed. She called it. I'm not gonna beg to be underpaid. I'm leaving when this case is over.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House is lying to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>I know. And so are you. It's 2010, I mean... You know, nobody cares if you're gay anymore. I mean, you don't have to be in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not, I... Look around you. Does this really look like a place gay men live? A-apart from the poster. Those stools are our only furniture. There are no window treatments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Well, my ex-boyfriend didn't even know what window treatments were.  Is that Greg's Carpenters album or yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Look, House hates musicals and fashion and meringue. This whole thing is an act designed to earn your trust...  in order to sleep with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Finally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>You're jealous. You know, if you want to spend more time with Greg, you should just tell him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were wrong. M.R.I. revealed no sign of a pheochromocytoma, which means Mickey's stress is just stress. We're back to vertigo and fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And environmental is back at the top of our list of suspects. We're trying to narrow down the possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That receiver doesn't respond to manual stimulation. Maybe if you took off your shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Actually, I resorted to something more exotic. I call it reading the instructions. Turns out if you screw the antennae into the wrong sockets, it doesn't actually work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We lost Mickey just outside Trenton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> It's supposed to search for an open frequency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Most buildings there were built between 1920 and 1940. We're compiling a list of toxins most common –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's got to be at least one open frequency.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a few minutes with your friend. Or stay if you want.  Rectal exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>I'll check out the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why the beta blockers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Valium and Xanax actually reduce stress. Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking, and all those stage fright issues. That's why some people take them when they perform.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is my bug.  And this... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Um...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This... This is yours. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You bugged your own room? Are you... an informant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An informant would have sold his pals out to us at the first sign of a sniffle. This guy... is a cop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't see how this is relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the land of no fun, you got a really sensible piece of property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Give him a break. Knowing this guy's an undercover cop doesn't get us any closer to curing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good point. You know what they say. Information is not power. Wait...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're saying we should use the cop thing to force him to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Force? I'm talking about the womanly art of persuasion.  I said womanly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If you won't talk to us, we'll find someone who will. I mean, you must have a supervisor. A... handler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Good luck with that. You don't know my real name. You don't know if I'm local or state, F.B.I., D.E.A. But, by all means, get on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I get it. These guys are lowlifes. You want off the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>They're not just lowlifes. Eddie killed a snitch three weeks ago. Boss' orders. The-the boss, he's one of the biggest cocaine importers in the entire state. And he wants to expand down to Philly. Tomorrow night, he and Eddie are meeting the big fish. And the cops are gonna bust it. But if you guys get caught poking around there, the whole thing gets called off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's noble, but you can't put your life at risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I've been undercover for 16 months. I haven't seen my wife... my house, my dog. I have put far too much into this, and I will not let it fail. So just... just keep me alive for another 24 hours. And I will tell you everything you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Hey. Uh, can I come in? Nurses out here can't keep their hands off of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> He's a Casanova, huh? What, you bringing me my sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No, because, guess what. I don't read minds.  You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Aggh! Gah! Aaaa!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He had a G.I. infarction caused by a clot in his superior mesenteric artery. We had to remove a foot of bowel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Any more clots keep forming, he may not last 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the moron still won't talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Guy's a hero. He's risking his life to put these dealers in jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure the dealers who take their places will be very grateful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So vertigo, fever, and thrombosis. We've already ruled out cancer and infection. He got worse on steroids, which suggests it's not autoimmune. So we're stuck with environmental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But what kind of environmentals? Toxins, parasites, allergens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We should just pick the top ten possibilities and treat for all of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Except that treating for everything could kill him faster than whatever's killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sort of. Chase is right. Our patient is holding out for noble reasons: protecting his bust. Anybody else on that crew got sick, I'm guessing they'd be a little more self-serving.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Surgery went well. You'll be able to see him soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Yeah, used to be all about Ferberizing your kid. Now they're saying it could mess them up. Heh. My – mine's six and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Mickey's getting worse. The clot is a very bad sign. We really need you to tell us where he's been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Heh. I do that, there's a very good chance that I could end up John Doe at the county M.E.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Look, Mickey got sick because he had the most exposure. Other guys are at risk too. You don't want to...  You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>I – I feel dizzy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Are you diabetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When was the last time you were at your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Whoa... did you drug me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>You're trying to make me think that I'm sick so I'll take you to the stash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Of course not, but if you are sick –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No, I don't feel sick. I feel drugged! Trust me, I know the difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You didn't even drink half of it. You'll be fine in an hour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>You think Mickey could die? Ah, it's just a deal. I'll take you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Couldn't have given us a heads up that he was living</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I gotta cover all our bases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Look... back there. Hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What are these, more chemicals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Oh, not exactly.  Uh... If this stuff was the problem, there'd be a lot more sick people.  Did you call the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>No one's supposed to be here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Um... uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Look, the deal was just for you. This guy wants to watch, it's an extra 50.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How's it coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So far, nothing. Carpet, paint, insulation. Even the gross food in the fridge. Everything's coming up clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Which leaves the dry-cleaning chemicals. Should have the results in a few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Foreman's already started him on inhaled albuterol. Chances are, this case is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We have to tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can't tell him. Won't change the fact that Cuddy let him walk. It'll just let him know it was all because of a stupid prank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> We have to tell Cuddy. We confess and beg her to take him back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If begging worked, he would have a raise, and we wouldn't be screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Albuterol is not helping. Patient started coughing blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about adding ipratropium? That might –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't bother. We assumed this place was using perchloroethylene. Turns out... petroleum solvents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The drug dealers are running a green drycleaner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I hate to push past the irony, but our patient's bleeding into his lungs, and we've got nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The V/Q scan last night showed a pulmonary aneurysm. Explains the coughing blood. I did an embolization to stop the bleeding, he then started up again this morning. Three more aneurysms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Those look like mycotic aneurysms. Indicates a fungal infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That'd be consistent with his other symptoms: the vertigo, the fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I didn't see any fungus at the location, and none of the samples –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like somebody missed something. Which is embarrassing for somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And... the steroids we gave him would have suppressed his immune system. If that was a fungus, he'd have 30 aneurysms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Somebody's got a good point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>One bleed to four in less than 12 hours? That seems like an uptick to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to start him on antifungal meds before he drowns in his own blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>How long till it starts working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Give it a few hours. I’ll be back to check on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>There you go. Take it easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>You shouldn't have taken her there, you imbecile. They found nothing. You could have got your brains blown out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>You'd do it for me.  Ah. I... I should get going. Got the big man from Philly coming in tonight.  You want me to stay, I'll stay. Jimmy knows everything that we know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>No. The six months we put in on this... You gotta be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content> I'll swing by tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Hey, Eddie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Eddie</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I'm sorry. You know that... I can't go with you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It was all our fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We were screwing with Foreman, trying to make him think he made less than we did. Obviously, things got out of control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, someone does something stupid and insensitive, I always figure it was House. Good to know it's catching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Look, there is no other job. He was just trying to get a raise. Even if you gave him a little more money, I know he'd stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not giving Foreman a raise because the three of you decided to amuse yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We know, and that's why we want you to take it out of our paychecks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You two okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is there any other option?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're okay with it. Foreman is a good team leader. He deserves it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay, then. That is what I will do. And just so you know... I have no idea what you're talking about. I haven't seen Foreman in three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The phrase "who's your daddy?" comes to mind.</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content> Want to grab some coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kind of a bad time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Sorry. Uh, you told me to drop by, so... This is when I could make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right.  This whole thing with Wilson... It's all my fault. We're not closeted, because we're not gay.  For real.  Wilson thought you were cute, and I was just yanking his chain. Maybe that's not the best phrasing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>So you were only spending time with me to screw with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God, no. I was spending time with you because I want to touch your boobs.  Enough to listen to Evita, twice. And I really hate Evita. That's how much I like your boobs.  Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.  Wilson... he's a really good guy. And he really likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Well, it's really... It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that.  And you're still trying to sleep with me. You know, maybe I will call him. It would serve you right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson's a jerk too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Nora</speaker><content>Well, at least he tried to do the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then...</content></utterance>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The aneurysms look mycotic, but they're not. They're inflammatory. Because this is not a fungal infection. The hypertension was a real symptom. You've been unwittingly treating it with beta blockers. You stopped taking them, and your blood pressure went up. It's Hughes-Stovin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Okay, so how – how do we treat this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> We don't. Hughes-Stovin is an autoimmune disease. Once it's this advanced, there's not much we can do. The aneurysms keep multiplying. Eventually... one of them will rupture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you die in the next day or so, I will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Even if you had told us everything we wanted to know, it wouldn't have made a difference. You did the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I think I should call my wife now.</content></utterance>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm sorry about your patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He died a hero in his own mind. Guess it's better than nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ran into Nora in the elevator. She no longer thinks we're gay. Now she thinks we're mendacious dirt bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mendacious dirt bag comes much more naturally to me. Least we can get rid of that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I kind of like it.  Unlike this sofa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's 500 bucks. And...  it reclines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I will punch you in the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No chance.</content></utterance>
