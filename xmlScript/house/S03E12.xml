<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then why'd you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Because if you told the truth, I was gonna give you only one day of clinic duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That's dishonest. In refuse to participate in this...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You'll be assigned a doctor, who is not me, 'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> House! You're doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>EAR GUY</speaker><content> It hurts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>NURSE</speaker><content> Sir...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Call security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, I'm good, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>EAR GUY</speaker><content> Head on fire!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Need a team here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>MARKO</speaker><content>I have the sedative!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Little late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Just in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>What did you give him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Paralytic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Why would you do that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Somebody had to stop the screaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Then he's still in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah! But quietly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think the latter choice is better for all three of us.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> He's sedated. It took five cc's of haliperidol to get him down after the paralytic wore off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, pain in his right ear, psychotic behaviour and dizziness. Go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Nurses said he was holding his head. How d'you know it was specifically his ear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because he was dizzy. Means the problem was affecting his inner ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Nurses said he was running in circles. Doesn't mean he was dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He wasn't running in circles. He was running in oblongs. Looked like a three-year-old kid drew them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Acoustic Neuroma that started a haemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>'Splains the pain, vertigo, everything. Get an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>If it explains everything, what...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It might not explain everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What if he was psychotic first? Then self-mutilated, damaged the ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Excellent. Need a complete psychiatric work-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Uhh, I was... gonna say what Foreman...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, say something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> He... came to the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Goood...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Decent chance he had a chronic illness first, 'specially given the rapid heart rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Lingering ear infection. Pressure builds up in his inner ear, bursts through the</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a complete blood count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, while you're at it, pour some alcohol into his ear and take out the cockroach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He has a cockroach in his ear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> He was scratching that ear right before the event, so I took a peek. My guess is, it started biting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Nothing else wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wasn't that enough? Pretty gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>So, why are we doing the tests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty. Do the tests or just stay out of Cuddy's sight, I don't really care which.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Because it's not a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>It's a jogging park. You're not jogging. You can't jog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Watching jogging. I sit, I watch, I imagine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So... what do you watch for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> That guy's running in shorts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>He's not jogging, he's trolling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You're good at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>How long are you goin' to stay here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Beauty of this place is that it's the last place Cuddy will look.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>HOMELESS OLD GUY</speaker><content>The doctors gave me this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> What doctors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>HOMELESS OLD GUY</speaker><content>At the other hospital. Last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> Do you know what this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>HOMELESS OLD GUY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> "Patient has a six centimetre mass in the right lung. Cancerous. Inoperable." Do you understand what this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOMELESS OLD GUY</speaker><content>Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>HOMELESS OLD GUY</speaker><content>It's cold outside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>What're you doing here? Thought House had a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He doesn't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You ordered a CT on a patient with a bug in his ear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>How'd you know I was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Ran into Cameron in the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> "Ran into"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You ordered pointless tests just to...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wouldn't've been pointless if you didn't "run into" Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>She got punished. She's stuck with another dying patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Is that Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Breath mint. Thought you were gonna kiss me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>What happened to rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I got out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> It was a scam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Enough foreplay. You gonna kiss me or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You are going back to the clinic. Or jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You perjured yourself to keep me out of jail. How're you...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I only did that because I thought you were getting clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So it's do clinic duty or go to jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then it'll be finish your paperwork or go to jail. Help with fundraising or go to jail. Do your job or go to jail. I think I'd rather go to jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> You owe me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Bea-utiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content>Thank you. It's dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Who cares. It's beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If my lawn was half as well maintained as that, pigeons wouldn't have the nerve to poop on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content>Good grooming is important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Is that a shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content> People do judge you on your appearance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content>When you entered, I noted your shirt hadn't been pressed; you hadn't shaved in quite some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content>I extrapolated you were a person for whom detail is not a major concern. I was worried you might apply the same standard in your work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You use toe-nail clippers up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>SHERLOCK NOSE</speaker><content>They're longer, so they allow me to better reach the upper hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I am wearing a rumpled shirt, and I forgot to brush my hair this week. You've got athlete's foot in your nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I'm ready to be judged.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay! Fifty dollars...!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>...to any patient who's willing to leave here right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>My money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I don't care. People do not...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> They leave, fifty bucks. They're not all that sick. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Or they're poor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>And desperate. Which was why this place is here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If they're that poor, then they'd rather have fifty bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>OLD GUY</speaker><content> Can I have the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Look. It's monogrammed. He doesn't need money. Ergo, he's not sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>And the blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Could be anybody's. Monogram's definitely his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> We need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Doesn't matter what you say, do or threaten. I will find a way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>How can we make this more interesting for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>How can we make the sky green? How can we make the tall short? You cannot make the uninteresting interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> I'll pay you ten dollars for every patient you diagnose without touching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You pay me ten dollars for every one you have to touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're making this into a game for me. From which I can only conclude this isn't a game for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why? Think if I deal with enough people, I'll find some humanity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>STOMACH LADY</speaker><content>Feels rough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes! It's a rash. Can't get any more than "rough".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>STOMACH LADY</speaker><content> Well,  it's just rough. Can't you feel it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, I could. But then, what satisfaction would you get?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>PULSE DUDE</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No. But you will. Every patient who comes in here for an STD test has one thing in common. They had SWS. "Sex While Stupid".</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>Why don't you wanna treat me anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I never wanted to treat you. Fact that you were raped  holds no interest for me. It's nothing personal. There's nothing to treat. You're physically healthy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>True.  It's a life. And you should end it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Talk to me, don't quote me bumper stickers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>It's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's meaningless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>It means every life matters to God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not to me, not to you.  Judging by the number of natural disasters, not to God either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>You're just being argumentative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah! I do do that. What about Hitler? Is his life sacred to God? Father of your child? Is his life sacred to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>My child isn't Hitler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Either every life is sacred or...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content> Stop it! I don't wanna chat about philosophy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're not killing your rape baby because of a philosophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>It's murder! I'm against it. You for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not as a general rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-22"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>Just for unborn children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes!  The problem with exceptions to rules is the line drawn. Might makes sense for us to kill the ass that did this to you. But where do we draw the line? Which asses do we get to kill? Which asses get to keep on being asses? Nice thing about the abortion debate is we can quibble over trimesters, but ultimately there's an ice-cold line - birth. Morally, there isn't a lot of difference. Practically, huge.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> This is the type of conversation I do well.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-27"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There are no answers.If there are no answers, why talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're healthy. You shouldn't be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-29"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content>I don't wanna go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sounds like an easy loophole.  People can do good things, but their instincts are not good. Either God doesn't exist or he's unimaginably cruel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content> I don't believe that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content> Maybe he was challenging me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He hurts you to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I guess it's better than he hates you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>EVE</speaker><content> You're trying to convince me there's no God! Why would you even say something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because you're throwing your life away.</content></utterance>
