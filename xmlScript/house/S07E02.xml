<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>Competed in the boys' league this year. Kicked their asses too. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>Nice job, Del. You—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>I went faster on the 50-50. You were right. All right, who wants a turn now? . Yeah, yeah, I'm a little biased.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Whoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>George </speaker><content>You got to see this. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>George </speaker><content>You made a great event today, hon. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Fast enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>I'm already in a wheelchair. What are you so afraid of? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>That wasn't what I meant. . Della? You okay? Mom! Dad!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We got to stop parking like this. People are gonna talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, that's why I plan on doing some talking first. . I want us to formally report our relationship to Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay. You get them, I'll cover everybody else. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I would appreciate it if we could keep it quiet until we had that meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's gonna be hard with me grabbing your ass all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Grabbing stops at the threshold... ... of the parking garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Handicapped plates. I got special access. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I just don't want our relationship affecting our jobs. Or the other way around. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I got a call about a case for you. 14-year-old. EMTs think her heart stopped—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You haven't seen it yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I sense something fascinating about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm seeing Cuddy. . Generally, without her clothes on. Use your imagination. Hope it's got a wide-angle lens. . You don't actually need that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>This is not a prank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>This is not me walking out the door. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Really? You and Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>For realz. Foreman can translate. So Junior Miss everything — skateboarder, basketballer, science clubber, seal clubber . I'm actually guessing with that last one. Healthy one day, heart arrhythmia the next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Are you sure it's a good idea to be yanking on the chain of command?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Interesting.  In favor, indignant, indifferent. Think I'd like a female perspective. Or Thirteen's. Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>She's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>She said she was taking a leave of absence. . Wanted us to think it was for a Huntington's study in Rome. They've never heard of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Cell and home phone are disconnected. Apartment's already been vacated. And what's with the death's head cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Three years, you've been trying to game out Thirteen. Now you don't care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sorry. Not caring about Thirteen is not part of the differential for heart arrhythmia, but you do get a home version of the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wouldn't be sudden onset. Foreman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Do you know something about Thirteen that we don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's entitled to her privacy. Just as I'm entitled to a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>And you're glossing over Thirteen's departure because you actually respect somebody's privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I agree. It's weird of me not to care. So either I'm a changed man because of Cuddy, or I'm pretending to be a changed man because I do know something about Thirteen and I'm trying to throw you off the scent, or I've just gone nutty bananas because I lost a patient. All of which you are free to discuss  after I get a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Scare the patient to death to confirm Long QT. . Fine. If you insist, do it in a room with one of those thingamabobs that brings people back to life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Scare test is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Scare test is legitimate. Simulates real world conditions. This fling with Cuddy is insane. Flare gun? Scary enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>How about just telling her we're planning this stupid test? And I'm hoping House and Cuddy are more than just a fling. It's clearly mellowed him out. He didn't even care about Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Right. The guy who ordered us to stop the patient's heart has mellowed out. It's gonna be horrible because it's doomed, which is just gonna make House 50 times more of a crank. . Firecrackers! We can hide 'em under one of those covered food trays. .</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Find any itching powder in your hanky? Any fake poo in your desk drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Yes, the lack of dime-store pranks is proof that you're actually dating Cuddy, and not just mocking me for being worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You told everybody, didn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Repeatedly. This one's not buying it. Need a little help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm not selling it. It's time for our meeting at Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House, you've been to Human Resources 74 times in the last six weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Never after doing this. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Well, I'm convinced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I – hey, I'm not even...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cudddy </speaker><content>If I confirm it, can we leave?</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>HR guy </speaker><content>How would you describe the exact nature of the relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>It's a sexual relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Go slowly now. He's writing it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I believe that I can still supervise Dr. House effectively, but we both want to follow hospital policy to the letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HR guy </speaker><content>Our concern is to make sure that there's no conflict of interest, no liability for the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House. Let him talk. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HR guy </speaker><content>I, uh, know that you're not going to sue, because you are both going to sign love contracts. . Consensual relationship agreements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HR guy </speaker><content>Uh, we'll also need to watch for any favoritism toward Dr. House. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Does that mean she has to sleep with everyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>There's got to be a joke there about keeping up with inflation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>HR guy </speaker><content>Or bias against him. Are there any supervisory issues with Dr. House's current case load?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, her case is solved. Patient has Long QT. Gonna scare her into cardiac arrest to confirm it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>No, we're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay, no, we're not. . See? Everything's under control. .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I know you're still planning your ridiculous scare test. The patient is nowhere near sick enough to justify the risk. An angiogram and an E.P. study are much safer and very effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fair point. Not doing the scare test. . I'd invite you to watch me not doing the test, but having not done it many times before, trust me, it's pretty not interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Scare test was not approved. Do an angio and E.P. study instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>First of all, that's not as effective as— .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>George </speaker><content>How come you're not doing the more specialized test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>This test is virtually just as effective. And Dr. House puts a premium on patient safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Hugo </speaker><content>But frequently changes his mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Hugo, give him a break. I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You should go to the bathroom before we go. We've been hydrating you for quite a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>I don't have to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Once we start the test, you won't be able to move for at least an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>I really don't have to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>How much fluid have we given her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Last night, I guess. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Claire </speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Your daughter's kidneys seem to be failing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>House, I was expecting your relationship with Cuddy to complicate our work long-term. . I am now concerned it might be affecting us short-term. All due respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>None taken. I listen to Cuddy all the time. She's my boss. Also yours, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You'd listen, then tell her she's being an idiot, and do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I find I can skip the idiot part when she's not being an idiot, and since the scare test would have led to the same dead end, she was right to stop it. Which means your problem's about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>This should be interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Losers love company. And if even a misanthrope like me has a chance at happiness, it's gonna be pretty lonely on that landfill of loserdom you call a marriage. . Heart, kidneys, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Could be Fabry disease. Lipid deposition in her tissues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Dad's history was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What about protein deposits? They wouldn't show in her parents' history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Amyloidosis. Explains both the symptoms. Marrow transplant to treat. Brother's a match.  Confirm and do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that you're... 102 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>102-year-old ox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>He has tingling in his feet and his legs. I want a full battery of tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Carbon dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>I'll pay cash if it's not covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's nice of you to float your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>He's not my friend. He's my father. He's 22 years older than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Maurice </speaker><content>Do the tests. I'm sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You have a bad case of natural causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If the vial fills with sand, we take that as a bad sign.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Hugo should be here. Why'd you ask him to leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We wanted to be able to discuss this openly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>But it obviously affects him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Calire </speaker><content>Honey, let the doctor finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's a standard procedure. We use general anesthesia, harvest a very small amount of—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>No. I'm not taking my brother's marrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>George </speaker><content>Del, it's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>These harvests are harmless. With the meds we give, there's almost no pain, almost no risk of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>Almost? His life's hard enough as it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Small problem with the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Patient won't take marrow from steel wheels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We're finding another match. And how do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What other problem could there be with a problem-free procedure? Boy's sports, science club, she's living his life, not hers. . Makes sense she's being a self-denying moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>She loves her brother. She's thinking selflessly. How is that at all—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You're right. If everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>See? I can skip the idiot part when you're not being an idiot. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, I had that same facial expression for the first 48 hours. Had another one too, but only for 15 seconds at a time. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I'm happy for you. You're happy for you. This is huge. So who's gonna supervise you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Well, I guess maybe that can work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Maybe? Nothing's changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You showed up for clinic hours. . Voluntarily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House, everything's changed. You're sleeping together. You want something from her besides a sign-off on scaring your patient to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You talked to Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>He's worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He's a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I'm worried too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Do I need to say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>I want this to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm not doing anything differently. She changed my mind about one diagnostic test. And she was right. . Even though it's your emotional default, stop worrying. . I can handle it. .</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I hear you're a pretty fierce skateboarder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>All your activities, don't they seem like things a 16-year-old boy would do? Some people might think you're trying to live his life for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>And you're not worried you're being selfless to the point of self-denial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>You've never been inspired by someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Why don't you take your pills? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Hemothorax. We need to bronch her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Clear an O.R. She's drowning in her own blood.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's bleeding to death. Out of her lung. I want to fill a quarter of it with foam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>That'd stop the bleeding, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Thought it made more sense than diet and exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>And if she doesn't have enough lung function left, you'll have killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You're right. Faster and riskier's better. Foam the lung. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Got a green light?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>It's not completely bad, House. You care enough to pull your punches. That's not a bad thing. But you and Cuddy have got to figure out a way of avoiding this problem. Set some ground rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah . I have to avoid this problem. If I can restrict our interactions to places where neither of us are wearing pants...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Yeah, that's not avoiding the problem, that's avoiding the issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Since avoidance is my plan for dealing with the issue, technically, that's not avoiding it. . Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>No problem. .</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hey, you've been on me for years to respect someone's opinion . Just 'cause I had to go outside this group to find one I respect. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Multi-system involvement centered in the lung. Sarcoidosis?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What about Goodpasture's? Affects the lungs, kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And autoimmune explains the out of the blue arrhythmia. Goodpasture's it is. Immunosuppressants and plasmapheresis to treat, kidney biopsy to confirm. .</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, so tell him. He's a big boy now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>I can't. I'm his whole life. But if it comes from a doctor... .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's very generous. When you were 30.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cuddy and I are naked. So I'm having trouble focusing. Use small words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You lost me. Sorry, who is this calling again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's not Goodpasture's. There's intimal thickening of the blood vessels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And lymphocytic infiltrate. We tested for LAM. It's positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Plus her lung's fried. She needs a donor lung to live, which is the only treatment for LAM, anyway.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Surgery was uneventful, but the donor lung started failing about an hour into recovery.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>We know we're right about LAM. Tests confirmed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That leaves us with two options. Body's rejecting the new lung or we should have rejected the new lung because it's infected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Let's biopsy, see which one it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No guarantee we'd hit the affected spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>If we give steroids for rejection, it'd make an infection worse. If we give antibiotics for infection, it'd make rejection worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Which worse is worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>If we treat for infection and we're wrong, she'll be dead within hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And if we treat for rejection and we're wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>She'll probably hang on a day or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You're assuming her rejection's hyperacute. Odds are, it isn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Gotta head off the worst worse first. I studied under Dr. Seuss. Start with IV methylprednisolone for hyperacute rejection. If that fails, we'll switch her to broad-spectrum antibiotics and hope we're not too late. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Cat got your legs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fine. You do it. . Tell her she's being an idiot for always choosing the safer course. She's sitting on her ample, if well-formed, bureaucratic ass while our patient's dying. We'll see who folds like an origami shrimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>You want me to get Cuddy's approval?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Be our little secret. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I was relaying your words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I needed to be aggressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>She was siding with Foreman's analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>The odds are against it being hyperacute rejection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Stop. I agree with you . That was our analysis from the start.  If you've got a problem with a team decision, you come to me.  I'm sorry. I-I'll deal with him later.  I said well-formed. .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Let's give the antibiotics at least another hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Amazing. And House hasn't given you one ounce of grief for your complete lack of interest in his love life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Did it ever occur to you that House is just happy and could give a crap about other people's lives because of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Well, that's ironic and depressing. And by that logic, the reason you don't give a crap is because you're happy, which means you've got someone new giving you chew toys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You're one-fourth right.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>BP's dropping. Means the antibiotics aren't working.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>George </speaker><content>Can you save the lung?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Believe it or not, we got a better chance now. This means rejection, not infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Start her on IV methylprednisolone right away.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Wow. You hate salad. She's really got you tied up in knots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>What you need is a plan that you actually develop with Cuddy. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Antibiotics didn't work and then steroids didn't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>The new lung's ruined, and it's not rejection or infection. The only two options were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Unless it's not LAM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It is LAM. The tests were positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Then the tests have to be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, it was here when I sat down. I need to think. .</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Damage has a way of spreading to everyone around you. For example, your obvious emotional damage is now making me have a philosophical conversation instead of dealing with your sister. See how that might be damaging? . Never?</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>When was the last time you had a cold? Any minor aches, swelling, anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Claire </speaker><content>It's been years. She never gets colds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I didn't ask when's the last time she mentioned it. I asked when she had one — even a tiny one. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>It's nothing. Sometimes my ears ache a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>M–my chest... Soreness. Some congestion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>George </speaker><content>You never said anything about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>I barely noticed it until that skateboarding tournament in Denver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>How long ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Della </speaker><content>A... year? Cold's nothing when I think of what Hugo goes through every day. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, we get it. Your brother, the Saint. His sister, the Martyr. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Thank God you followed me. Now you can go back to the transplant committee while I get confirmation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Confirmation of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What causes low-level cold symptoms for a year, can ruin two lungs, is immune to drug therapies, and gets worse in cities nicknamed “Mile-High”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>A clotting disorder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She has a nasty case of sickle cell trait. Her heart arrhythmia wasn't sudden at all. Screwed-up blood cells screwed-up the blood vessels, which gave us a screwed-up positive for LAM. If she'd told us about her symptoms sooner — like ever — she might not be dying. You were right after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I never said sickle—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>So she's gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Unless we can find—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>She burned through one donor lung. Transplant committee's never gonna give her a second one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, then I guess you're right again.  Unless we don't need their approval.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You can't advise your patient's parents to take marrow and half a lung from their son!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I guess I can just chat with them about the weather. Blood tests just confirmed sickle cell trait. So they might be curious about the only treatment option. Though we are having weird weather lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>There is a huge reason not to take lungs from living patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So their siblings can die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Their son has CMD. As it is, he's gonna die of respiratory failure by 25. We could cut whatever time he has left in half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That qualifies as a bad reason for them to reject the idea. It's a much worse reason for them not to get the choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>It's coercive to tell them! You ever hear of "do no harm"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That was second year, right? 'Cause I had mono all that fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Their son's not even our patient. Why don't we just take half a lung from some guy in the clinic with a toothache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That's a great idea. Now we can give the parents two options.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Okay? Seriously! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You made an argument. If you don't want me to defer to you, why make it at all?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I've got your... test results. . You have the metabolism, blood counts, liver and kidney function of a 92-year-old. Which is great, 'cause you're 102. What's not so great is the average life expectancy is 78. It is my recommendation that you move into a home with round-the-clock care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>Oh... I can't believe it! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Maurice </speaker><content>Can't my son give me round-the-clock care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Not unless you've done your two-year certification in tiburon swab technology. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>There must be some other way. Just because he has a little tingling and some trouble feeling hot and cold and some difficulty—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You can't feel hot and cold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Maurice </speaker><content>Not lately. But at my age...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Show me your teeth. . Dentures. Fairly worn. I'm guessing ten years old. . Show me your denture cream. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>Why would he carry denture cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Because... . He has... zinc poisoning. But to get it from denture cream, he'd have to take so much of it — trust me, he never leaves home without it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Sidney </speaker><content>How much do you use, pop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Maurice </speaker><content>About a tube a day. I buy it online . So what does this mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Bizarrely, it explains all your symptoms. Better-fitting dentures, you'll be fine. Medically, there's no reason to go anywhere. . Hospital rebate. You might wanna... put it towards couples therapy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>George </speaker><content>The transplant committee's... never gonna give my daughter another lung, are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>George </speaker><content>Looking into what? Please. Tell me. Give me some kind of hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm afraid I can't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We can take marrow and half a lung from your son. It would likely shorten his life significantly. He'd never be able to go on a respirator if he needed to. Most people with CMD need to as their respiratory function declines.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Because you're unsupervisable, House. Two department chairs threatened to quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, I guess we're stuck with each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I have no idea why I'm making this call, or if it's the right call to make. But if you feel strongly about presenting the parents your treatment option, you can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Houses </speaker><content>Thank you, I will.  Several hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You told them?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>What do you mean, put it on? It is on them! As much as they may wanna pass the lung here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Of course they do! You're handing them an impossible choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Life has handed them a crappy choice, and they're picking the crappier option — trading who knows how many healthy decades for four or five years in which roller boy will be a limp rag.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Their son is a human being. You know what they are, right? Intrinsic value. We don't get to decide—</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-24"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>He needs to keep the one he's got. You don't get to play God by ripping out—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-25"><speaker>House </speaker><content>That train left the station when we learned to do transplants. The rest is just paper-pushing. Of course, now we're on to your real area of expertise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-26"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Oh, I thought we were moving on to yours — bullying your patients into embracing your own lack of a moral— .</content></utterance>
