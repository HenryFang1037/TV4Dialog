<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>It's Tom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>Tom, your husband? What's he doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Uh, what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to be here, but Evelyn's school contract's due tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>I knew I was forgetting something. Let me, uh, find a pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Not quite sure what Emily Post recommends in this situation, but I'm Tom. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>Damien.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Sorry to intrude.  I just—I wasn't quite sure when she'd be coming home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Thank you so much for catching this. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, I'll get out of your way, it was good to meet you, and I'll see you later, hon. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>So… seems like a nice guy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>You still go to Mickey's? What's your cholesterol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's my one vice. I'm keeping it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>As much as I would love to clog my arteries, I have a 10 o’clock CT and I still have to race home, get changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's just trying to get into your skirts. And I don't mean metaphorically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Well, he's got the legs for it.  So I will see you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Bye, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have a nice day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said I'd stay out of it. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Clearly, SOMETHING. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, on a list of your attributes, there's nothing that even rhymes with "coy."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I may have seen something in the fridge. Like the end of your relationship.  She put the milk in the door and not on the shelf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You hate that she did that, but you didn't say anything. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're trying to get us to fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I'm trying to help. If you got an issue, let her know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I should have known that you weren't done sabotaging this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Stew in your irritation. And sure, last time it bubbled over into resentment and rage, leading ultimately to a painful divorce that neither of you ever really recovered from, but I'm sure this time it'll be great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Interesting case. 35-year-old woman with fever and abdominal pain. E.R. ruled out all the usual suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And she's in an open marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Animals also eat their young and kill their rivals. That make it weird that most of us don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over how many women who aren't his wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Our patient's unhappy because she's suffering from an intestinal blockage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boring. Then we have to find a reason to rule it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about herpes colitis? She picks up the infection from one of her partners. It takes root in her colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>STD panel was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Chances are, this couple was unhappy in the first place. This is their attempt to save something that never— . Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Herpes might not register if she was exposed in the last six weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But it would show up on a barium enema. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wait. You're gonna do it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Barium coats the inner lining of your colon. Lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>I can get somebody else to pick up Evelyn. I feel like I'm abandoning you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>I'm on painkillers. I'd rather this not be what you think of every time you look at my butt. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, roll onto your side. It's fill 'er up time. So is Evelyn his new squeeze?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>She's our daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>She's six. She knows as much about our sex life as any other kid her age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>You've been in the room five minutes. You got us all figured out. Of course, you left out the part where we love each other and we want to grow old together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you just don't want to be young together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tank's full. I'll page the radiology elves.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Maya</speaker><content>I'm not saying I hate it. Just doesn't go with your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You hate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Maya</speaker><content>Little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Any more heartless critiques of my general appearance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Maya</speaker><content>Nope. All done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maya and I are just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, you and I are friends and you don't have coffee with me three times a week. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's an interesting person. She grew up in Ohio. She has three brothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Fascinating. Last week, that Cambodian lab tech was telling us how he survived the Killing Fields and you left to go get a donut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So we flirt. It's fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's dangerous. That woman would totally do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>All I'm saying is if you want to be on a diet, you might want to stop hanging out by the dessert cart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It stopped hurting during the X-ray, which means it was just an intestinal blockage that passed. We should discharge her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. There's no need to find any underlying cause 'cause these things never happen twice. Take her digestive system for a test drive. Give her a radio-opaque milkshake. X-ray every 15 minutes to see if it makes any unscheduled stops on the way through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll be here all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, Taub will be here all night. Talk to the unicorn and then tell me you don't believe. .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I did an abdominal CT on a kid today and found a six-inch bezoar made entirely of gum. I mean, who gives a three-year-old an endless supply of g— You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I mean, there was hair in it and maybe a piece of paper.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So… how long you been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>One of the few drawbacks of having an open marriage. Nobody ever asks me about current events or the weather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yankees look good this season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And, uh, how long have you – you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>After three years, we realized that traditional marriage was making us both miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Most people get divorced at that point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Yeah, we didn't want to get divorced. We still loved each other. We just realized that expecting one person to fulfill all of your needs forever is unrealistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There are happy monogamous couples out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Sure. One or two have the perfect marriage. Everybody else has figured out how to settle for less. I don't want to settle and end up resenting my husband. I'd rather get the 10% he doesn't give me somewhere else so that I can really appreciate him for the 90% he does. . I think something's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>With your stomach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>My heart is racing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Try to take deep breaths. I'm going to try to slow your heart down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Is this because of the blockage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. It's not working. Need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I need a list of all your sexual partners from the last six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your wife had an arrhythmia. The progression of symptoms from bowel to heart makes a parasitic infection most likely. Since Julia hasn't been out of the country—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>The only place that I've been recently is a business trip to Nebraska.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But either of you could have picked up a bug from one of your partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>It's kind of… complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How many partners are we talking about? Ballpark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So why not just tell her that and close this whole thing up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>You married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I – I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Did you ever agree to go see a chick flick with your wife or pretend to enjoy classical music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stravinsky never groped my wife in a midtown hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>She needs this. I don't. But I don't want her to feel bad about that. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Guy's got a license to drill. Why would he lie about not using it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not the lie. The lie is that he gives a crap about how his wife feels. If they're both screwing around, that's one thing. But if she has a piece on the side and he doesn't, the only way he'd be okay with that is if he's betraying her in some other way that, in his mind, makes them even. My unicorn isn't a unicorn. It's a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. Even the guy who's not cheating is doing it for underhanded reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, no, no. He's not being cynical. He's assuming the husband is doing something to even the score, which means he thinks there is a score, which means, cheating swans aside, House believes in monogamy. He's being romantic. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What I believe is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous. Doesn't matter if I think there's a score. I guarantee you he does. Any of the wife's partners pan out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's been with two people other than Tom in the last six months. Neither of them have been outside the tri-state area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we're back to the husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You just said you believed—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's doing something behind her back. What better cover than a business trip to Nebraska? Like that's really a place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Let's find his travel records and get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You seem pretty mellow about this couple's deal. Thought you'd be first in line to shake a finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They're still married. I'm not. Not that I could ever do it. I was jealous of House and Cameron never touched him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Not counting the emotional fondling. . When my mom was dying, my dad had an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He told you this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'd seen them get out of his car. Two years after mom died, they got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That must have sucked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>At the time, yeah. But looking back… It makes sense. My mom never knew about it and he needed someone to make him feel less alone. He took care of my mom day in and day out for two and a half years before she died. He was devoted to her. Loving someone else didn't change that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So loving two people at once is fine as long as one of them is dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Whoever's taking care of me when I get sick, I hope they've got someone else to take care of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tom was telling the truth. He really did go to Nebraska. Plane ticket and restaurant seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Forget Nebraska. . Maybe they just bought their parasites at the mall.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You know, we should really throw away that loofah. They're imported. Sometimes they're not sterilized. We think our patient got amoebiasis from hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is she gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're treating now. She should be fine. It's actually kind of bizarre. She and her husband have an open marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>They sleep with other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, she does. Her husband's totally fine with it. I mean, it's crazy, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And you're bringing this up because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I thought it was interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>More interesting than your other cases, I guess. I mean, you talk about your colleagues, you rant about House. You don't usually mention your patients. Is open marriage something you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. I mean… I know you'd never…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay. There's a woman at work. People say she's attracted to me, but nothing's happened. Nothing's going to happen. I'm not having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, honey. I'm trying to be honest. I don't want to make the same mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Be honest then. Are you attracted to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Look… she's attractive. There's an attraction. Aren't there men who make you feel that way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Of course there are, but it never occurs to me to act on it because- because I'm married… to you. And that's enough for me. Aren't I enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Of course you are.  Our patient's lost all movement in her legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There are other doctors, Chris. We're talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm sorry. The woman's paralyzed. I'll get a cab.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tests show no spinal cord injury, no cerebral lesions, no hemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Finally got a stool sample. The loofah's innocent. No sign of amoebas or any other parasites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So paralysis, arrhythmia, and intermittent abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And he nicked himself shaving. Sorry. That was Taub. But it was easier to solve. Means he used the crappy razor in his locker, which means he slept here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thanks to you. I brought up open marriage with Rachel. It was a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the medical front, we've knocked out sex and foreign travel. Could be an electrolyte imbalance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So the only time you're not interested in my marriage is after you blow it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Houses</speaker><content>You're the moron who took marital advice from Tila Tequila.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You pushed me into this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest. Either way, you win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We've ruled out sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We ruled out sex with other people. Tom said he and Julia have been doing it three or four times a week and she's got boys on the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Increased libido can be a symptom of adrenocortical carcinoma, which also explains her other symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just because everybody in this room wishes that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so.  Get an MRI of her adrenal glands.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Hi. Okay if I take the sports page?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Would you mind using a coaster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Oh. Sure. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's okay. . Also, it'd be great if you'd replace the toilet paper when you finish a roll. And when you load the dishwasher, you can't put a big, flat bowl on the bottom. . It traps the water so nothing on the top gets clean. And please don't throw banana peels in the bedroom trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I haven't done any of those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're probably not even aware of—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I hate bananas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Why would he think that stuff would make us fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because of the milk. You put it in the door. The body of the refrigerator is the coldest part. The temperature in the door fluctuates, which decreases shelf life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just want clean dishes and unspoiled milk so we can all stay healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Oh, it's about health. What about the coaster? Does that replenish my B-12 or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Can we just drop it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Sure. . You have this list of annoyances the entire time we were married?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Dr. Hadley, did you say there was a video game in the playroom?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Get out of my wife's room. Your relationship with her stays out of our space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>I was worried about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Tom's right. You should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Damien</speaker><content>So it's fine if we have sex, but if I drop by to see if you're okay—</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>How hard is it to ask me not to put them in the dryer? And I only did your laundry because you were never home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn't ask you to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Of course you didn't. You just got annoyed whenever you didn't have clean underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I never said I was annoyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>That's the point. You didn't say anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Conversation sort of got away from me. It was a train wreck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think it's good you brought it up. I read a study that found men who have multiple copies of a certain vasopressin receptor are twice as likely to be unfaithful. Maybe you're just one of those guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So my cheating is biologically predetermined? . Fantastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Multiply times five. We need a better look at the medulla. I thought you'd be relieved. This gets you off the hook. It's just genetics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's because being short and bald doesn't hurt anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There's nothing there. It's not adrenal cancer. And maybe you're right about me. But I'm not gonna stop trying. Rachel's worth it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You served me with divorce papers in the middle of a medical conference in New Orleans . I threw a bottle into an antique mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Oh, you exhibited an emotion? I wish I'd known you were capable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I loved you. I thought I was gonna be following you to Baltimore, remember? . I called about apartments. I set up interviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe because I was working two jobs to support us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was killing myself so that you could take that non-paying internship—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Expressing yourself does not make you the bad guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>VQ scan confirmed the spot on Julia's lung was a clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If he has a secret, I highly doubt it's more relevant than the clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clotting disorder would explain everything.  Question is, which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you read any of your departmental memos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only the ones labeled, "n-s-f-w."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, that's "n-n-s-f-w."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Julia's got insurance. I saw the policy number on the form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But the policy lapsed due to non-payment. I already made three calls about this.  You should have been aware of that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Why the retirement account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll just give you a few minutes to— .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By "we," she means "she." .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>I lost all of our savings. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Thirteen enters</speaker><content>I started her on heparin to prevent further clots, but we still don't know what's going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's not medically relevant. You're not gonna care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson's been teaching me how to care. Try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He builds wind turbines and leases them out to local power companies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. I don't care. . Clotting disorder: DIC. Factor five leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Vitamin K deficiency also fits. Causes thrombophilia and is consistent with abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Congratulations, House. Sam ended it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go test our patient's blood…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But it can wait five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>… for everything we discussed.  I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Or you could have stayed out of it. I could have kept my mouth shut, been annoyed sometimes, but I'd be happy, because I'd still be with her. . Now all I have is cold milk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As long as you're free, you want to grab some dinner? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Did Tom go home for the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>For starters. I told him to leave. I don't want him here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Money is a complicated subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Yeah, it's not the money. I mean, the — the money's bad, but…  When we first opened our marriage, I got involved with a guy who lied about being single. Then one day, his wife calls me. She's crying and screaming and totally out of control. And I felt… superior. I thought I don't ever have to worry about feeling this way because Tom and I are honest with each other. Well, here I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hi. Sorry I didn't make it home last night. I needed to run some tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I told you nothing's going—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you giving me permission to sleep with other women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I want you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tomorrow's Thursday.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>All our tests came back negative. It's not a clotting disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means we need to come up with a better idea. So what causes problems in the stomach, heart, nerves? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You know what it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mazel Tov?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No sign of schistocytes or hemolysis. So you're actually going to sleep with another woman then go home to your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Taub was gonna do all of that anyway. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery. Here's a thought —  Taub's wife is now totally on the market. Mind hitting me with her digits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She would love that, but duty calls.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>My stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Same pain as before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Yeah, but worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get the portable ultrasound in here. We need to get a look at her belly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pain, pain went away, came back another day. Question is, what brought it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Physical exam was unrevealing. Ultrasound was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient. Abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6. Taub turns back into a faithful pumpkin at midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because lying alone in a hospital bed contemplating bankruptcy — hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My point was that arousal is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system. If that's where the problem is, the pain could be triggered by crying, which seems—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>PNS also controls digestion, which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What if what matters isn't when the pain started, but when it stopped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was during an X-ray. You think that cured her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, but House prepped her for the X-ray with a barium enema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, that wouldn't treat anything except—</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're in pain because part of your intestine folded in on itself. It's called an intussusception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's cutting off blood flow. We need to fix it before your bowel gets necrotic and dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Once you do that, will I get better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When this happens in adults, it's usually a sign of abdominal cancer. We'll fix the overlap, and then search your intestine for tumors.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have a bad feeling about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing. That's the beauty. I genuinely tried to help Wilson. I told him to stand up for himself, which you know is legitimate advice. And his relationship blew up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So you're paying it forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex, so be it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Think I should wear a tie tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This isn't weird at all. I mean, where's Rachel eating tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if she's going out too? She is allowed to, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Of course. It's only fair. But I don't think she will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Operating Nurse</speaker><content>Your wife only eats dinner at home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If she did go out, that would be tough, but I think I can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don't do it unless you're sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know I'd rather be jealous than a liar.  Got something here. Kelly clamp and scalpel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Biopsy showed non-specific inflammation, which suggests IBD, only it doesn't explain the cardiac problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or her declining kidney function. We ran panels during surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, IBD does make sense, 'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis, which would explain the heart and the kidneys. Start her on sulfasalazine and TNF inhibitors.  Oh, and Taub, I'm not gonna see you before you head off for Gomorrah. Just remember, if you get disoriented… breathe through your nose and look for the horizon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Nothing's happened. It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. I've been an idiot, and I don't need anything else. I just need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You mean that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I do. I love you, Rachel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I love you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let's go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There are other doctors. .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The treatment's not working. Her left kidney failed last night. The other one's right behind it. It's not ankylosing spondylitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidney biopsy showed she had IgA nephropathy, which could be caused by or associated with  any of these conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We've gone from too few ideas to too many, and our patient's running out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why the lack of afterglow? Physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I went home with my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I can't hurt Rachel like that. Sickle cell anemia would have shown on blood tests. No flattened intestinal villi rules out celiac.  Seriously? Our patient's dying, and we can't move past my sex life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously, you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Alport and anti-GbM antibody are both untreatable, so if she has them we can't help her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And it can't be Henoch-Schonlein purpura.  No inciting respiratory infection and no rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Well, everything left on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hemochromatosis is a possibility. Excess iron builds up, causes problems throughout the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Weil's syndrome also affects multiple organ systems, and it wouldn't have been treated by the antibiotic the E.R. gave her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sarcoidosis makes sense too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Treat for those three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think you should call Tom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Am I gonna die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>If he walked in here right now, I'd look in his face and all I would think is "liar".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't you think that's kind of unfair? You say honesty's all-important, but you conveniently ignore the truth that some truths hurt people. Tom lied to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>He was covering his ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm not talking about the money. Tom hasn't slept with anyone else in over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>He told you that?  So my entire marriage is a sham?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. Your husband, who only wants you, lied so that you could be happy. That seems pretty real to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Me too. I shouldn't have said—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm trying.  I always thought that I was keeping the peace, but I was just resenting you and giving you a reason to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I wish we had this fight ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is it okay if we don't give House the credit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Oh, I recommend it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>"O" for three. Her kidney function is still declining. We're gonna need to start dialysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Glad the husband's back. After missing so many little deaths, he should be here for the big one. Top six, anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Polyarteritis nodosa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We'd have seen some improvement on prednisone.  Guy's wife's dying, and he stops to buy flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>They're from his garden. Mercury poisoning fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those are lilacs. My mom used to grow lilacs. My dad made her get rid of them, 'cause there were too many bees. We ruled out HSP 'cause there was no inciting respiratory infection. But in rare cases, it can also be triggered by a bee sting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We also ruled it out because there's no rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe we just didn't see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you been stung by a bee recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Uh, about a month ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not that you know of. Okay, I'm gonna have to check your holes. I'll start with the mouth. If there's nothing there, then things might have to get kinky. Say aah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Aah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was kinda hoping for kinky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>Tom</speaker><content>Is that good or bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll treat her with high-dose IVIG and cyclophosphamide. You should be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>I'm gonna be okay. I love you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That is adorable. Other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes, and him bankrupting your family, I think you kids are pretty much home free.</content></utterance>
