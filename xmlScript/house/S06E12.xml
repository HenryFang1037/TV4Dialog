<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>How am I supposed to walk into that meeting with no presentation? How the hell did you screw this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>It wasn't me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>She's lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>No, we agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>Her team had all the financials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> And we were swamped modeling them. That's why we agreed that you would do the slides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>Well, one of you screwed up, so please try to figure it out, 'cause when the client dumps me, I need to know who to fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Look, I confirmed it in an email. Hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content> She did tell you about it, Russ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>I… I never got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Russ, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>Are you drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>I'm not drunk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh! Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>I'm not drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I had no idea he was drinking again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>Well, you should have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Give me five minutes. I'll go to the business center and print the graphs directly from the spreadsheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>Run. And bring me some paper towels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Ah! Ow! Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Ah! Ah! Oh, it hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Norris</speaker><content>Don't tell me you were drinking too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>No. Ah! My ears. Oh my God. Oh. Ohhhhh.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>27 year old female intense, intermittent ear pains, saw six doctors…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell her to stop lurking in the front row. If she wants to hit on musicians that's what tour buses are for. Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If I ask why were in Wilson's office is there any chance I'll get a straight answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try it. Try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>14-year-old boy, joint pain and excess hair growth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell him to masturbate, no more than 3 times daily. With meals. Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Did I mention that the 27-year-old female is really hot. And her husband is really not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wild guess, he's rich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not unless social workers have begun pulling in the big money recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Gimme...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're taking the case because she's hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that would be an accident of genetics. It's because she's hot and her husband is ugly. It's a fascinating window into the mysteries of human psychology. Also, she's really hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or... She, you know, loves her husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She loves something about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Vitamin deficiency? She changed her diet a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To a healthier diet, raw foods, lots of nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not the ear, it's the heart. Her protein is cheese, which can raise cholesterol. Hers was already elevated. Gave her arterial blockages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, beauty and the beast.  Who wants to go see? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Let's see – Dr. Taub, Foreman, Chase, and Hadley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Four for four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Wow, I can't believe I get all these doctors, and such good-looking ones too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah. It's almost like we don't all need to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your case presented a very interesting diagnostic challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You can't sleep in your own office? Or bedroom for that matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Got to avoid my natural habitat. Some idiot I went to med school with keeps leaving messages and wants to drop by for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So tell him no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's too complicated for you to tell someone you don't like, to screw off? That's practically your hobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A few months ago he was... sort of part of my therapy. My shrink told me to write a letter of apology to someone I hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> And how did you hurt him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics. I switched my final paper with his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You plagiarized? Doesn't sound like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was testing a theory. I thought that our professor was biased against me. I assumed he'd get a high grade with my paper and I'd get a low grade with his. Interestingly, I was wrong. I got an "A.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you're in this mental hospital, delving into your subconscious, and this is who you choose to apologize to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of all the people in the world you've hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not everyone has a name that's so easy to find in the white pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Um... I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. And yet, I picked him. It's funny, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yes, it's hilarious. Great to see what a success your therapy was. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We said we'd never go to sleep angry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We did find an arrhythmia. But it's not from your arteries. They're clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Will the pain come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll start her on cardiac meds. That should help. But we still need to figure out what's causing the arrhytmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content> Hey, Valerie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content> Russ. It's so nice of you to stop by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content> I got lots of free time now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>You don't blame me, do you? You were drunk in front of Norris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm drunk now. Then, it was like someone poisoned me or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe you should come back later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content> Okay. I just wanna say good-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Okay, Russ. Thank you for coming by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content> You poor son of a bitch. She doesn't love you any more than she loved me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Okay, you need to leave right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content> You're pretending you had an affair with my wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>Yeah, we're all pretending. You got nothing to worry about. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Tell him where you were six months ago, Russ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>I had a breakdown. I had some paranoid tendencies, as they say. But it turns out, I had a right, to be paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>You need help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Get him out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Russ</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content> Honey, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> Yeah, I'm okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We'll keep an eye out. He's not getting back into the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> He's making all that up. You know that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Yeah, of course.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Undisclosed location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Who are you hiding from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Wilson. And the lunch date that Wilson is, no doubt, right now trying to sic on me. But in the great game of chess that is our relationship, Wilson sees only one move ahead.  I see dozens. That is why he will never mate me.  That's a chess term.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's great. A co-worker confronted our patient. Altered mental status. Basically accused her of poisoning him. We think he was projecting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he's poisoning her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What could he get his hands on to cause supraventricular tachycardia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Does he have dry skin? Thin eyebrows? If you're sharing an amazed look, please do it louder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He might have. How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee, that would make her heart go boom.  In a bad way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We'll treat with beta blockers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry, but I totally disagree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>With everything. Why are we assuming he's lying and she's telling the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because she's a successful, happily married consultant, and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo who we just tossed out of the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And she's hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe she picked him because he's vulnerable. There's something off about her, I can feel it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you had any evidence, it would be –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why didn't she tell us a co-worker puked on her shoes right before she collapsed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because it's medically irrelevant. He was drunk, she was sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't think it's suspicious she didn't even mention it to her husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, Foreman. Why did you break up with Thirteen? Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing she was saying, why that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This is about the case, not some imaginary issue that you think Foreman and I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great, start her on beta blockers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You'll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't think he was talking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm the only one who thinks you're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe that's why I'm asking you to do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly. Dr. Wilson said you'd be here. How ya been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Check, and mate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>Look... I'm sorry this is awkward or whatever. I just thought it was nice of you to write that letter, and I wanted to tell you that you don't have to feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thanks. So where are you working these days? You got your own practice or you at a hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>I thought you knew. Dani's, the organic supermarket chain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As an in house doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>I actually never got licensed. I didn't graduate med school. I planned on going back, and then my father got sick and I had to take care of him and had some bad luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why didn't you graduate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>I was one credit short. And I was sort of already on academic probation. So...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which credit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>I got a, uh... He failed me on that paper you switched. I thought you knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So I'm guessing you're the CEO of this supermarket chain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>I bag groceries. Life works out weird sometimes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>We were gonna do it in Santa Barbara because of his parents. But then I found this beautiful hotel in Montauk and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You're testing her for a brain tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's what I told her. You can chastise me after you look at the monitor. Look what's lighting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lateral frontal cortex, Broca's area – so what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I told her it was customary to talk during MRIs, to relax. I spent the last 30 minutes asking her about everything in life that she loves, then hates, then feels any emotion about at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> There's nothing in the paralimbic system, amygdala.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because she's using the language part of her brain and bypassing the emotional. She can understand love and pain and empathy, but she can't feel them at all. She's a psychopath.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why do you want to meet her so badly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Psychopaths always fascinate me. I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values. Or is that Jews?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not gonna be able to get an honest read on her unless we figure out a way to get the husband out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm. I got an idea.  Can you get out of here? Thanks.  It was the "thanks" that did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long have you been a psychopath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> Are you kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Are you saying I'm like Ted Bundy or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Psychopathy can get a bad rap. It doesn't necessarily mean you're violent. Just that you're completely without conscience, you lack any normal emotion, you manipulate everyone around you, you're promiscuous, you lie pathologically. Any of this ringing bells?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> Is that why you were asking me all those weird questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah – though you have Darwin to thank for that. She got the creeps around you. Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths. Probably an evolved response to predators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I'm sorry, you're really freaking me out. I have no idea what –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. We have a duty of confidentiality. And you have an undiagnosed heart problem that could kill you at any moment. We believe that your mental abnormality is related to your physical one. So if you want to keep on predating...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> What do you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your co-worker's story was true. You poisoned him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>No. I gave him a little valium and an emetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure you understand what the word "no" means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I've had them both before, why can't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So you were just helping him out? And I assume he was cool with the whole seducing and firing part too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Russ knew what he was getting into. He got sex every Thursday night, and I got to take credit for his best ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And what are you getting out of your marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Same thing you get out of your job. Bill has a trust fund. And I have a prenup his parents made me sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told you he was rich. She's not that weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I'm not so different than anybody else. Everyone I've ever known – my family, my classmates, the people I work with. They're all out for themselves. Difference is, I could admit it to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She kind of reminds me of someone I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell me about it. Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces. How long have you been this way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Just how I am. Are you gonna cure my heart problems now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I thought you were bluffing to get information. You really think they're connected?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two rare conditions in one patient, it's a fair assumption they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Psychopathy is generally just genetic. Nothing you can do about it. Something that hits 30 years after birth isn't gonna be connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her disease isn't gonna lie dormant that long. Did her heart warp her brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe a handful of diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It'll be super awesome when we find it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tertiary syphilis can cause pseudopsychopathic syndrome and cardiomyopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fits best. Start her on penicillin, and rule out Wilson's and Hashimoto's. There's your handful. Wasn't so hard, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You've gotta do something about Thirteen. She flouted both my authority and yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, and she got it right and you got it wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which just aggravates the problem. She'll do it again. Next time it won't work out so well. You gotta punish her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're her boss. In some vague, never to be usefully defined way. You punish her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm also her ex, which, as you know, makes it a little complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little complicated to a little moronic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was the only way I could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wasn't because you were too in love with her. It was because you were too in love with your career. We're almost at my floor so I'll summarize. Your problem, not mine. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You cut up my only copy of that photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That rare daguerreotype. You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Not the one of me and Lucas. The one from Ecuador.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He was holding the camera. That was the last trip we ever took together. And I don't have a digital copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All I'm responsible for is the foreseeable consequences of switching papers. A bad grade or a sleepless night, worst case, a retest. There was no way to know that one seminar paper was gonna destroy this idiot's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If there's any karma in all this, he's probably happier than you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good point. If he's happier, there's no harm done. I'll go find out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Free time... Wouldn't have any of that if you were a doctor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>Yeah. That sugar maple, 100 - 150 years old. Most beautiful leaves in the fall. Sitting underneath on the bench – It's like paradise.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She might have caught it at birth. So it doesn't prove she was cheating. If you were worried about that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> Well, you should be. You let him know what I told you, I will not only have your license pulled, I will sue you for everything I lose in the divorce. So the fun you get out of making those snotty little comments, is it worth $19 million? Oh, wait, will you hold that look? I'm really bad at showing emotions. How's this? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Neither do I, but I know what happened after. She called Cuddy and demanded that I kick you off the case. I backed you up, because I trust you. But you're gonna have to earn that trust now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Actually, he backed you up because of the new B.U.N. creatinine numbers. Brittle bones were from kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There is that. So, heart and kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, psychopathy is not a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the meantime, kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Protein levels, kidneys, arrhythmia. Could be paraneoplastic. I'd say lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get her to radiotherapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can't start radiation without immunoassays on her urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Great, so you cast a spell and magically fix her kidney so she can give us some urine to test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We have some left over from admission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not enough for a completely accurate reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then how about partially accurate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those of you who haven't slept together, you can go. Everyone else, stay behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry.  That was our secret, right? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the lubricants. Just get me a receipt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We have zero feelings for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, that's too bad, 'cause things worked much better when you did. Would it help if I slept with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We were getting to a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, we were already at the diagnosis. You were creating a fake argument about an irrelevant treatment issue, 'cause you can't stand to be around each other. So have sex, fight or quit, I don't care. Whatever you're doing now isn't working. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Yeah. Look, I get that you gotta act fast – Radiation? You definitely ruled out everything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm sorry, but... We could still check for environmental toxins. Where does she spend most of her time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Mostly at work, at home –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hobbies? Recurring activities outside the home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>No, not really. She took a landscaping class, at the Y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When did it meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Every Thursday night this summer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You dig in soil, you can be exposed to pesticides, heavy metals, lots of bad things. Can you find out all about her landscaping class, where it was, details like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Yeah, I'll do it now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So when you watch Star Wars, which side do you root for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Dr. House. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just checking in on your radiotherapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>From what I hear, you never visit patients. And now, you've come to chat with me twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to know how you like being a management consultant. I'm thinking of getting into it. That or psychopathy maybe. Which pays better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I think you're already into one of them. Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday. She said I sound like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure you understand what “joke” means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>So you're not just out for yourself? For example, you would never interrupt a sick woman's treatment just because of some personal obsession?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I'm self-interested. We all are. We're born that way. The rest of us are born with consciences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Which is something you just sound ecstatic about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not saying it's logical. I'm just saying it's human.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>So if you know your conscience is just an animal instinct, you don't need to follow it. I think you realize that. That's why you're talking to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>You - You lied about your landscaping class. Dr. Hadley thought the soils might be poisoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content> You told him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I just thought –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Russ said you were having an affair. Was that your cover? Every Thursday night you'd –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>It's not what you think. Do you remember that telecom case I said that we didn't get last year? In fact, we did, and I was swamped. Every Friday morning we had a conference call with London, so the night before I would –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>That's your excuse? You expect me to believe that you were at the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>What's the biggest argument we've ever had? You said I spend too much time away from home. That I don't need a job, that you would take care of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Yeah, that's all true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>You yelled at me. You made me feel like you didn't value anything that I did. I need this job to feel like I'm accomplishing something on my own. That's why I lied to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>If I call your office tomorrow and I check –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Call my office, call my secretary, call my clients – interrupt their dinner, wake them up, I don't care. I just want you to know the truth. You know I love you. Come here. Please.  It's okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Fire her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What for? You seemed to have lied your way out of any trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Until Bill checks up on my cover. And I have to create a whole new one to cover that one up. I've done it before but it's a pain. And I would like Dr. Hadley to share that pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She didn't reveal any confidences, and she had a valid medical reason to ask about your landscaping class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>We can see what a jury says about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And admit to your husband the truth? You're not gonna sue us. We will remove Dr. Hadley from all patient contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But it's for Dr. Hadley's benefit, not yours. We have no obligation to inflict you on her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Fine.  But just so you know, this is not for your benefit. Dr. Cuddy's furious that you put her hospital at risk. She just knows it's a bad idea to admit it in front of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Think what you want. By the way, your orderly's outside. But I'd wait about another ten minutes if you really want your husband to think you're having radiation treatments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Dr. Hadley, are you by chance gonna cry? 'Cause that's one I just can't do.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You called the medical board?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>What is she talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Accusations of sexual harassment. You don't think I know it's you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Thirteen, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You already got me fired from the case. What else do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Dr. Hadley. Get out here now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're acting like an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> She's trying to make me lose my license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And she'll fail, unless you're stupid enough to go in there and scream at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sexual harassment accusations are incredibly serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If she made them anonymously, the case goes away. If she used her name, we all back you up, it goes away. You're completely overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You'd be pissed off too if you were me. Or maybe not, I don't know. You're just about as emotional as she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm doing you a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I know. And even when you try to do something nice, you sound like a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For firing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Don't do that, that's not what this is about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Then I'll apologize anyway. I did it for me. Not for you. I realized that right after I fired you. But I couldn't admit it. Screwed everything up. I hope that we can still work together. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Something's wrong with her liver. Blood flow is backing up, spilling into her esophagus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>From the cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This isn't lymphoma. We don't know what it is. We can wrap bands around the veins, but the bleed is so bad, that might not work. I want to try something called a "TIPS," a shunt that makes the blood bypass the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>That – that'll save her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It should help preserve her liver and heart. The liver cleans out toxins, bypass it too long, she'll get brain damage, eventually die. That's still probably less dangerous than bleeding out now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Probably? Valerie, she usually makes the decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You gotta step up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Was she cheating on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I can't discuss –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Just tell me she wasn't lying. Just tell me that. I'm supposed to make this decision? I don't even know who she is anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Either way, you gotta do it right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. You be the clock. Everyone else will be the doctors. Heart, kidneys, now liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Amyloidosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No speckles on the MRI. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Too much kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Primary hepatic fibrosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's our best guess. Start her on steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Even if we're right, the liver's probably too scarred. We've got to list her for a new one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>With an unconfirmed diagnosis? Not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How about a family member?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't think the husband is the right blood type. Even if he was, he's not gonna give his liver now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He left her, I assume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not yet. Says he won't abandon her while she's sick. She have any other family members?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No one's gonna risk their life to save hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Man, one false accusation from a psychopath, and you turned out to be a real bummer. I'm gonna go see if Wilson has any liver left.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wait a minute, is that actually a check for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. It's a giant novelty item for winning the lottery. You're just standing really far away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of all the people to go the extra mile for, why this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don't know. He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why not Cuddy? You never apologized after you defaced her photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorhouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, it's because Cuddy actually means something to you, which makes it much harder to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oy. If it will make you shut up, I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Forget the photo. House, she was in love with you.  And all she got in return was abuse. For years you toyed with her emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wasn't in love with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The fact that you still can't admit it just proves my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What do you want? Helping the guy was your idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, help the guy, whatever... I'm just pointing out that it's much easier to soothe your guilt by throwing money at a stranger than by making amends to a person you actually care about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You had me at "much easier." I'm gonna pretend to go to work now.  Bing! </content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sarah? I'm Dr. Hadley. I'm–I'm sorry to bother you, but I was told you're Valerie's sister? I was just surprised you came to visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Yeah, so is the rest of my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I was even more surprised you got tested as a donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Wrong blood type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But why? I mean, you know what she's like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>She's not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes, she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Our dad was a mean drunk. I was the older sister. I was supposed to stand up for her, not the other way around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She protected you when you were kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Yeah, and then all of a sudden... All of his crap and all of his abuse... It just changed her. It made her cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom. I spoke to her sister. She wasn't always like this. She changed, and right around adolescence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So liver, heart, brain, can lie dormant, and, it starts at puberty.  The raw food diet made it go fulminant... Nuts are high in copper. It's Wilson's Disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We ruled that out. No keyser-fleischer rings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There is one other sign. I know there are lipstick lesbians. Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>She's not supposed to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As a doctor. You didn't say anything about her capacity as a beautician's assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Her fingernail's blue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep.  start her on chelation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>What just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're gonna get better. Your body has an inability to process copper. It caused all of your problems. Even what's wrong with your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>And that's gonna change too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's probably rewired her neurons permanently by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>But it's possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe. I have to go get the chelation equipment. Bill, I need you to sign some forms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't see what she's doing? She's laying the groundwork to get her treatment, wake up a completely different person, so that you and all of your money stay with her. It's a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>You said there was a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Okay, there's a teeny chance. But even if it cures her, it's not going to make her love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>I was happy before...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I know. And I'm sorry, but it wasn't real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>It felt real. I don't know... Maybe that can be enough.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content> I got an "A+” with your paper. I was an orthopedic surgeon for ten years at New York Mercy. I had a gambling problem. I tried to cover it by over-billing some medicare patients. Lost my license. That's why I'm here. Not because of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you telling me this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content> Because I thought you'd be the same bastard you were in med school, but, uh... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Keep it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>No, I can get another place.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Wibberly</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>When you're better, we're gonna take a long vacation. You wanna go to Vietnam, one of the beaches, we're gonna get a hut. Just you and me, nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Wha–what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I mean, when you had a suspicion, fine. But you know now. How can you be this pitiful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>You don't mean this. You're sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>I'm not sick. I almost died and I still might. And who knows, maybe it's focusing my mind because the idea of spending the rest of my life with you –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>Because he's pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He hasn't changed... But you have. The treatment actually worked on your brain. If you were still a psychopath, you would've just kept draining him dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Valerie</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're feeling something. What is it? What do you feel?</content></utterance>
