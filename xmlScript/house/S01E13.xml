<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Baffling. Though I vaguely recall a disease called noomonia, numania?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But his X-ray and CT scan show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pneumonia! That’s it. Just a guess here, but are his parents big donors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No infiltrate! Just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tiny unicorns goring his bronchial tubes would be cooler. And the way you’re ignoring my question… wow, they’re extremely big donors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He’s not responding to cefuroxime, his pulsox is dropping much faster than it should for pneumonia, and plus, he’s got an odd little rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excessive irritation. He’s 12, he’s on auto-stroke –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>On his arm. Papular lesion, one centimeter, on top of a long thin scab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah, you need a dermatologist. If it’s dry, keep it wet, if it’s wet, keep it dry, if it’s not supposed to be there, cut it off. I never could master all of that.  There you are. Were you scared? It’s okay. You’re home now. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The rash is a total snooze.  Unless it’s connected to the pneumonia, then it’s party time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Legionnaire’s disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Usually means industrial ventilation systems, convention centers. He’s twelve years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Send off a urine antigen and check if he’s joined the Elks. Next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Fungal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excellent. Maybe the lodge went spelunking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chlamydia and pneumonia.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Rickettsial. Tick bites. Nymphal ticks are out now, they’re bloodthirsty little bastards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Rash would be more pustular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not always. And there’s only one rash, which fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>New Jersey, it’s most likely Lyme disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All right. Let’s keep him on fluids and cefuroxime to be safe. And biopsy that rash. And take another history. Even if we don’t learn what’s causing this we definitely need to know if twelve-year-olds are getting any action. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>They know what they’re doing, Jeffrey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>Oh, great endorsement coming from the woman who thought it was a nasty cold. If I’d had him last week and –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re checking to see if your son has a tick bite.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>I’m not that good at sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No hanging out anywhere new, strange places?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>We’ve been through this. We don’t let him run wild through the neighborhood.  Right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay, this might be a bit delicate. We need to know if you’re sexually active.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>Where’s the machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We passed it, actually. Little tension in the room back there. Thought you could use a break. Your dad’s a pretty high-powered guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>Yeah. He was an Air Force test pilot. Real top-gun stuff. Flew a Mach 3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hard to deal with, sometimes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>I guess I’m more like my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Listen, I promise to keep my mouth shut, but I need to know. You definitely haven’t had any sexual contact of any kind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>I wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Know what? Girls like the cool guys now. You give it a few years, they start liking the smart guys. You’ll be all right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I have to, it’s my job. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>I’m cursed. I’m not kidding. This seance thing the kids did? It spelled out my name, said I was gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>First name and last name? We’ve got a Gabe upstairs. He’s very old, very sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>No! It’s me. I have the worst luck. One time, I broke this mirror. The next week, my parents got separated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My parents got split up, too. Every kid thinks like it’s his fault, it never is. So what about the rest of the stuff? Any playing outside that your parents don’t know about, anything like that? Maybe you were somewhere you weren’t supposed to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>Oh, man.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We ran some tests, and the results point toward sarcoidosis. It makes the body’s tissue swell up. It seems to have gone after Gabriel’s skin and lungs, and given him this fever.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Is it treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Very, actually. See, this  is IV methotrexate. It’s an anti-inflammatory, which should make all the swelling go down, and get you all better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right, two incredibly rare diseases just happening to strike at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>Unless you’ve got a better theory.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, there’s no reason you both can’t be wrong. It’s not allergy, but it’s not coincidence, either. Disease number one set off disease number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Anthrax weakened his immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis. Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start him on methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>Pain in the wrist. Won’t go away for months.  Six doctors’ brilliant conclusion is to take it easy. I write a check, name goes on a plaque, and forty-eight hours later I’ve got two MRIs, a bone scan, and a diagnosis: carpal tunnel. I’m in surgery that afternoon.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably. I was hoping to do this by sheer manipulation, but if you insist on talking, fine, talk.  What did he do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your diagnosis is wrong. No auto-immune disease. The swelling’s probably just down because we’ve got him on steroids. It’s masking whatever’s wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Phospholipid antibodies are negative, so no lupus. Same for Churg-Strauss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, getting better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection. The anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hope you can get in. You’re not registered. I get it. You had to make up a lie. Can’t just tell your kid you’re here to see him. What father does that? That little blue dot under your collar.  It’s a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment. I was looking for it after I saw what you had for breakfast: brown rice and vegetables, macrobiotic diet. Popular with Hollywood starlets and cancer patients.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>Three months.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>I’d prefer you not tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s better. I’ll get to see his face when he reads his dad’s obituary.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh! This is where I give you advice and pretend you’re going to listen to it. I like this part. Did Rowan ask you not to tell?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Telling him, now that’s got real entertainment value.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmmm, he might even cry. On the other hand, there is the “do unto others” thingy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then I should definitely tell him! I’d want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want to know everything. There’s also the “keeping your promises” thingy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The little ones call me Uncle Gregg. Your dad never had carpal tunnel. You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How’d you know about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>I read about them on the internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what’d you search for? “Diseases from Asia that don’t match my son’s symptoms”? You heard about them in Asia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>I’ve never been there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you probably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory. Some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year… starting to come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>I’m calling Dr. Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your dad’s pissed off. He should be. Comes here, expecting us to do an extra good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content> Don’t talk to my son like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just telling him my job, my obligation to this –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Stop! What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s only one thing that you guys have got to do. Tell the truth, or your son will die. How long were you in Asia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Jeff, it’s a simple question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-21"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>Two years, in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-22"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Why would you lie about something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-23"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>It was ’87 and ’88. This, uh, this guru, I thought he had some answers. I went to his ashram, and, um, ended up with no money and no answers. I was embarrassed, I didn’t want anybody to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-24"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>No. No, you were a test pilot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-25"><speaker>Jeffrey</speaker><content>I’m so sorry, Gabe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-26"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What does this have to do with my son? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clue number one: If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Demonic possession?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Close, but no wafer. Clue number two: Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes auto-immune symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Leprosy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s real big in the Jersey suburbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s leprosy. Run a FITE stain, it’ll be positive. Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But it’s obviously dormant in the dad, how could the kid catch it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not dormant in the dad, it’s just slow. Damaged his ulnar nerve, was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel. Never trust doctors. Run a FITE stain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>No wonder he got anthrax. The leprosy weakened his immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vicious circle. The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax, and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But the antibiotics we gave him, they cure leprosy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s where the trouble starts.  The antibiotics hit the nerve strands, they kill the leprosy bacteria. The corpses get tossed into the system. And as fascinating as our bodies are, they’re also stupid. They produce antibodies to beat dead bacteria. And these aren’t the polite antibodies, they’re the ones that won’t sit still; kick during naptimes. They attack his neural and fat cells, cause some inflammation and all the rest of his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>So the cure’s killing him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48. Get them to send up some thalidomide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thalidomide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Twelve-year-olds don’t have sex, right? So he can’t be pregnant. Make the call.  I need to speak to your boy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why does everybody need to know my business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People like talking about people. Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’d tell you my dad left, my mum drank herself to death… you gonna care about me more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cameron would. Me, I just like knowing stuff.  I know you hate your dad, but I’m gonna tell you something –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don’t hate him. I loved him until I figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. You don’t expect him to turn up to your football match? No disappointments. You don’t expect a call on your birthday, don’t expect to see him for months? No disappointments. You want us to go make up? Sink a few beers together, nice family hug? I’ve given him enough hugs. He’s given me enough disappointments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s it. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Breathe.  Breathe again. Breathe again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>You gonna have to tell my friends I’m a leper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You had the antibiotics. You’re not contagious any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>What if they already caught it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch. Even your mum didn’t get it. All right, I want you to make a fist. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>It’s still kinda stiff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’ll get back to normal in a month or two. Your skin, two or three weeks. You haven’t asked about your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content>He lied about everything. He lied to my mom. He lied to his boss. He’s just a liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>Gabe</speaker><content> I don’t love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, you do.  Nothing you can do about it. He’s your dad. It doesn’t matter what he does, you’re gonna love him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hey!  When’s your flight? You got time for a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>Wish I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Cabbie</speaker><content>Dr. Chase! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ve got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>You’re going to be getting down to Aus any time soon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not too long. Next autumn, I hope. I’ll call you. Well, you’re all set.  I’ll see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>Rowan</speaker><content>Yeah. I’ll see you. </content></utterance>
