<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not doing any more chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good plan. You'll be dead in five months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We went for a cure. It didn't work. I've thought about this a lot. Five more months on this earth is reasonable. A year in the hospital in excruciating pain is… not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With two weeks on, two weeks off of chemo, you'll have way more than a year, maybe two or three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House… I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not gonna let you just die.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Hey. You know, management research shows that the best ideas come from casual contact.  So…  one set of season tickets. Got the seat next to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> First game is October 8th. That's about one month after Wilson's expiration date. This isn't an unstructured collaboration. You're trying to be the new Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm trying to show you there are other people who care about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. I'm probably not gonna fall apart. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cheerleader on the video</speaker><content>Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Here we go. Cradle! One, two, three, four—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Put down the pom-poms. Step away from the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>46-year-old oncologist refuses treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Foreman already gave us a case. Wants us to keep things as normal as possible, for as long as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson is dying. Chase is gone. How close to normal do you think we can come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>19-year-old cheerleader admitted with massive nosebleed and dizziness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Cool. I just completely forgot that my best friend is dying. Wait. That just reminded me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Head CT is clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How can we turn Wilson from a terminal idiot into an interminable pain in the ass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mini-stroke could explain our patient's neurosymptoms and his butterfingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>But not his bloody nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My best friend is trying to kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He just wants to die with a little dignity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's no such thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>It's not your choice, House. Your only choice here is between acceptance and misery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a midline granuloma. Get your patient a PET scan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No lesions along the optic track?  You already covered that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Maybe we should get someone else to take this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why? Because someone somewhere is dying?  Oh, crap, turn off the mic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It is off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not according to his brain.  His temporal lobe is completely lit up. Auditory portion. He's hearing something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman's trying to date me. I assume that's because you called him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I — did you…  put something in my coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know how you can be there for me five months from now? Don't be dead five months from now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hey, Wils—  seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just a little picker-downer. I assume this unwanted interruption means you're looking for me to discuss the latest development in the case I don't want to discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Our patient is hearing voices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He denies it, but the PET scan says otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>He's at the right age for the onset of schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. You really need me. Ultrasound his abdomen to check for schizophrenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We already ordered a psych evaluation, but drugs could also cause—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ultrasound his dorm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Roommate</speaker><content> Whoa, just… You guys can't just come busting in here without a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're not cops. We're your roommate's doctors. Any idea what flavor of drugs would be making your roommate sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Roommate</speaker><content>Objection. Entrapment. I'm pre-law. Derrick doesn't party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Look at this. Why would he have a picture of a little boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe it's his nephew or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Hidden in his sock drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Roommate</speaker><content>Whoa! Creepy. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We need to talk to Derrick about some medical matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Well, she's my girlfriend. She can be here for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We found this…  in your dorm room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content> Who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Nobody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Then why was it hidden in a drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content>Derrick, what's she talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>It's my brother Christopher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content>You never told me you had a brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Well, he's been dead almost ten years, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Is that the voice you hear in your head?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Mm… Uhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And lo, he is risen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> So now my hair's gonna fall out next week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. All I did was temporarily kill you. How was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What — I don't — I wasn't dead, I was unconscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No dreams, no thoughts. You experienced nothing. Now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part. Just nothing times infinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn't just prove death is nothing. You proved Propofol is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're saying the end is not the end? I was expecting "nothing is better than something lousy," but not "the angels are waiting for me."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not having this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? 'Cause it doesn't make sense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because I'm not gonna change your mind, and I don't care. More importantly, you're not gonna change mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There is no heaven. There is no hell. Your soul is not gonna float out of your body and join some great unifying energy force. The fact that you're dying is not gonna change that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Please… just go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House. I have spent the last 20 years holding the hands of people as they die. When I watch that transformation… I'm sorry, I… don't believe that we're just a bag of chemicals. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>So are we gonna talk about the patient or wait for House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Viral encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>It's been going on for ten years. I'm gonna go in there and invite him to participate. I think he'd welcome the distraction.  Come with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why? When was the last time House listened to anything we said about anything personal? Maybe you'll feel better, but sometimes the truth is there's nothing anyone can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Temporal lobe epilepsy. Causes voices, dizziness. Trauma from seizure would explain the nosebleed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content>You know about all of my siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles and—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>You're overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content>Because you don't trust me enough to tell me—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Sorry. It's time to go down for your test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>If you wanna wait here, it'll only take about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>No. She's leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Courtney</speaker><content>Derrick, come on. I mean, we should at least talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>No, I'd rather you just leave. And you don't need to come back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Time. Any odd tastes or smells?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Nope. Feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Things look fine on my end too.  So… you won't admit to your doctors that you're hearing your brother's voice, which is dangerous. And now you lost your girlfriend over it, which is stupid. I assume there's more to the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>That's how I was raised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Short story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>The boss is losing his best friend to cancer. And instead of talking about the pain, he's pretending there is no pain because everything can be fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>My father tried to deal with it. Ironic that he'd drink himself into oblivion after my brother was killed by a drunk driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Do you need a tissue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content> After dad left, my mom moved us away. She got rid of all the pictures of Christopher and never mentioned him again. It was like he never existed. And that worked for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And yet, you kept one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Uh, my right eye… I was seeing spots, but now I can't see at all. Is that from the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> No. This is something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Aah! That hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How many fingers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Two. Fuzzy ones, but two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>There's a clot in the artery behind your eye. I just broke it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Is that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Don't know, because I don't know why it happened.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey. Saved us a table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There are no tables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I recently hacked into your old files. Found a six-year-old boy with bilateral retinoblastoma. Doctors wanted to take his eyes out before the cancer spread to his brain, and you fought them. Advocated for a new photon beam radiation. Saved the kid's vision. Probably saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That was my first case at PPTH. Mikey Kimble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content> It's Michael now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. This is our table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I…  How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content>I'm doing great. I'm graduating next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Already? Little Mikey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content>And I got accepted to Princeton. And I'm planning on going to med school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He's going to be a doctor instead of being dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content>Dr. House told me all about your situation. That's why I came. There's just so much good that you can do, even in a small amount of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wonder…  Hey! Is there anybody else here who's alive today because of Dr. James Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Elderly Woman</speaker><content>Gastric adenocarcinoma. 15 years in remission. Six grandchildren that I never would have met. Thank you, Dr. Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Middle Aged Man</speaker><content>Squamous cell lung cancer. 12 years in remission. I was able to walk my daughter down the aisle last May. Thank you, Dr. Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did the math. 74 children are alive today because of you. 14 grandchildren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mikey Kimble started kindergarten before the age cutoff. He would have graduated high school last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Michael</speaker><content> I flunked a year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Was anybody in this room really a patient of mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing "O" somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Its actually more impressive that they're too busy to be here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A glowing letter of recommendation you just wrote for me on my laptop. I notice it's lacking your signature at the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't you think you're being a bit premature predicting House's demise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not demise. Just implosion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's going through a rough time, but so far, he's been handling it—</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your shoes are wet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Glad to see your emotional turmoil hasn't dulled your powers of observation. I know you're responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you don't. 'Cause I didn't do it. Whatever it is. But if I had shoved those season tickets down some toilets, I would have done it because you asked me to. You wanted to replace Wilson. I prank Wilson all the time. Enjoy. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I got you three, but I drank them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You didn't have to call me, but I appreciate I made the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It wasn't entirely unselfish. I didn't feel right approaching any of my terminal patients, but… what is it like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hmm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does it ever stop being surreal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It'll stop, in about… five or six months, give or take, in your case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You know what happened to me today? One of my patients suddenly started crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It can't be your first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The first one… who was crying for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's the human response. It's either overly saccharine, because giving sympathy makes them feel better, or they ignore you, because hiding from mortality makes them feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why can't they just say something that makes me feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Like what, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You'd be doing what, two weeks on, two weeks off? So maybe do your first round, see how it goes. Maybe not as horrible, as you fear. Then do the second round, enjoy your two weeks off, and revisit the decision. Rinse, repeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I just can't envision spending my remaining time in a chemo suite in Princeton. I want to… enjoy myself with family and friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Friends or friend?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, this is Greg House. Again. Third message, hopefully indicating how much I want you to call me back. I'd say that your son is dying to increase the urgency, but you probably already know that.  The fake people who care that Wilson stays alive didn't work, so I need the real people who care about him to tell him what an idiot he's being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just got paged to go to the bathroom. I don't know where the rest of you are going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Some of our patient's symptoms might be physiological, and some might be psychological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think being forced to bury painful memories is making symptoms worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Grief avoidance can lead to all sorts of anxiety disorders, which can manifest into physical illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Let's assume… that all his symptoms are real symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>we're going to avoid grief avoidance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Studies after September 11th showed that repression was actually better for coping than dwelling in misery. What about polycythemia vera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>RBCs are slightly elevated, but not that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hodgkin's lymphoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Would have showed up in the PET scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What if your guy got hurt at practice? And, like everything else, just didn't tell anyone. Could have set off DIC, would explain everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I thought you had to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't say I had to go in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Janitor</speaker><content>Need some more mops in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>What exactly are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Blood. If your spinal fluid is yellow instead of clear, it means you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  What does your brother say to you? Does he tell you you're gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Doesn't really work like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I think you hear your brother's voice for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Thought you guys said that I hear things because I'm sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Yes. But that doesn't explain why you don't hear a different voice. I think your mom didn't let you deal with the grief of losing your brother properly. There are people here who could help you with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>The opening pressure's way too high.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> The prodigal daughter returns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You taking me up on my offer to off you? Think I've still got some leftover propofol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Spoke to Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's angry because I want him to live longer. Who wouldn't be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Friends respect each other's decisions, even if they don't agree with them. It's called loyalty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>But you do want to. You may have rationalized it a hundred different ways, but the fact is, you fired me so that I'd be forced to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted to do. It was probably the most… selfless thing anyone has ever done for me. And you don't even like me that much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I surrender.  I have been a disloyal… disrespectful jerk. I should have listened to what you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm still not letting my parents return your call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I made a reservation for two at Carmine's. Tonight. 8:00. No more tricks. No more manipulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Said Machiavelli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just… two friends enjoying the time they have left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Please, don't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That depends on how much you have to drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That sounds nice.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>I came as soon as I got your message. Is he gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We're hoping it's just excess fluid on his brain from an extreme migraine, which isn't good, but it's treatable. He's scheduled to get an MRI as soon as these meds start taking effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We found that picture in his dorm room. I'm not sure what Derrick's told you, but… he's been hearing Christopher's voice for the last ten years. And it's possible that repressing all that grief he's felt is actually causing some of Derrick's symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>I don't even know if this voice in my head is something I invented or if it's what Christopher was really like. With no photos, no video… my memories… I really don't have any anymore. Maybe you could just… tell me a little bit about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content> I'm sorry. It was a long drive in. I'm gonna go get a coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> 79-years old, and you told her she was pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, it cured her hiccups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Now, I know that the tiramisu is great here, but I actually ordered off-menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Great.  I told you, you didn't hang the bear bag high enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It was a smart bear. I'm almost certain he untied my knots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, he wasn't that smart. He left the Oreos behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You hiked for 32 miles eating nothing but creamy filling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The black stuff is overrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> To climbing the hill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay. If I did decide to… stick around a little longer—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't do that to me Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I'm not, I'm just — I do feel pretty good and I… Maybe I should try it for a little while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I… I think that's reasonable. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Are you c-conning me? You're conning me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wha— just because you folded, that means it must be some evil plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, that's usually how it works with you. You drown me in nostalgia so I'll think about our friendship and feel some kind of loyalty and agree to more chemo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was real nostalgia. It was real emotion, a real decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>A decision that I just made for you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need you, okay? I want you to be around as long as possible. 'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No. No.  Don't do that. I don't owe you anything. Our entire relationship has been about you. My dying is about me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at you. You don't wanna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Of course, I don't wanna die!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I did! I tried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, get out of my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't have to just accept this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, I do have to accept this. I have five months to live, and you're making me go through this ALONE!  I'm pissed because I'm dying, and it's not fair. And I need… I need a friend. I need to know that you're there. I need—I need you to tell me that my life… was worthwhile, and I… I need you to tell me that you love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No. I'm not gonna tell you that unless you fight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Blood vessels are nonreactive. It's not a migraine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>I'm not feeling so great. How much longer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Finishing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content> Thank you, Dr. Adams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> It looks like the ceiling might….</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What are you doing back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We got a case. Assume the status is, patient's getting worse. You guys are confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You think actually showing up for work is enough to make up for ruining an MRI, endangering the patient, injuring us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got an airtight alibi, that I'm working on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This isn't about the damage. You're back because something's going on with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm done with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What does that mean, you're done with Wilson? If he's not dead, you're not done with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You suddenly think you're gonna make a difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can't just abandon him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's in his hands now. Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Enough to know it wasn't a migraine. And the patient mistook me for Adams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Come with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what do you think's gonna happen when I stick a needle into his eardrum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You quizzing us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, this is a good quiz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>He'll scream in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't listen to her. Very small needle, very steady hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content> Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boy, that air sure is red. Persistent stapedial artery. It should disappear in the embryonic stage, but just like his dead brother, he really can't let go. An artery's been pressing against the temporal lobe of his brain, right above the ear canal. It explains the voices, the dizziness, everything. Now you guys can explain how we're gonna make him better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content> Will my brother's voice go away?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're being an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I just cured a patient. How 'bout you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can't just give up on Wilson. You know he needs you. You know he's making an impossible choice. He just doesn’t want to live in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Life is pain! I wake up every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how many times I wanted to just give up? How many times I thought about ending it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You here to yell at me or give me hockey tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Had to delay the surgery because our patient drank ammonia from the janitor's cart. I guess… he didn't want to live without his brother's voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can't wait to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here, let me help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? You wanna live!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content>He did something stupid. He's not gonna do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're resisting me because it's our human responsibility to stay alive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> You made your point, House! Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> You've spent your whole life looking for the truth. But sometimes the truth just sucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm, uh… I'm gonna be leaving, uh, quite a bit earlier then we had talked about. The… next day or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What happened? Something between you and House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> He's not my child. I cannot be responsible for the happiness of Gregory House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, uh… I'll get these to Frankel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You are responsible. The past 20 years you've had three wives, hundreds of colleagues, thousands of patients. But you've kept that one best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He wants me to suffer a misery, that I don't want to go through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chemo won’t make your life any better, but caring will. Enduring pain to do some good for someone you care about… Isn’t that what life is?</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content> Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>That picture of Christopher that I had on the stand. Did you take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>Did you throw it out?  If I agree to get the surgery, can you bring that picture back? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I'm ready to start the next round of chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because you need me and… I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You're the only one I listen to. The last couple of days, I didn't, and I almost killed my patient. So I think it's time for me to accept that… you're just smarter than I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Are you really okay that there's only five months left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But it's better than nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Um… How do we start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not gonna say "I love you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Thank God. You got any Oreos?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>The surgery worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Jen</speaker><content>How can you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Derrick</speaker><content>'Cause Christopher's gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> And this is the peak. Almost 8,000 feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little since the last time we went hiking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just add another day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is Matt Johnson, the hospital lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. I have decided not to proceed with the sexual harassment case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Matt</speaker><content> Are these yours? The plumber retrieved them from the hospital outflow pipe. They caused a sewage backup that ruined the MRI, and they have your name on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gregory Danger House. It's… a very common name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Matt</speaker><content>These apparently have your fingerprints on them also.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why don't you tell me how many hours of picking up trash you want me to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House… I tried to keep this internal. The fire department handed the tickets to the police who contacted your parole officer. It's felony vandalism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Matt</speaker><content>You have to report to Mercer County Jail on Monday to serve out the rest of your sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And that's… that's how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> How long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Six months.</content></utterance>
