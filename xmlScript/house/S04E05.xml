<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, uh, just in case I need them, where exactly will Dr. Foreman be keeping my balls?  If you want to keep your jobs, that never happened. The only way to get the cat burglar is to catch him in the act. Give the patient a methacholine challenge, see if it sets off laryngospasm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content> No. What exactly does it...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Uh, what about a spinal cord lesion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Have to be in the brain stem and it still doesn't explain the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Weird, though... That he's the boss. Didn't he quit recently? Was it a money issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Lungs, stomach, numbness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No that wasn't it, it was something else... Was it bling account? Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We have to unify these symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh! I remember. You don't want to turn into me. Right? You didn't want to become evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Can we stick to the medicine here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Absolutely. I'm just flattered. In a few short weeks, seems like I've just turned towards the light. I mean... either that or you've sold your soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Multiple marantic emboli could...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Get a raise? 'Cause then you're a whore. Or didn't you? 'Cause then you're a stupid whore.  Patient just crashed.  Can they go, boss? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>But?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No but. You're right about all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It seems I didn't get out of here soon enough. The world thinks I've been corrupted, so no one will hire me. I hate being here. I'd love to quit... but I can't. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Okay, while you're killing him... I'll get the intubation kit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position. There's no point in me humiliating you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So I'm going to humiliate Cuddy, until she fires you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Guy's faking. It's Munchausen’s. You notice the EMT run sheet?  Paramedic who brought him in is also named Martin Harris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well.  If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel, I'd say you might be on to something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Look.  Room 406, abdominal pain. Room 403, left-sided numbness. 402, syncope. He's copying his neighbours' symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, coincidence is much more likely than you being a stubborn jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Munchausen's patients create symptoms, not names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Munchausen's patients have medical histories they don't want us reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>No laryngeal spasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>13</speaker><content>Breathing's resumed normal rate. Without intubation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>See? Nothing's wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's in a lab coat. Munchausen's pretend to be patients, not doctors. He's got mirror syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Giovannini's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Do you know another mirror syndrome? Brain's got no idea who he is, where he is or what he is. But it fills the holes with whatever dirt's lying around. He reads a name tag, he's got a name. Sees a doctor, he's got a job. Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>My explanation's simpler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well if it's simple, then we discharge the nut bar. But if it's complicated, then the nut bar has got brain damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>So we let him jerk them around for a few days until we're sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Sure, what could possibly go wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What's going on here, Martin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>PATIENT</speaker><content>Operation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>House, who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Excellent question. Who are you, Martin?  He just likes to watch, do stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Number ten scalpel for initial incision. Glad you're here, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Of course you are.  It's lecture time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Yeah, it is. Stop worrying about the power play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Was that it? I think you can go a lot deeper here. I mean, WHY am I so obsessed by all of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You're threatened by Foreman and feel the need to impress Cuddy. The only thing that's relevant is Foreman is a good doctor. He can help you, lighten the load.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good idea. I'll have him sort my mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>PATIENT</speaker><content>Sure! Deflect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Who is this guy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I think we just found out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>PATIENT</speaker><content>It's all about Cuddy. Got to be the alpha dog.  Can almost smell the pheromones now, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>PATIENT</speaker><content>Hah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Told you I didn't need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>House! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>PATIENT</speaker><content>Owww! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die.  Can't fake that!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Mirror syndrome patients have no agenda, no axe to grind. They can read you because they have to. Moods, attitudes, everything. They're like mind readers. Except they can read your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Unfortunately, we have to cure him. His hand wasn't black when he came in, the operating room was sterile, the only thing different was the temperature. Cold agglutinins means...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>It's got to be some kind of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No fever, so it's got to be a tiny infection, hard to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You'd better find it fast. This guy feels another cool breeze, his blood turns to slop and he drops.  I need three ways to pinpoint infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Blood cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Blood's clumpy. Nothing you can do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Unless we soak him in warm water before we draw it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good, what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Ultrasound his abdomen, look for an abscess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I have a regrettable announcement. Kitchen has just learned that our annual shipment of mayonnaise was improperly stored, so anybody who ate... well, the food, should head across the lobby to the clinic right away. Ask for Dr. Cuddy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're not punishing Cuddy, you're punishing every doctor in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's her building, her doctors. Still need one more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Well, we need to find out his history. Where he's been, what he's done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>Yeah he has no memory, but his bio's tattooed to his rear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> The mayo is fine. You can stay where you are. I'm a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Mail order. I've seen the diplomas. Two N's in university.  Big Love was right. History's the key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>BRENNAN</speaker><content>No ID, no wallet. No missing persons report filed for a hundred miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The key is the key. He had car keys in his pocket when he was admitted.  Keep him in the isolation room, so he doesn't pick up extreme bitch syndrome from one of the nurses.  Run the ultrasound  and the blood cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>The cultures were my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No one's keeping score... You're losing.  Search the street where he was mugged, find the car and the registration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>There could be thousands of cars. Why do I get this assignment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because if you deal with the patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I'll go with Cole.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> No need for the heart biopsy. I now know exactly who he is and what he has. You saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, you idiot. It's vapour rub and lunch receipts.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's 8:00 at night. The biopsy will be faster. Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point.  Thirteen.   Is your name Thirteen?  Why did you volunteer to go street walking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>13</speaker><content>I thought I could help that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there. Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here. Didn't want to look in the mirror?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>You think he'll mimic her if I'm in there with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're a powerful, dominating man, but who knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>So I'm going to get fired before her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know. But how is he? Bitter? Sexually frustrated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>13</speaker><content>He's delightful. Loves the smell of freshly baked rhubarb pie and isn't afraid to love. Also, his rash is coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-30"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>He needs the meds and the tub. Just to keep him stable.</content></utterance>
