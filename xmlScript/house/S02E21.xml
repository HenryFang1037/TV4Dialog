<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said you would --</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I wish I could</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just want a little tiny slice of this guy’s brain, that’s all I need, just enough to tell me what’s killing Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A thin slice of Joe’s brain could also cause a public health crisis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not a good idea to scream “fire” every time someone lights a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don’t downplay this, House. You put both of them in isolation for a reason. Joe’s death elevates the situation to a biosafety level 3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oooh. Level 3. We should call Jack Bauer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I called the CDC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, tell them we’ll be really, really careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We don’t have the proper equipment for you to be really, really careful! You can do whatever you want to Foreman but the CDC will do this autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever. The point is, we’ll be lucky to get results in three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I told them how urgent this is –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’ll have the results in… three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah, that’s a shame, because Foreman will never get a chance to know what it was, because he’ll be dead in 36 hours. Maybe this is a toxin; maybe it’s not contagious at all. You’re killing Foreman because of a “maybe.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re doing it. Now. Ever study how they used to do ice-pick lobotomies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Read about it in med school. Why would I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shove an ice-pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct. Bang it a couple of times with the hammer, get a sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s going on, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Foreman, you can’t do it! You’d be in violation of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t do the time if you’re not alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You – I need you to suit up. Get that equipment away from Dr. Foreman. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take your time, guys! Just tell them to go slow; it won’t be your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Foreman, we don’t even know what kind of contagion we’re dealing with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is why we need to chop into the guy’s head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s dangerous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to you, Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There are other ways to diagnose you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah? You have the answer?  Foreman, do it now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I am warning you, do not – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That didn’t feel right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He’s blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He thinks he can see, same as the cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need something to bag the sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, no, I’m fine! House, there’s the sample, test it! You’ve gotta test that sample!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours. Intractable, unbearable pain is up next. Sure you don’t want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His CSF might show signs of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>LP’s pointless. We already did a brain biopsy, it was negative. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Toxic mold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If it was toxic mold, I’d be sick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do I seem happy to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Never. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let’s assume it’s not blood-borne. If you start cracking jokes we can reassess. In the meantime, stay away from people and animals that you care about. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Guillain-Barre.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Start treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>For arbovirus? You think our Jersey-beat cop has spent a lot of time exploring deep, dark Africa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treatment for everything – likely or unlikely. If you can think of it, treat for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mixing that many meds will create all sorts of toxic interactions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’ll box his liver, trash his kidneys… there’s got to be a better way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course there’s a better way! It’s that body sitting in the room with him that Cuddy won’t let us touch! Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals, parasites – it’s got to be one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House wants to start you on some meds. They’re in the airlock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Leading candidate is toxic mold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Is Cameron sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m fine. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You’re casting the net a little wider than toxic mold, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Guillain-Barre’s also on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s an oval shape, that’s either an L or a 7, I’m guessing an L – levofloxacin, can’t rule out bacteria. 800 -- that’s the dosage for acyclovir in case it’s viral. Square, no, more like a rhombus – that’s fluconazole for fungus… there’s about eight others here; you’re treating me for everything! You’ve got no idea what I’ve got!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House thinks this is the best course of action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House is desperate. House is never desperate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Something we give you will work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, we should start treating all patients this way. When they get sick they just take everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s better than doing nothing. </content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’m at the cop’s place. You have to retrace your steps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don’t think the “treat him for everything” approach is enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where did you start your search?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re going to tell me everything you did, everything you touched. If you went to the john I want to know when and why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I started with samples from the mold in his sink. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s it. Then I left. What do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is that your kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, obviously I couldn’t bring him here. He’s been exposed to whatever Foreman’s got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You infected Steve?! Why didn’t you just get a rat from the pet store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I needed one with a clean medical history. Who knows what kind of antibiotics they gave those rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So this is your plan, just sit here and watch your rat all day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eh, it shouldn’t take long. Got the AC blasting, I soaked the floor of his cage….  As soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>As soon as he’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right after he gets sick, there’s a good chance he’ll get hit in the head with a cane-shaped object.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Normally you just use your patients as lab rats. It’s a nice change. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First symptom is euphoria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you know if a rat’s euphoric?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Big word. Someone’s been on the interweb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>I looked up a few articles on epilepsy. You know, there’s actually some really great youth soccer leagues that would cater specifically to her special needs, and I think it might explain why she’s been having a hard time in pre-school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let’s confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back. Strobing lights and high pitched sounds can provoke a seizure.  Woooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>You’re a goof!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Takes one to know one, loser! Wait, that means I’m a loser. Scratch that. These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She seem upset by them or just tired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>No, she kind of thinks it’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy. In actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying “yoo hoo” to the hoo-hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>She’s what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Marching the penguin. Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood. Finding Nemo. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>That was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s called gratification disorder. Sort of a misnomer – if one was unable to gratify oneself…that would be a disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content> Are you saying she’s masturbating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was trying to be discreet – there’s a child in the room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Mother</speaker><content>This is horrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Epilepsy is horrifying. Teach your girl about privacy and she’ll be fine.  Here you go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They promised to expedite –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tough to do an autopsy when they haven’t even picked up the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s tough to treat your patient when you’re not even on the same floor. Go, clinic is covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I go watch the meds drip into his IV, you think that’ll make the treatment work faster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Go to your office, play with your ball, write on your whiteboard, insult your team, do whatever it is you do to figure things out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’ll start weaning him off, one at a time. Which one do we start with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t care if you do it alphabetically. Just stay on top of his vision – first sign of regression means we’ve taken him off the wrong one. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your choice is currently between four hours from now and fourteen hours from now, so I’m assuming that means you want the latter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The cocktail’s working. My vision’s almost completely restored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The meds are curing what’s in your head but they’re trashing your pancreas. That’s why you’re puking and you can’t stand up without screaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So lower the dosages. Less stress on my pancreas, still battle the infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lower dosages would still be toxic –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t care! I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think you can handle a life without a pancreas? We keep you on these meds, you’ll spend the last four hours of your life being able to see. Take you off, you’ll go blind again, but it’ll give us time to figure out what’s eating your brain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It is. It just means that the infection has moved to the primary motor cortex, which controls the muscles. Aren’t you glad you sent me to med school?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection. Our cop wasn’t, he had Legionnaire’s Disease. Our cop didn’t turn into brain food until we cured the legionella. Legionella slowed down the disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why would that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No idea. Just know that it did.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not great. It didn’t fix anything, it just slowed it down. The whole point was to give Steve a little more time to get sick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why are you asking me that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I’m sure you spent the first twelve years of your life dreaming of being a vet. The rat is not getting sick. Cameron is not getting sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s okay. It’s not your fault. Presumably you’re still healthy because whatever it is is not blood borne. Steve has no excuse; he did everything that Foreman did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Some bacterial infections don’t affect rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman tested negative for every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And what infections could he be positive for but test negative for? When we test for infections, we look for antibodies.  Now, what if the patient is infected, but has no antibodies – what if the body is not fighting the infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why would –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neh, eh, I asked first. Let’s start with the ‘what’, we’ll deal with the ‘why’ later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If the body doesn’t recognize the infection our tests come back negative and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman. And what if the patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella? The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire. So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects humans and not rats, and the human body would be unlikely to recognize.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The answer is listeria. I’m starting you on amp and gent. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you’re basing this theory on the tests being negative and your rat being healthy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the fact that Legionnaire’s is helping you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But the medicine you wanna give me will put an end to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And if it’s not listeria all the gent will do is cure the Legionnaire’s Disease and put whatever is killing me back into overdrive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I’m wrong. The antibiotics are in the airlock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think the first biopsy didn’t give us the answer because you didn’t go deep enough. I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely. Don’t blame you. The world is such a complicated place if you’ve got higher reasoning skills. I’m often jealous of smaller animals and retarded children. Take the antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There can be minimal damage if it’s done right. If the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One slip, you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’d rather be disabled than dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure, I make it look oh-so-sexy. It’s actually not as glamorous as you may think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The biopsy will tell us for sure what’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The antibiotics could do the same thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could! Not will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We try it, we see!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The antibiotics will bring back the pain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pain makes us make bad decisions. Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator. Now look, we still have time. I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before. </content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was rude and unnecessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What does “out of time” mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His O2 stats are at 94 right now. As long as they’re above 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn’t increase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So what? There’s no point in waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were right. We should be cutting into a corpse’s head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah! We should be, except the CDC has got the cop’s body under –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s got to be other bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You think this thing has killed other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that apartment was a dump. Just because Steve McQueen didn’t get sick doesn’t mean some other varmint didn’t. You give me an hour, I go back there and find a dead animal, we cut its head open instead of Foreman’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman’s already at 100% oxygen. Once his O2 stats hit 90, I can’t wait any longer. Where’s your suit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either you’ll find the answer, or I’ll find the answer. Doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Great. How fast can you get it in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll know in about 30 seconds. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You better have the bird, the surgical team’s in place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How can you not capture a blind bird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant. I screwed up the first time through this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Foreman told you everywhere he went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not where, it’s when. He came here in the early afternoon. Me and Steve came two hours too late, you came six hours too early. It’s the water, the irrigation system only pumps –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House, I tested the water, the water’s clean!  House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We tested the wrong water. He stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water.  It’s riddled with Naegleria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You already did the biopsy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He has primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. It’s a parasite that goes through the nose and migrates into the brain, where it feeds on brain cells. The legionella attacked the parasite, that’s why the disease slowed down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Rodney</speaker><content>Is it treatable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We started him on an antiparasitic and the amoebas will clear out of his system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Rodney</speaker><content>And then he’ll be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And then we’ll wean him out of the coma –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Rodney</speaker><content>Will he be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’ll be no lasting damage from the parasite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Rodney</speaker><content>But the surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We don’t know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron, my dad, and the manipulative bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You remembered.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>Rodney</speaker><content>Great, relieved… great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What did I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba, CDC autopsy eventually found the amoeba, and House found it in the water in the cop’s roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wiggle your left toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wait, you went back and she did the biopsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your left toes, Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you didn’t.</content></utterance>
