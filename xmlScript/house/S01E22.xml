<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No, no, he’ll be here. I’m sure he’s just running a little late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s cancelled two exams, he’s not gonna –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He’s scared of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. The ex-boy-toy. Eh, that makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He wasn’t scared before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, you think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Sudden mood swings, infantile regression, abdominal pain, he’s passed out twice, yeah! I think it might be a medical problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s twenty minutes late. I’m outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Please.  He’ll be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why? Because he loves you and does everything he’s told?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Because I didn’t tell him you’d be here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He likes to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yes, he does. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Stace? What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Hey – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Gregg House. You must be Matt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Mark. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Mark Warner.  Don’t get up.  Sorry, pair of conferences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Hi. Wow. Gregg House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>No, I haven’t been avoiding you, I just didn’t want to waste your time. The other doctors checked me out and they said it was just stress. College season, kids, parents, they’re all over me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Makes sense to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Gregg –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You said you’d check him out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He says he’s healthy. What’s to check out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Sorry for the mix-up, but I’m glad you two got a chance to catch up. Looks like you’re having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, he’s good. If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything. I can’t tell you how much I like your fella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Yeah, me too. You know, I thought you’d be all sarcastic, bitter, you know, because Stacy married me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, we should do things together. Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>We could go for a run together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hah! He’s Oscar Wilde!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Wow, this pissing contest is really turning me on. He needs to go to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Here’s to women. You can’t live with ‘em, you can’t kill ‘em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content> Damn straight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m definitely taller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I have more hair. And I think that… oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Mark? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content> Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton-Plainsboro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Garçon!   It’s okay, ladies and gentlemen, nothing to worry about. Unless you had the veal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You dosed him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told you, I’d check him out. I was a little worried they were gonna get here before he’d passed out. Would have been tougher to get him to drink. I’ll give you a ride. We can talk. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Tummyache, cranky, no apparent source. Any thoughts? Foreman, you gonna contribute, or you too tired from stealing cars?  I’m being House. It’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know. You made milk come out of my nose. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Morning. You guys got the file? What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Previous tests revealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we’re done! What do you think, ball game, zoo? I don’t care, I just want to hang with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about drugs? His tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry, that was me. I had to dope him up to get him in here. Guy doesn’t think he’s sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Who does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The woman you used to live with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s her Indian name. On her driver’s license it’s Stacy. I assume you have a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You believe her over the patient himself. That’s why we’re taking this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The truth, I hear voices. All the time. Telling me to do stuff, it’s crazy, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What happened to “everybody lies”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was lying. Do the things, the, you know, blah blah blah blah blah, all that stuff the other docs did. If that’s negative, ultrasound his belly. If that’s negative, CT his abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast.  Did I miss anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kitchen sink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we could certainly give that a – oh, you minx.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What you’re thinking is, you’re going to save him, be a hero, and win her back. It’s always impressive, that level of twisted narcissism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s married. Big clue I lost the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can’t be within fifty feet of Stacy Warner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought she wanted me to treat him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Treat the husband. Stay away from the wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, you have to treat this like a regular case.  Be yourself: cold, uncaring, distant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Please, don’t put me on a pedestal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We CTed your abdomen. Nothing that would explain the stomach pain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What’s the next move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Leaving. How many more tests do I need? How many more doctors need to clear me before we can get back to our life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Just one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It must be awkward being treated by a man who used to be involved with your wife. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Well, it’s awkward being in a hospital when there’s nothing wrong with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>MRAs were clean, which means he’s probably fine. He doesn’t seem paranoid, he shows no signs of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it means we have no idea what’s wrong with him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ben Goldstein says the schedule’s locked. He can’t do it before tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, today. Call him. Tell him I’ll make it work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> You’re cutting him open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Whoa, hold it! There’s no need for exploratory surgery, Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, I just think it’s premature and maybe irresponsible to do exploratory surgery before we know he’s actually sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it’s premature to put him on a list for hospice care.  And it’s maybe irresponsible to imply my actions are not rationally supported.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>All we have is his wife –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who says that his stomach hurts. Works for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The patient doesn’t even think he’s sick. Why would he consent –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His wife’s a lawyer. She’s very convincing. Call Goldstein, surgery’s on. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Leslie vs. Leslie seems to be right in point, but I’m sure they’re going to try to distinguish it by –  – sorry, they’ll try to distinguish it by relying on the minority opinion. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Double milk, no sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I like sugar now.  Some people would be annoyed by that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know why people sit in waiting rooms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>This is gonna be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People think the closer they’re sitting to the operating room, the more they care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>That’s why I’m here. I’m not moving until everybody sees me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you doing anybody besides Mark?  It’s a medical question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Because if I am his paranoia isn’t paranoia, it’s a justified response? Therefore, not a legitimate symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Knew you’d understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>On the other hand, if it was really just a medical question you would have sent one of your people. Why just push my buttons when you can push theirs, too? ‘Hey, Dr. Mandingo, ask the wife if she’s been messing around.’ You were asking because, if I am unfaithful, I might sleep with you. The answer’s ‘no, I don’t sleep around’. Make sure you note that in his file. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well; he’s in recovery, you can see him now.  Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neurogenic bladder isn’t causing the pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Also doesn’t cause personality changes. On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron’s diagnosis – the patient’s completely healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me the video for the surgery.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Mandingo, you’re needed at the plantation house.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, don’t everybody talk at once. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s nothing there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen. Here’s why I get the big bucks. This is nothing. An enhanced version of nothing.  This is the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tremors in the muscle fiber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s not peristalsis. That’s abdominal epilepsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Means there’s some sort of neurological problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A time bomb in his brain. I forget, who said it was nothing?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves. Probably white matter. Means his axonal nerves are dying. Explains the neurogenic bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enough nerves die, he dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Global axonal nerve death. Likely causes are encephalitis or Alzheimer’s. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Early onset Alzheimer’s. The worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He won’t die right away. He’ll just want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’ll check his blood for Alzheimer’s protein markers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last I heard Alzheimer’s had a genetic component. Patient have parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer’s. And this  still feels a little light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I took a complete medical history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Check out their house. Take Sparky with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They live in Short Hills, two hours away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can expense the tolls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re not interested in the medical history. You’re a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Her secret diary: that’s the main thing. But as long as you’re there, take a peek in the medicine cabinet. Check for toxins, heavy metals… anything that would explain this other than encephalitis or Alzheimer’s.  And get receipts for the tolls! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Making lunch? I assume that’s for Mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You know about his parents. What about further back? Grandparents, uncles, aunts, how’s their health? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Gregg hates fishing. He’s got a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mostly likely candidate right now is Alzheimer’s. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No. There’s been no memory loss. I mean, he forgets where he left his keys, but who doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Any family history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Of? Whacked-outness? His sister voted for Nader, twice. That’s about it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were with House? When it happened? To his leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You’re interested in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We went on one date. It didn’t go very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Our first date didn’t, either. I was never going to see him again. Week later I moved in. 5 years. What would you like to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What was he like before his leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Pretty much the same. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s clear. No Alzheimer’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I figured.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Serious mountain bike. Hasn’t been used in a while, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He switched to yoga. Brand new yoga mat and tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Man’s getting older.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or it might indicate back pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wife would have mentioned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yoga’s good for picking up the ladies, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not when you do it in your own home. The change could just be a change, not a symptom.  Chase!  “Dear House boys, a snack for your highly illegal search. Hope you like oatmeal raisin. Love, Stacy.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Whoa.  In a desk drawer, hidden in the back under some papers. Secret stash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Amphetamines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Regularly used, could lead to neurotoxicity. Explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Fake name, fake prescription.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name’s real. This guy’s just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mark’s a high school guidance counselor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And Mr. Brown’s birth date makes him 17-years-old. You think maybe these were confiscated by a high school guidance counselor?  Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking to yoga, could have been indication –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s getting older. What did the CSF say about encephalitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells, no white cells, serology’s negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means we’re back to Alzheimer’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I told her he didn’t have it. The marker tests were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then you should have told her that. He could still have it. PET scan will reveal any change in metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex, run him through. And check his memory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re going to inject a chemical marker called FDDNP. Then I’m going to ask you a series of questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Test my memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. First we’re gonna map out some specific brain functions, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive.  Checking up on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like all the pretty lights. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay,  here we go. Your full name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Mark Warner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Is your mother living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Limbic system’s intact.  Okay, say you find a stamped envelope on the street. What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Find a mailbox and mail it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Jeez, what a guy. His frontal lobe is working way better than mine.  You remember when you got married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Three years ago this July, who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? There could be a problem with his long-term memory.  Big church wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Is that House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He remembers voices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This serves no diagnostic purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there. Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough.  Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Was she thinking of you? Is that what you medically need to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What jewelry did your bride wear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>She never wears any jewelry. Except that cross her mother gave to her. No underwear, either. At least, not that day. I remember because she ripped her pretty, white dress off in the car. Is that the sort of answer you’re looking for, Doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think I upset him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You gotta to stop this, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I remember the honeymoon was in Paris. I remember because we didn’t leave the room for two weeks. You want the details on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A little defensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not paranoia if someone’s out to get you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here we go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He’s sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Elevate the words all you want, you were just screwing with him. Low even by your standards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Medical screwing. It’s what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And then you run away like a 12-year-old. Go hide on the roof like you always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I haven’t been up here in five years.  I don’t know what’s wrong with him. It’s not Alzheimer’s, it’s not encephalitis, it’s not environmental, it’s not immunological. Every test is negative, every time. He’s perfectly healthy, but his brain is dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It never occurred to me that you couldn’t figure out what’s wrong. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I haven’t given up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>So what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something to change. It’s one of the great tragedies of life, something always , something always changes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Nurse! Nurse! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What happened? What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>My toes. They were numb, tingling, then nothing. No pain, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It’s okay. They’re gonna take care of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I’m scared, Stacy. Hold my hand. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Time marches on. He’s paralyzed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His symptoms mimic a peripheral nervous system under attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But he’s experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can’t move his hands or toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s peripheral. Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, no. I already did an indirect Coombs’ test. No glutination, no antibodies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Initiative! Like that. Start him on IV immunosuppress—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No antibodies means he doesn’t have Guillain-Barre, period!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Period? More like dot dot dot. What if he has the virus but isn’t producing those antibodies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Come on, the chances of that are –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn’t ask about the Vegas line, I said “what if?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It would mean he’s sick and his body’s not doing anything about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So we either fight it for him or it’s fatal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fatal sounds very bad to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But without the antibodies we can’t even test for it. We don’t know if we’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The treatment isn’t all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG. If it works, we’re right. If he dies, it was something else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>So the paralysis might not be permanent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s our hope, but the brain’s tricky. You never know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>With the head, the look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He just wants to talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Well, if it was medical he should be talking to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I’ll be just outside the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Leave! Go talk to him! You’re gonna leave me anyway!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No, that’s not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>You left him, and he had a limp. If I can’t walk, or hold you… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Honey, I’m not going anywhere. I’m not going to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>If I can’t feed myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mark, what you’re feeling, it’s not real. It’s the virus.  Mark? His throat’s closing up, he can’t breathe. Code blue!  He’s having a reaction to the IVIG, I need epi stat!  I can’t get the scope in his throat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s having an allergic reaction and he’s crashing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, he’s not. Look at his vitals. O2 stats are within range. I’m betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms.  Push two milligrams Ativan.  Just a panic attack. Something obviously freaked him out. Can we talk now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You couldn’t just walk into the room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s had five visitors drive down. I didn’t recognize any of them. Six more have sent him flowers, candy and a teddy bear, which I’m sure he finds very comforting. But I didn’t recognize any of the names on the cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Shockingly, Mark has friends, and I have some new ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it’s not shocking that you have new friends. But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I haven’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I didn’t think so. I just think you didn’t tell any of them that you were down here. Now why would that be?  Why would you not tell your oldest friends that you were taking Mark to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital to try to save his life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I’ve been busy! I haven’t kept track of who knows what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, my old friends are telling me to be careful. They seem to think –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He. And he sent me the bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Figures. He seems to think that I’m not over you. It might be dangerous for me to spend time with you. I’m thinking your friends might have similar concerns. And so you didn’t tell him you’d be here, with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What’s your point? That I’m still in love with you? I should abandon my dying husband and we should head for Rio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Gregg, I appreciate what you’re doing for us, but maybe Wilson’s right. Maybe you should just stay away from me. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Love the bear, it was adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My wife’s going to kill me. We’re having company, she cooked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got Mark’s latest blood work, he’s not responding to treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was happy. He’s my patient. I’m sure he’s a good guy, he’s probably a great guy. Probably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I’m just not sure if it’s because I want to be with her or if it’s because I want her to suffer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I’ll be just outside, honey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You two are good together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You know nothing about Mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He took you to Paris, that’s good enough for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>We never went to Paris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your honeymoon. It’s been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No, I had to work. We spent the night in New York, then went back to Short Hills. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>About a month ago. The same time he started getting sick, what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have two more symptoms.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You grilled him about Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever. Yeah, point is he told us everything we needed to know to diagnose him, that is if we use your fancy PET scan as a lie detector. See, it’s a very creative process, lying. Now, telling the truth is a much simpler process. See here. Question nine, this is where Mark gives a long, rambling answer about taking Stacy to Paris. What does the PET scan say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Minimal involvement. Just the frontal and temporal lobes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He said he went to Paris and the PET confirms it, so what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They didn’t go. They didn’t go to Paris, and yet Mark’s brain apparently thinks that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the Bastille.  So we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, paranoia and delusions. Now, here’s the thing about Acute Intermittent Porphyria. It’ll jump you in a dark alley, beat the crap out of you, leave you bleeding. But it leaves gloves, so no fingerprints. Doesn’t show up in blood tests, urine tests, nothing. Unless you catch it red handed in the middle of an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But there are other symptoms of AIP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Such as?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Light sensitivity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, one of the true tragedies of this condition is it makes you want to stick your cool, new mountain bike in the garage and take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga. Start the treatment: hematin and glucose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If you give him hematin and you’re wrong, he dies today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s only one way to confirm AIP: urine sample made during the attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And there’s no way to predict when he’ll have another attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure there is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers. Barbiturates, alcohol, high levels of protein set off an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Which trigger do you think set off Mark’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the faintest idea, that’s why I’m going to give him the combo plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>So if he has this, and you trigger the attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. But then we’ll know what it is and we can treat it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>What if I don’t have this thing and you give me that shot? What happens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No idea. If we don’t know what’s messing up your brain we don’t know how you’ll react.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Okay, I need a minute with my husband.  He doesn’t want the trigger. He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation. If it is the AIP, how much time does he have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No idea. Next attack could be fatal. Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I want you to test him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he doesn’t want me to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I’m not going to sue you. I’m not going to report you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He’s paralyzed! Either you cure him, or he won’t be writing any letters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not gonna do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You keep asking me that question; my answer doesn’t change. I gave him the parameters, it’s his call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You want him to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I diagnosed him, I did my job. You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you’re way better at that than I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Is that what this is? Payback for your leg? How many times have we been over this; I saved your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You’re going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, he’s going to die because he’s too stubborn to make the right choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Now we’re in your territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m respecting your husband’s decision, I don’t see why you’ve got a problem with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-30"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Because it’s crap! Because you browbeat patients, intimidate them, lie to them. If you think you’re right you don’t give a damn what they think. I did what you do all the time, the only difference is I did it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’ll never forgive you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-32"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah, he will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still no change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He’s not getting worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, no change at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And that’s consistent with AIP, right? Until he has another attack his condition’s stable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Mark, you’ve got to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I don’t want to take that test. Not until they’re sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You don’t know Gregg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Not like you do. I only met him when he drugged me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Boy, are my ears burning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Cocktail hour. Just because you can’t hoist a few doesn’t mean you should be left out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Get away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Mark, this is what he thinks is wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>You trust his judgment more than mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>His medical judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>And you’d bet my life on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Smart. Too bad you’re paralyzed.  Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman! Leave the room. It’s not your problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You need the consent from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doc, he ain’t right in the head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then you need a court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, then get one. We’ll wait here. I won’t do nothin’.  Oh, love the Musketeer thing. I got goosebumps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Give me the syringe.]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> Please, if you’re right this may be his only shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what’s your plan? You take the big, dark one, I’ve got the little girl and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough. I can’t do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>You son of a bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See what I did there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-30"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>When does it happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-31"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> If he had AIP, it should have already happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everyone’s different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-33"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is not good. He could have embolism, tachycardia, stroke – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-34"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-35"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two milligrams of Ativan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-36"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Is that an attack? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you’ll pollute the sample! Chase, get urine from the catheter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-38"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not an attack, he’s stroking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-39"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He needs Ativan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is not a stroke! Delta wave bursts just at the base of the spasm. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-41"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Catheter’s out, there’s no way to collect the sample</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-42"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heart rate’s in the 40s, bradycardia, we’re losing him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hold him down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-44"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Give him something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No pain killers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-46"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were wrong! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Straight from the bladder, that’s as fresh as it gets. Will you give him the Ativan already? He doesn’t need to be awake for this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think another light’s gonna make the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Organic chem.. More lights, more oxidation. Ring any bells?  Start the patient on 150 milligrams glucose, 75 milligrams hematin. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What’s so great about you, you always think you’re right. What’s so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time.
