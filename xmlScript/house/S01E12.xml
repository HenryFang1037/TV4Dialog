<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Bryan</speaker><content>Well, you caught the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Well, they’re doing it wrong. I mean, for Hank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Tell the director.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> I thought I’d give the marriage a few months before I’d go for the meddling wife thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>His arm came back day after he hooked up, I say meddle. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Just gas. Go help your man. Give me a little room here to work it out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>TAKE it from ME, HANK Wiggen. Like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bryan</speaker><content> No…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Hey, sweetheart. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Hey. Hi, Bryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Bryan</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>You boys having a little trouble with the big speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Yeah, you got any ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>It’s YOUR story. Just be yourself. Drugs were there, you took ‘em. Simple. Why’d you get clean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Because I was gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>And come April, ’cause you’re clean, YOU’RE starting, opening day, against the Yanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Bryan</speaker><content>Try it her way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Let’s start with the 2nd part first. That’ll get him in the groove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Bryan</speaker><content>Okay.  We’ll do the throwing thing first. Everybody wants to direct…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Warner alright?</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He’s got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, price is not a problem if you have what I need. *Click*</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Osteo-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Young man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if he’s an old man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life, you make him comfortable, send him home, which means you’re just boring me. So he’s young, which means it’s most likely caused by cancer, and you’re here because you haven’t found it. Have you looked really, really hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>MRI and PET scan are both negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Well, let’s see. Born 9/21/77.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s Hank Wiggen?  He signed it, sweet.  “To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine.” You ask for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I-just the Jimmy part. The bone’s too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again. But if we figure out what’s causing the osteopenia, we can reverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Beat the Yankees, and save the free world. </content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sharon</speaker><content>It was a working dinner. My work, company pays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I-I dunno. I just feel kinda weird after what it turned into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sharon</speaker><content>Well, then it stopped being work.  You know, if it’ll solve your ethics problem  you can reimburse me for these. What are they, five dollars and fifty-seven cents, I believe?  You let me know about Friday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mm-hm. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>None of the usual suspects! Age isn’t right, in apparent perfect health before this incident, MRI and PET scan negative for tumors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Test him again, it’s gotta be cancer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late. Car broke down on the interstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cancer. It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, people.  He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You want it to be his kidneys, because if it’s his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it’s cancer, then he’ll never pitch again. If this were a regular guy who came in and broke his arm lifting a box, you would’ve packed him up and sent him home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My God, you’re right, I lost my head. All life is equally sacred. And I promise you, the next knitting injury that comes in here, we’re on it like stink on cheese.  He weighed 175 his rookie year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now he’s 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He let himself go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Steroids! I mean, the guy was a drug user, I’m sure he wouldn’t have balked at pumping up through chemicals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That’d explain the weight gain. And the kidney problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the bone loss. Go ask him what he’s on. When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup.  If your car breaks down, you’re an hour late, not two minutes. And two minutes isn’t late enough to use a clever excuse like car trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was coming in early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huh. Unprompted lies, that’s a bad sign. Either a guilty conscience or something personal’s going on.  See, that’s all you had to do, Just walk in, sit down, do your job. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>No, no, I never took them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’re gonna need a urine sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Oh no, you don’t trust me.  Baby, I’m worried about taking this morphine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>You’re in pain, the doses are monitored. It’s not a slip. Besides, opiates weren’t your thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>They should’ve been. Woah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>I wanna say no, so I am. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Trust is a big issue in early recovery. He really did gain the weight honestly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you say so. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>You’re not getting it.   He thinks I’m an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He sure does. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Should we save the sample? Dr. Sportsfan can put it in Lucite and hang it around his neck. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, Friday night? Can you cover for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think so.  Oh, Friday. No, I’m sorry, I have to go to that oncology thing-that seminar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Dinner with the…drug rep. Casting pharmaceuticals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Arnie? Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes, only tells one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uh…new guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You need cash?…Ah, no, I, I don’t have that much on me…No no, it’s not a problem. No, I’ll be over by 6. ‘Kay. *Click*  5 p.m., Dr. House checks out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s 4:45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was rounding up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Carol Moffett, please see Dr. House in Exam Room 1. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>It’s Carol. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah.  Uh, trouble with the leg?  When’s the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>This Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not much time to fit into that pretty dress, and no time for practical shoe-shopping. You’re running two miles a day further than you should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content> It hurts right here-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the afternoon Cokes, you’re gonna look beautiful.  What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I can’t get my contact lenses out-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>But they’re red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s because you’re trying to remove your corneas.  What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Dentist</speaker><content>Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Symptoms,  we’re working on a personal best here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Dentist</speaker><content>Numbness in my feet and hands, constipation- </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Maybe he doesn’t feel comfortable talking about his private matters-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee!  You’re a dentist. Nitrous oxide poisoning, which means you’re either dipping into your own supply, or you’ve got a bad valve in the office. Laughing gas rehab’s probably more expensive than the plumber. Meanwhile, get yourself some B12.  Who’s left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Student</speaker><content>I can’t see…Nah, I’m just screwing with you.  It’s a hangover, my English Lit prof. told me he’d fail me next time if I didn’t show up with a doctor’s note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note, and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House!  He tested negative for steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Elevated beta 2 proteins, though, could be cancerous. Amyloidosis, or lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He tested negative for steroids. I, um, I have a couple 20s on me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>50 of them?  Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The fat pad biopsy and abdominal CT scan were negative for the cancers, but-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, that just leaves us with steroids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He tested negative for steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there’s one thing they can’t hide…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Dr. House.  And this is the coolest day of my life.  See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content> I am clean, man, no steroids, no nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn’t that a great word? Thanks, we don’t get to say it nearly enough.  Start him on Lupron right away. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids, then you’re giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…No, no, it’s not. It-it’s got calcium in it. It’s very good for the bones.  Basically, on a molecular level, it’s just milk.  How long do you figure before I get a call from Cuddy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You put him on Lupron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And, you told them it was like milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is there any way in which that is not a lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s creamy. But, I had 3 reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Good ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we’ll see in a minute, I’m just making them up now…He lied to me first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don’t make a right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he’s cured. Adds up for me-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Second reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I told him the truth, he wouldn’t have taken the stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And if he told you the truth, what would this stuff do to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…Severe respiratory problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Third reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Excellent!  You and your lawyer can write a paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which brings me to my fourth reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I thought you said there were only three. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you’d buy one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s not gonna sue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because his lawyer is a nice guy, who realizes it’s unfair to blame us for ruining this kid’s hundred million-dollar career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory problems, it means he’s not on steroids, which means there’s something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad. </content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Osteopenia messing his bones up. Hypogonadism. Impaired liver function, kidney function, and…we have managed to find the only professional athlete in the galaxy who is not on steroids. AND it’s not cancer. So, what’s killing him?  Who shares my suspicions that the Yankees were somehow involved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Shrunken testicles indicate his body’s not putting out enough testosterone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don’t worry, I’ll send him a nice note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about something environmental? Arsenic, mercury, the symptoms could indicate-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pretty small environment. Wife’s fine, no one else is sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you throw out the kidneys, everything else adds up. The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function, could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Addison’s disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enough irony for all of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Treatment would cause him to retain fluid. With the kidneys almost shut down already, he’ll die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we’ll get him a new kidney. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your theory is that Addison’s is causing all the symptoms except for the kidney problems. What’s causing the kidney problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He tested nega-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Negative for steroids. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Agreed. He’s not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could’ve caused the kidney damage.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You see, kidneys don’t wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn’t matter, ‘cuz kidneys can’t tell time. Steroid damage could take years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> No steroids. How many times does he have to tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t know. How many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>That is completely different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, that’s right, I remember. You never did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a lawyer-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>If Hank says he never used steroids, that’s the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s too bad. Because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by A, and everything else is caused by B. The beauty of this theory is that we can treat A and B. But if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix, then we are looking at another letter altogether, one that is apparently not in the alphabet. Can’t fix the bones, no more baseball, no more breathing…no more brain function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Get another explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Yeah. Think I’ve got one in my other pants. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Hold on.  Five years ago, Bangor, Maine. My pitching coach had me on something, I never knew what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you never tried too hard to find out either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>I gained 12 pounds of muscle in like, 4 weeks.  I’m sorry, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>How you doin’ Doc?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Very good, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You want me to put Hank Wiggen on the transplant list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, they like to save them for people who have-how do I put this- kidney problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions. Do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s a great idea, we can be the hospital that killed two people. The guy who deserved the kidney, and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren’t even sure what was wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Everything else is related to the Addison’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The test for Addison’s was inconclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The test for Addison’s is always inconclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re not putting him on the list. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s what I live for. Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day. Ask me something I can say “yes” to. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>You’re not gonna tell me it’s a bad idea? Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not my area. That is, however, my chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> When do we do it? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match-</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You writing a book?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That explains it, I told them to put it on my door.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Right. True love. That’s just how we match organs these days. There’s a couple in France-high school sweethearts-they’re trading brains.</content></utterance>

And by better half, of course, I mean the one who struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches and talks a lot less. But I thought I would talk to you first, and alone.  I got your results back from the lab…you DO match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> I, I do? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re also pregnant.  You can’t be a donor.  Not in your current condition. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>No transplant. Lola’s not gonna have an abortion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Actually, your wife just told me that she was making an appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Well, I don’t care what she said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> I think you two need to discuss this further-</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Please tell me I don’t have to decide.  Depends, how long would they live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is this a pragmatic question for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fifty years, no problem. Six months, I say let ‘em die. Well, I’ve actually given this a lot of thought, and my personal tipping point is seven years, eight months, and 14 days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I couldn’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You found religion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you have to be religious to believe a fetus is a life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There seems to be a correlation.  I’m, uh… Do you like monster trucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>…I don’t know what they are. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…Right.  I got two tickets.  Friday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You asking me to go with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Like a…date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. Except for the “date” part.  Forget it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, I-I was gonna go to the oncology dinner…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Course, you have to hear Wilson’s lecture. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why’s his potassium up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Damned if I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> We've got to suck the potassium out of him. We gotta get his heart rate down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Need a crash cart! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s definitely not Addison’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It’s not steroids either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His heart rate is 130 and rising, like a Randy Johnson line drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> A for effort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s no point in doing the transplant. Even if he was stable enough, it’s obvious that we have no idea what’s wrong with him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>First it’s too high, and now it’s too low?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His heart’s not responding to the atropine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Heart rate’s down to 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought it was up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Now it’s down. Last time he went out at 35.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>What’s wrong? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea.  Hit him with the atropine  before he gets to 35 again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ve already given him 3 ml. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently, that’s not enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We can’t stabilize his heart rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did you do to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kayexalate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His pulse was through the roof. So is his potassium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It wouldn’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But something did.  Call me when he’s stable…or dead. </content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>I remember the first time. You weren’t even supposed to be pitching that day. I’d flown all the way to Tokyo to watch this kid, and he gets tossed for arguing a call in the first inning. Ah, your pitches…perfect. Ball seemed to go faster than your arm. It was like the rules didn’t apply, like physics couldn’t slow you down.  Goddamn, it was beautiful. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Hey, Warner. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Hey, kid. How ya feelin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content> I hurt. My arm, my head…everywhere.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>I’ll just try one, Warner. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three more symptoms. Heart rate up, heart rate down, now he’s hallucinating.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not psychedelics, not with the heart symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>All hallucinations would point to digitalis. It would also mess up his heart. But, he’s not on it, and why would he take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…Yeah. Pithy analysis.  I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner. I’m sorry I’m gonna miss it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m sorry about the monster trucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I think it’s great. You’re…giving back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The only thing is… the digitalis…it would only explain the later symptoms, not the original ones. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Sure, it’s got a lotta movement, problem is everybody sees the movement. Yer throwing yer curve ball, like yer throwing a curve ball.  Deception, that’s it.  Same motion, less movement, so it won’t come back at ya.  How’d you get in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>How’s Hank doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lousy.  Around your fingernails, that swelling, it’s called clubbing. Hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends who also had that, tended to frequently grab their chests and die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Yeah, I got a heart condition. What’s wrong with Hank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you take for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>Digitalis. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got ‘em with you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Warner</speaker><content>That’s weird. I just filled this prescription a couple days ago. There’s another bottle here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t bother.  Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what happened? He left the bottle open, while he went to get some water? Next time, just take the whole bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content> Hey man, you got no right-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, people remember how many they’ve got. Date’s right on the label, number of pills, regular person can do the math. But a junkie doesn’t have to. It’s how many pills he’s got left, that’s all he’s thinking about. Bought a big insurance policy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content> This isn’t about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not for you, no. Most reputable stores won’t cash your checks after you’re dead. But for Lola-well, girls like that, they’re all about the money-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Don’t you say that. She already saved my life. I was dead in Japan and she brought me back, everything since then, that’s gravy, it’s more than I deserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You owe her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So, the attempted suicide, the scaring her to death, that’s-what is that, that’s-gratitude? Love? Yeah, I get that.  We’ll take out what you did to yourself yesterday, we’re back to the kidneys and the bones.  I’m scheduling the transplant.  NEVER visit a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>I want that baby!  Even if I’m gone, that’s a piece of me, and Lola. Breathing. Walkin’ around town. Goin’ to baseball games.  If there’s any more transplant talk from you, or Lola, or anybody else…I won’t screw it up this time. I’ll take myself out for good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’ll start treating the Addison’s, which will most likely destroy what’s left of your kidneys-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>Fine. Start the treatment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is it that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No! Not if you like the smell of urine-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Course, why should I trust someone who lies about what he’s doing Friday night?  Question is, what are you really doing Friday night? Or more to the point, what could possibly be better than monster trucks? Or are we breaking up? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>…Stacy’s coming into town this weekend, we’re having dinner. Just…catching up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I definitely had pants here.  Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper? I heard she’s playing Atlantic City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, Stacy the Constitutional Lawyer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You thought I couldn’t handle this news.  You talk to her a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No. It’s been a long time.  If you don’t want me to see her-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What is this, eighth grade?  I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>…It’s fine if you’re upset-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No! It’s… I have no right to be upset. You two are friends.  You should see her. Say hi for me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’m not the cancer doctor who’s lying about the cancer dinner.  I’m not the one who’s betraying all those…bald-headed dying kids.  I’m gonna go get some pants, I stink.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Oh God, do we have to go to the lecture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So, you’re the new Arnie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Sharon</speaker><content>Dr. House. It’s, uh, good to see you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you get me a coffee? Black, no sugar.  Okay, so who is it?  Come on, she’s sleeping with one of you.  Oh God, please tell me it’s you. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m afraid not, no. The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And…you’re Mick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was just in Hank’s room, and he said it smelled like the men’s room at Veteran’s Stadium. He was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy. Well, she’s not. Last six months, she can’t smell a thing. If you think of them as one single patient, add her symptoms to his…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cadmium poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It explains everything. Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How could they have gotten exposed to that much cadmium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, where else is cadmium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Some foods, polluted groundwater, we should check their home-</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>I’m dyin’, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So you’ve got nothing to lose this time. Begs the question… what were you worried about last time?  The funny thing is, when we tested you before, we were just looking for steroids.  What should we look for now, Hank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> Hank?  What’s the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A little weed every now and then when no one was looking? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>I don’t believe this. We quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You did. If you’d kept going, you wouldn’t have just lost your sense of smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>No, I quit the hard stuff.  I just needed to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Based on the symptoms, you’re a lot more than a social user.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> So you’ve been lying to me all this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Hank</speaker><content>…I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There must’ve been cadmium in the soil where the marijuana was grown. Some people get bone loss, kidney failure, some people’s testes shrink, and some people lose their sense of smell. We’ll start treating it right away. You should be fine by opening day. Baseball’s in the summer, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content> It didn’t hurt the baby, did it? The cadmium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you’ve been clean, the baby should be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>Lola</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
