<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content> Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>That's Miss Cindy, Zeke's new aide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content>What happened to his old aide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>She got married.  So, first, you want to rub the glue on the paper in any shapes you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content>Why do people get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Because they love each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content>Why aren't you married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I haven't found the person I love yet, because I spend all of my time loving you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content>Does that mean we can get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Well, love comes in many types, and there's lots of it to go around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Oh, my snow is ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>It's not ruined. Oh, it's pretty.  See, look, I like the green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Jessica</speaker><content>Who ever heard of green snow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>It's magical.  Come here. We'll get you cleaned up, okay? It's okay.  Ooh, are you okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You gonna pay for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice of you to offer. Now I can actually get some cream cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>29-year-old teacher. She works with special needs children. She —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Love what you're wearing. Brings out the blue of the case file, which means it's not from the ER. So why are you here? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because Dr. Cuddy is not here. She's decided to spend some more time at home with the baby for a while. I'm taking over some of her day-to-day responsibilities, like babysitting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. You have your whole life ahead of you. So why would Cuddy want you to die so young?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She figured I'd spent three years working for you. I was inoculated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Fun. You get to exercise your newfound power. I squirm under your thumb, resent the student becoming the teacher, and then push comes to shove, and we all get to realize what our real roles should be. Then you put out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That's why I took the job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>29-year-old Special Ed Teacher coughs up blood all over Corky. No dyspnea, no weight loss.  Why are you smirking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Never thought I'd see the day you were taking orders from Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Cameron's in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When did that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You're gonna destroy her, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am going to do my job. If that involves leaving her a rotting pulp…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron’s gonna mark her territory. She'll probably over compensate and destroy you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bleeding ulcer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Scope of the stomach and lungs were clean, yet she continues to spit up blood from both her stomach and lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That means it's probably something wrong with the blood itself — Leukemia, Von Willebrand's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Thoracic tumor is a better fit. Erodes into her airway and esophagus —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, will you two stop it already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Stop what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Disagreeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Okay, which one of us shouldn't have an opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not an opinion. It's a smoke screen. Toss out a lame idea, instead of agreeing with Foreman's better idea because you're worried that'll confirm that he's boldly gone where no man has gone before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You slept with Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sorry. You were busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Drop it, House. We're seeing each other, end of discussion. Anything else isn't relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's extremely relevant. Apparently, it colors everything. Now I have no idea if you have differing opinions because you have differing opinions or because you're just trying to prove that you can think for yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How about you just judge our ideas on their own merit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you don't want me to do that. Go run a bleeding-time test, confirm our patient's blood is screwy, then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Time zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> I'm impressed. You didn't even flinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I just went to my happy place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> We cannot let House anywhere near this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where is your happy place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>My class. With them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Passed the first mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's a great thing you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Not really. Most kids, typical children, you hand them a pair of scissors, and they cut. Well, Tony, he's got CP and when I gave him the scissors, we went on a journey together, learning to get his fingers in those holes, to hold the scissors apart, to hold the paper. I mean, when he finally learned to cut, we both just wept with joy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If you ever meet our boss, just yes or no answers, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> It's not slowing up. No sign of clotting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So there is something wrong with my blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Don't worry, we'll run some lab tests to find out which clotting factor is off and then —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I'm not worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Must be one hell of a happy place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She's beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know. I'm lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Absolutely. What's she like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's eight weeks old. Are you asking me about her politics or her sense of humor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My cousin had a kid. They acted like they knew the thing from the time it was two minutes old. I just… I just thought…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She cries, she eats, and she poops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't feel anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not sleep deprived. She sleeps fine. I'm obviously not hormonal. I know I'm supposed to feel amazement. I'm supposed to love her. I just… I don't feel anything at all. Sorry. Maybe I am just tired. Um. Thank you for stopping by. I'm okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Lisa… if you're…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I am feeding her, I'm changing her, and I'm burping her. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do. She will be okay. Please go back to work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It is the blood, but the clotting proteins aren't the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's her platelets, looked like they had bite marks in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So now you're agreeing? Either you folded because I gave you crap, or you broke up, or —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We disagree, you blame our relationship. We agree, you blame our relationship. Don't you see a problem there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. Don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not with normal LDH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>ITP fits. We should start her on methotrexate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Absolutely, and total body irradiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Because she failed a bleeding-time test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>TBI will promote cancers, kill her digestive tract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't forget, stop her from bleeding into her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible.  Nobody can stop me from being premature. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got a patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I'm gonna have to call you back.  Methotrexate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nobody. Just because I call him nobody doesn't make me a racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm not gonna play games. If you come to me with a request and it makes medical sense, I’ll say yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can I return my phone call now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Patient won't respond to methotrexate. Bleeding time hasn't improved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Other than that Cameron said you can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She said I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Then why don't we just do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Then why don't we just don't do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I never intended to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is gonna be convoluted, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole "I can control House" thing out of her perky little system. So the next time I went back and asked for something marginally crazy, it would seem marginally reasonable, and she'd say yes. So, yeah, slightly convoluted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Unless we irradiate her. Without the radiation. We book the nuclear lab. We fill out the paperwork. We bring the patient down there. We do everything but flip the switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go. Do. Don't flip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And is there anything we should be doing, you know, to actually help the patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cameron's got the keys to the castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This trial I'm running — the drug really seems to be working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's kind of liking the power. I think I'm kind of liking her liking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not sure what I'm gonna do about Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's sort of dressing like Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's on the placebo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can't possibly know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Accidents happen. I found out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You cannot tell her. You'd be compromising the trial. She knows she had a 50/50 chance of not being on the drug. If you feel like you're lying to her, too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't want to tell her. I want to put her on the real drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And you want me to tell you that that's okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her trial results are already compromised, just from the fact that I know. As long as she's wasting her time, why not give her something that might actually help her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Valid point, except for the fact that it's a load of crap. Don't be an idiot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So how long until we start the procedure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We already started. Told you you wouldn't feel a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You should lie back. Just stay real still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Pan Am Clerk</speaker><content>I'm afraid there is someone sitting next to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Fletch</speaker><content>Oh, for — God, God, God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I have to pee. Can we, like, call a time out for a minute, let me go to the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. We'll just start up again when you're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Thanks. Sorry. I… I didn't realize I had to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sarah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> No pulse. Get the paddles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Clear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Got a pulse. It's not ITP. She clearly doesn't need fake radiation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No structural defects in her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What about a calcified valve or a patent foramen ovale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Transthoracic echo and bubble studies show nothing. Her heart's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The patient said she had to go pee. Maybe when she got up, she started to urinate. Increased the vagal tone, caused arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She didn't know that.  People don't die from peeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Heavy metal, toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Drugs or alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or her own body is making a toxin. Cold agglutinins. Abnormal protein gets activated by cold temperatures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Forbes</speaker><content>Like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table in the procedure room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Causing her heart to race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Confirming our diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>And giving her another heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How in the world could you approve total body irradiation for a patient with possible ITP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was the right call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There is no medical justification for that kind of —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not medically, no. Absolutely no medical rationalization. I had to say yes because House wanted me to say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You think he was bluffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm the new kid. He had to test me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Don't get cute. Don't engage him. Do not play his games, because you will lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You hired me to do this job. Let me do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like you guys are in the middle of a conversation. I can wait till Cuddy leaves.  You are gonna leave soon, aren't you? I mean, the nurses have got your baby out there. Not that they're gonna kidnap it or anything, but I figured that the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to listen to all the cooing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If you're gonna wait, you can wait outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake.  You can't trust that Wilson guy with anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Lisa, are you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's not a big deal. I was having a bad day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>For betraying my trust in a vulnerable time? No. Why would that bother me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He was worried, made a bad choice. It's not a big deal. I know it seems like crap, you probably feel like crap, but it's not. Legally, you haven't adopted her yet. There's no obligations, no strings. It can be undone tomorrow. Emotionally, you'll feel guilty for a while, but the kid… She won't even know you existed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You saying I should give her back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thanks. I'm just gonna go drop it off at the pound. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What did you want?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We got a green light. Go draw the patient's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To see if it clumps in the cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's making you confirm your theory before you treat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She approved the bath. Just thought we ought to do a test to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's more of a yellow light, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So she lets you nuke the patient, no problem, but makes you jump through hoops to give her a bath? Why would she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Forman</speaker><content>I think she was playing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go draw the blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Didn't realize the nurses allowed any visitors in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>They don't.  We'll just do these problems, and then you have to go, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Johnny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I need to draw some blood. I had a crush on my teacher in fourth grade… and fifth.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Well, I wanted to be a sociologist. I was supposed to observe a class. I was sent to room 214, but I went to room 241 instead. It was a Special Ed class, and I just… I just felt at home.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not what this is. Every time a decent person comes in, you set out to prove that they have brain damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I never said her deranged personality was a symptom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The screwed up numbers and forgetting to pee points to her being a human being. The platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or multiple sclerosis. The brain is like the Internet, packets of information constantly flowing from one area to another. Plaques in her brain are like a bad server, slow down the flow. If it's in the parahippocampus, it'll spread to the brain stem, which means it'll be the lungs next. Brain biopsy will show you the plaques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Or we could not cut into her brain. It's just her pancreas. We should do an ERCP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudicate these disputes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not this week, not next week, not next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The number confusions six years ago. You don't think we have time for an ERCP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Stop! We have to assume it's the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, we had to assume it's the brain until we prove otherwise. Do an MRI, T-2 images.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me to do another test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You should be able to see the MS plaques. If they exist, you can do your biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. You wanna say yes. You know you should say yes. But you also think that this job is about standing up to me. So you're not gonna say yes. You're not gonna say no. You're just gonna waste time. And the patient's brain, or pancreas, or whatever is wrong with her is not gonna wait for you to impress your boss. So pick one, either him or me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, he's always cold. He's always an ass, but he's very rarely just wrong. I've read every bonding and attachment book there is. I feel like I'm in prison at home. I feel like I'm free here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Parents make sacrifices.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's on placebo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you want to change that. I'm the last person you'd ever come to for ethical advice, literally, which means you've already asked every other person, and no one's given you the answer you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or I respect your opinion, and I want to hear what comes to your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was mistaken. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Drug gonna cure her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It looks promising, reducing symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No cure then. So, the pros are you might delay the onset of symptoms, give her an extra year, maybe three. She's still dead before you're 45. The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said “brain”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yes, you predicted that her lungs would fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was right about the where, but not the what. A picornavirus could cause localized demyelination that the MRI wouldn't pick up. If we run a nerve-conduction study on the surface of her brain we'll see the dead spots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you talking about cutting into her skull?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>A pancreatic tumor could still fit. It explains the heart, the blood, and her lungs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> You were also proven wrong. Why don't I get a second test?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not searching for MS, but what set it off — equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I didn't realize your patient was a horse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's been human cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not when it's 30 degrees outside. Transmission is by mosquito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection. Whatever it is, it's running rampant in the left side of her brain. When I get in there, I’ll get you the specifics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're asking me to let you cut off the top of someone's head. I need more than, "I'll know it when I see it."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But I thought, because of your illness —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So did I. Even when I didn't know if I had it or not, I just assumed I couldn't take the chance, but now… Even though I know I have it, it feels like… an option.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right now she's just this weird little creature that sleeps and poops and cries. But that… is who she's gonna be. You will be teaching her how to ride a bike, giving her advice about friends and school and having her heart broken. She'll ignore most of it, but some of it'll stick. You're gonna be there for her through all of that. You just have to get through this part. That's all.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Now I do this job. You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head. And the only way I can get at it is to cut it open and rip it out, which is apparently the one test you won't let me run. So either I do this, or I do nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What do you want me to do? Say yes just because you're House?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, she's certainly not funny. Put the phone down. Pick up the baby. Make us all happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Okay, settle down, baby. It's okay. We'll be done in a minute.  House, I can call security. I can —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>BP's dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get it back up. I got a whole stack of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Give her ten CCs dopamine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Already am, thanks. Your baby needs you a lot more than we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You aren't hungry, and you aren't wet. I don't know what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Oh, that is so annoying. Can you make it stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Baby's crying is annoying you?  What's her nerve conduction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>14.3. It's actually speeding up. But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That doesn't make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The fact that you're wrong doesn't make any sense, or the fact that believed that you were right? BP's still dropping. She's gonna stroke. I'm giving her ten more CCs, and I'm putting an end to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay, Rachel, quiet down! I need you to be quiet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Please, turn that phone off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't know what you want! I will give you anything that you want! I don't know what it is! Tell me! Please, just help me! Please!  Really? That worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's stable. We're finished here. Close her up.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How long until we can perform the splenectomy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can't dose her with anesthesia till the last batch completely clears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How come the baby annoyed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We should get her in there as soon as we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Two hours at least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What was different? Our patient loves all things annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She'd love this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's an earth mother, takes in the freaks and rejects of humanity and tells them they're a-okay. So what was different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Move your feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You decided to keep her. Thank you for telling me. You can go now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I talked to her. We connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you trying to annoy me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm trying to explain you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know it doesn't make any sense, but it was real. It was there. You want to hold her?  Come here. Come say hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You think we'll bond?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that cute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I threw up on you, you'd be pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your puke isn't as cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's 'cause of your hips. If she would've just gestated a little longer, her stomach sphincter would be fully mature. But, no, we have to walk upright, which means that baby's head is too big for mommy's hips. And by the way, your hips may be an evolutionary improvement. So we've evolved to find baby puke cute, 'cause otherwise we'd kill them all before they became functional.  Bonding's over. I got to go see another baby.</content></utterance>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So I can just live spleen-free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Plenty of people live perfectly normal lives without —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Spleen's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's not her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course it's her brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You looked at her brain. You took off her skull. You found nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't look in the right part. Didn't look in the heart part.  In the womb, blood has to bypass the lungs, since they don't work yet. When we're born, we take our first big breath, lungs expand, and the ductus closes. Yours didn't. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She has a patent ductus arteriosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus. Blood takes a little detour, makes it leak from your nose, your stomach, your lungs, and, more significantly, keeps it flowing to the right side of your brain and away from your left. Which means that when you get stressed, you get unstressed. That's why you're so good with those annoying kids. And why, when your blood pressure dropped, you were able to identify Cuddy as an annoying human being. Good news is we can fix the heart. Bad news for the annoying kids. </content></utterance>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you. Great work today. I should've trusted your instincts. I will in the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I think I just apologized. If you want, I can get down on my knees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's not because of you. I approved an insane procedure with no proof, no evidence, no —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You made the right call. The problem was a brain problem. Without the procedure, House never notices the increased left-brain function. She'd be dead if you hadn't said yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I know. But… I'll always say yes to House. I studied under him. He's in my head. And if you gave anyone else this job, they would always say no, because… well, because they should. House is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Which leaves me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
