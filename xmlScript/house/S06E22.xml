<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A crane collapsed in downtown Trenton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> My great-grandfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, it's just a book he wrote. Open it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Seriously, you're giving this to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a big step you're taking. I wanted to congratulate you. I understand that's the adult thing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've known for a while. The fact that you decided to cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler. Unless my intel is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trouble in paradise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> We have to get to Trenton.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Young Woman</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That sound like a yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sir, we have to get you to the O.R. You have a bad wound, but we're gonna pack it and transport you as fast as we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Skull fracture. Glasgow coma score of 11. She's immediate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Move on. This guy's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>His wounds aren't so—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Forget the wound. Look at his toes. Atherosclerotic emboli. He'll never survive the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Maybe his shoes were too tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not the shoes. Skin shows smoker's facies. He's not gonna make it till morning. He'll just take up an ambulance ride, surgeon's time, and an ICU bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> He's expectant. Leave him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>I only nodded off for a second. I lost control of the load. I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't worry. We're gonna get you outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's secure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Ready? Three, two, one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Crane operator. Made it through amazingly well. Lucid and responsive. Stable fracture, right humerus. Haven't gotten to his lower half yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Tell me when something hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>I fell asleep, killed all those people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something other than your conscience. Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Caffeine pills. You fell asleep taking these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>I drank two cups of coffee too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that normal for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>No, I hate coffee. I'm working on no sleep. My daughter has the flu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> This much caffeine for a coffee virgin. There's no way he fell asleep. He passed out. Which means a neurological disorder caused the crash, not fatigue.  Hey. We're taking the crane operator back to Princeton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They said he was barely hurt — he can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Steal an ambulance. And call the team. Tell 'em we got a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House. No! I need you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well he needs me there. And he moans louder than you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There were over 100 people in that building. Only 76 have been accounted for. Foreman and your team can handle the crane operator for now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Having fun down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lots! Every time Cuddy leans over a patient, it's another opportunity for a down blouse nip slip. What's going on between her and Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Besides them moving in together? That's not enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave her the housewarming gift earlier. And she paused for a split second, like she was hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's probably her moral revulsion at housewarming gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or maybe she didn't want to accept a gift for something she wasn't gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You actually think they're not moving in together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What was that? You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah. Vending machine collapsed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She still using your ex-wife as a realtor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>As far as I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, know a little farther, will you? Look into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey! There's somebody down here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>If you can hear me, tap three times, or call out. Is anyone there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>I'm not getting anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I heard something — there's gotta be a void down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>There's a million voids down there. It was the parking garage. But equipment hasn't picked up any movement. Dogs haven't picked up any scent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's smashed cars down there. The gasoline throw off their scent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Look, we gotta get back to work, okay? We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anybody hear me? Hey! Anybody hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aah! Oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Help me. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What's your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> Please...my husband's gift. I was supposed to pick it up at the framers. It's on Elm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you should have told me earlier. I could have picked it up on the way. What's your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>It's a picture from our Tortola trip. For his birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not asking your name because I wanna become friends. I'm trying to gauge your mental state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Hanna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, that's a start. What day of the week is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Tuesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Better still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know that giant construction crane next door? It's kind of on top of you right now. Okay, I'm gonna try to pull you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Ow! My leg! Oh! Oh! Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whew… I'm gonna need to get help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>No, stay! Someone else will come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No one knows I'm down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Please! Stay with me. Don't leave me in the dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> No! Don't leave me in the dark! Please stay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's still in the ER House. We haven't had time to start a differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfect! Let's start right now. Put me on speaker.  What causes syncope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Your guy's stable. The two dozen other patients—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who don't need to be diagnosed. They just need to be bandaged. What causes syncope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Vasovagal reaction...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Meningioma, sick sinus syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or you're wrong, and he just fell asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How's he gonna sleep with 50 cups of coffee going through his veins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Were you never a medical resident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hear ten, eleven, and twelve. Where's Thirteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's not here. And the answer to your next question is no. I don't know</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you have the answer to my question after that? Space-occupying lesion in his brain is most likely. MRI will prove I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or it'll just prove he suffered head trauma from the crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which we'd wanna find anyway. Two birds with one scan. Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Having trouble finding a vein for Hanna's IV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She getting weaker? Paler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>No, no. She's stable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That means her blood loss in minimal. Buys us some time. Get the IV into her tibia. It's almost hollow, feeds into the venous system.  Which, they obviously don't teach you in EMT school.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rescue Worker 1</speaker><content>This side's still leaning pretty bad. Gotta shore up this beam. What do ya got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Rescue Worker 2</speaker><content>We need six 4 X 4s…..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told ya I'd be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Heard you might be thirsty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Ahhh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I assume that bodes well for the rescue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Structural beam. High compression concrete. I can't break it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>You can't get me outta here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Naw. Just means we gotta move on to a different piece of equipment. I got airbags comin' in that'll lift 70 tons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>What's your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You testing my mental state?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>I'm gonna be stuck down here for a while. I'd like somebody to talk to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, the guy who just left is the one who's gonna be holding your hand through all this. You talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Little pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> Aah! Oh! Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Big pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>I gotta call my husband. Can I use your phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, no bars down here. L'chaim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't worry. Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I hope I didn't weird you out giving you that gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Can we talk about this later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course.  Is now later? Maybe things aren't going so well with Lucas. If so, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step into anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There's no problems. We're doing just great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So why the weirdness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Can you help?  When I opened it, I didn't think it was a housewarming gift. I thought it was an engagement present.  It just happened last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No wonder you wanna hide this from me... Since I'm such a delicate flower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I didn't know what to say. And I've been slightly distracted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That might make sense, 'cept you're not wearing the ring.  So...You are hiding it, which begs the question—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House...It's in my office drawer because I knew I was coming here. It's not weird. There's no mystery. I'm just getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content> 'Scuse me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content> How much longer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, less than a minute. Are you in any pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>Nothing new. Just a little claustrophobic. Shouldn't you be taking care of those other people, the ones that I hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everything checks out okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Jay</speaker><content>My nose is bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's expected, given the trauma you've sustained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> That's not expected. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>The way things fell, this support beam is now holding up a giant pile of rubble. We can't lift it without jeopardizing everyone down here. So it's time to discuss amputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Please listen to me. You’ve been down here almost two hours. By the time they clear away the rubble—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We are not cutting off her leg.  You don't have to rush through this to make his job easier. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>You kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We leave the leg pinned, we're risking crush syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your leg isn't getting enough circulation. The longer it's pinned the more the muscle dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>So what does that mean, like a limp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dying muscles release poisons. We free your leg, the poisons rush back into your system. It could stop your heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So could cheeseburgers.  Let's get your lazy friends to start moving that pile. She's got two more hours before crush syndrome could possibly set in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>We're digging up there by hand. I can't guarantee I can get 10 tons of debris pulled off in two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Well, you need to try. It's my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content> It's not just crush syndrome you gotta worry about, okay? There's gas leaks. There's fire. We can never rule out secondary collapses, no matter how much we shore this thing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think chopping off someone's limb inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe? Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Those risks are nothing compared to the risk of this thing coming down again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Captain, he's a jerk. But it's what the patient wants. Can we please just give it a couple more hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content> Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I gotta get up to triage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Thank you, doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>House. You don't need to thank me. It just makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Just promise me you won't let them cut off my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I promise. Does that make you feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>For some reason, it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Your phone is working down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Switched carriers. Better rollover minutes.  Talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> MRI was clean, but afterwards, he started bleeding out of his eyes and nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So there was something wrong before the collapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Unless it's just conjunctive coagulopathy from the trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah — you don't think he was sick before. We get it! You're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Brain infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Sorry I'm late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Physical therapy. I left my phone in my locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The infection causes neurological symptoms, goes systemic, and D.I.C. causes the bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good theory. Except for the part that there's no fever. Get an X-ray venogram. See if you can find a reason for your existence. Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Would have seen it on the MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not if you were too busy not looking for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We should X-ray for a facial fracture first. This could all be simple trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just do what I tell you. Be back in ten minutes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>You're leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's a dozen people here who can save you. I'm apparently the only one who can save this other guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>W–wait! Don't go. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hanna's freaking out. She's having a panic attack. She can't breathe. She's gonna rip out all her IVs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So calm her down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She wants you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm flattered. Give her oxygen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They won't let O2 down there. Fear of explosion. You have to go back. She needs you, House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>You only came back because I freaked out. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not at all. I just realized how... big and scary the world is and how cozy and safe this little place is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Thank you. I'm sorry I needed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here. Call your husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> Charlie? I'm here in... They called you? They're helping me. Are you coming?  I don't know how this could happen. It's your birthday. I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? This is why I lied about the phone. Your BP is spiking, so you're bleeding faster from your leg wound. I'm gonna have less time to save it. Hang up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Okay.  Okay, they're telling me I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was stupid of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>It was nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't see that as a contradiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>He was already on his way. He was in Baltimore, and they all saw it on the news. How many people were hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Can I ask what's wrong with your leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Crane fell on it.  Small world.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I'm not in the habit of encouraging my patients' superstitions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>How is that a habit? You plan on getting trapped under a building again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Clean. Now the guy's starting to spike a fever.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He didn't say his neck was sore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's 'cause everything's sore. He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete. Do an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We also have to consider other infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're suggesting we do an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I guess I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Captain McCreaney</speaker><content>Hey, bad news. Because of the collapse, we can't try the airbag again until we get everything off the top. Be five, six hours at least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then we have to amputate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's been four hours already. It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium. If we remove potassium—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not with glucose and Insulin. We have glucose in the kit. There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You wanna dose the insulin here in a non-hospital setting? That is insane! It's not worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Really? 'Cause I think I'm the only one here who knows what a leg is worth. And fortunately, you're not the one in charge — he is. And he knows that I'd testify against him if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg without exhausting every option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Give us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know you're angry, but please don't put her life at risk just to get back at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really?  Wow. So this is all about you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You took her side against me right after you heard about my engagement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That must be it. It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't love you. So just... accept it and move on with your life instead of making everyone miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's great. A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a man-child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Screw you. I'm sick of making excuses for you. I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you and make their own lives worse while they try to keep you from collapsing. I'm done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fantastic. Just stay away from my patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What are you clinging to, House? You're gonna risk her life just to save her leg? Really worked out well for you, didn't it? What do you have in your life, honestly? Tell me. I'm moving on. Wilson is moving on. And you... You've got nothing, House, nothing. I'm going down there, and I'm gonna convince her to let me cut her leg off. If you have any decency left, you'll stay out of it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> Dr. House. Tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hanna... We have to amputate your leg. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>No. You said... that there was time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There was. And it's run out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You asked me how I'd hurt my leg. I had a blood clot, and the muscle was dying. And I had all these doctors telling me I should amputate, and I said no, and they did this... very risky operation. I almost died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> But you saved your leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I wish I hadn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist, and they left me with this, mutilated, useless thing. I'm in pain... Every day. It changed me. Made me a harder person, a worse person. And now... Now I'm alone. You don't want to be like me. You’ve got a husband who loves you. You have friends. You can start a family. You have a life. And this... This is just a leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can't put you out. It could depress your respiration too much. This should take away some of the pain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>Will it be quick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin, muscle, and fat. That should go pretty fast. Then I'll switch over to the electric saw when I get to the bone. It's two bones... About as thick as a broomstick. Takes about as long to get through. I'm gonna cut as close to the concrete, as I can, save as much of your limb as possible. Then the orthopedic surgeons back at the hospital will clean you up, have you fitted for a prosthetic. You'll be running circles around me in no time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>How bad will it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Like nothing you've ever felt before.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Excuse me, officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you mean, officer? How long has there been a cop there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't know. Ten minutes. He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was claustrophobic right before the bleed and before the fever. We told him that he probably did fall asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was his BP spiking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But that didn't cause his first symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it did. All the caffeine. We thought the problem was in his toilet — by that, of course, I mean his head. Which distracted us from the fact that it could have been just a clog in his sewer pipe, and by that, of course, I mean his spinal cord. And blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine. That's why we missed it. He's been sitting ten hours a day. Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run a CT—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content> BP's 72 over 42.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Hanna? Hanna?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Hanna</speaker><content>I can't breathe. I can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Breath sounds bilaterally. It's not another pneumothorax.  Neck vein’s flat. There's no tamponade.  Damn it, I went in too high.  Hanna, you've got a clot in your lung. I'm gonna fix this.  IV streptokinase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>What's happening. What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot. This is a blood thinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Is she gonna be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not busting the clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Maybe it's her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not a clot. It's a fat embolism. From the amputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Okay. So–so what can we do? Come on. Do something. Please, please, do something. Come on, guys, do something. Come on. Come on. Please, come on, do something!  Come on, do something! Do something!</content></utterance>
