<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>That’s okay, some day you’ll be pregnant and you can return the favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>I feel like such an idiot sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>You know, when the baby comes –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>You know what? You are going to be so great. You are. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Uh, uh huh.  Oh, no. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>You know why I pulled you over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>I - I’m so sorry, Officer, I must have, uh, dozed off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>Have you been drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Of course she hasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>Somebody has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>I’ve been drinking.  You all right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>Sir, remain in the car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Hey, listen, she’s not drunk, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>I will arrest you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>She’s sick!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, the good news is, it doesn’t look like a stroke. No bleeds, no clots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>It sounds like there’s bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We got your blood work back. Some things are a little off. Your liver and kidneys aren’t working so well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Why, what would cause that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>It’s preeclampsia, isn’t it? I’m gonna miscarry, aren’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Preeclampsia is a possibility, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>I’ve miscarried three times, I’m 39, we had to use in vitro, you’ve gotta make sure that the baby’s okay –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Let’s make sure that you’re okay, first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How about we take care of both of you at the same time. The nurse will be in soon to draw some blood; I’d like to run some more tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Thank you, Doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Where is everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No one’s in the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, haven’t heard from Cameron all day. You seen House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heh. Look for a shallow grave with Vogler standing over it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have a Stage 4 cancer. It’s metastasized to your liver.  There’s a new drug called 8C 12 that’s shown promise in Phase 2 trials. It’s your best shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been so good to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I did publicly bash your company’s drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>When I think about how I treated you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, hey, come on.  There, there, there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>So, um, there is some hope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Always. But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t thank me. It’s just who I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Up and at ‘em, big guy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, up late. Internet porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How come you’re not in your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on, romance will ensue. My wrist might fall off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hiding because Vogler’s looking for you. That’s just pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence. How is that pathetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here? He’ll find you sooner or later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’m okay with later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> 39-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant, G 4, P 0.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three miscarriages? Gimme. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Altered mental status and complete loss of coordination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tox screen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Negative for alcohol and drugs. She was on oxybutynin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For incontinence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We took her off, but no change. BUN, creatinine are up, LFT slightly elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Preeclampsia. Call the OB-GYN service and rub some prayer beads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP’s normal; no preeclampsia in other pregnancies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because she didn’t carry long enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The three miscarriages make me think it’s an underlying physiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pregnancy-related autoimmunity. Too bad that Cameron quit, I could use an immunologist right now. We’ll see if you’re right; check the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last night. And do an MRA for vasculitis, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There is no way she quit! She got fired because you couldn’t swallow your pride!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An ultrasound? Excellent thought! And put her on magnesium, too, in case it is preeclampsia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sure. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Exactly my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You wanted me to yell at him?  What the hell would that have achieved? What, is he going to jump into his time machine and fix everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When a dog dumps on the floor, do you pat its head and call it a genius? No, you smack it in the nose with a newspaper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dogs can learn things, House can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Coward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Child. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, there! I brought my colleague along to help out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Dr. Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, ultrasound looks good. No sign of fetal distress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>So it’s not preeclampsia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, it still could be, but it hasn’t progressed, at least. We’re gonna put you on bed rest and monitor the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ll give you some potassium and magnesium as well. So, we should keep the fluids running for now and check her again in an hour unless there are signs of fetal distress or – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Honey? Wha – uh, she’s choking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lean forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>What is, is she all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s probably just some muscle weakness. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>What do you mean, probably?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Naomi, open up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>People choke, it could be nothing.  You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>I can’t, I can’t, I can’t even swallow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joel</speaker><content>She gets sick a lot but this, this cold got really bad all of a sudden. And the fever…  Shhhh, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not a cold.  It’s pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pneumonia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax, pneumonia’s her second-biggest problem. She has gone from the twenty-fifth weight percentile to the third in one month. Now, I’m not a baby expert but I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to shrink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, there’s this diet we put her on when we stopped breastfeeding –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joel</speaker><content>But it’s healthy, raw food. We’re vegans. Almond milk, tofu, vegetables…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Raw food. If only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire. Babies need fat, proteins, calories. Less important: sprouts and hemp. Starving babies is bad, and illegal in many cultures. I’m having her admitted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is she gonna be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up. Don’t worry, it’s a vegan IV.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don’t see any signs of vasculitis. Odd, since you’re always right about everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be a different auto-immunity. Or you could bite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Naomi, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>I’m getting cramps. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Strong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Yeah. Feels like my miscarriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s preterm labor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>He’s too little, he won’t survive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s on magnesium already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fuse interbutoline, then. We’re going to give you some medicine, okay? Try to stop your labor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa!  There you are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you. Uh, listen, you said I had to cut one of my people if I didn’t give that speech about your drug, and in fairness to your point of view, my speech really wasn’t the one you had in mind, so I’ve cut Cameron. Now we’re all squared away, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>In the morning, I expect you in my office with your letter of resignation and plans for a public apology, otherwise I’ll destroy you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So that’s a ‘no’ on us being squared away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She might make it to full term. Contractions are less frequent and not well organized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Great to see you back in the office. I guess Vogler found you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, we had a nice little chat. I really should have kept Cameron. She knew where to find the sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s what I said. Preeclampsia. A little stress from the MRA, she pops straight into labor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah ha! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about the myasthenia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Come on, she didn’t seem that weak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She choked, she couldn’t even swallow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What did she choke on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her food. The muscle weakness isn’t a symptom of preeclampsia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What kind of food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A little bit of cooked pear, it doesn’t matter! It shows weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She choked on soft, wet pear. Did she forget to take the bones out? That’s way past muscle weakness. Did you do an upper endoscopy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think there’s something obstructing her esophagus? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’ve gotta talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oooh. We’ve gotta talk.  And check her eyelids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Check her eyelids?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Special board meeting today, only one item on the agenda: you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, enjoy the bagels. I’m untouchable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous. I’ve got you and maybe even Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, well that settles it. Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider will be stymied, go home, curl up on the floor of his shower and weep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What can he do? I’ve got a contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does it say how much your team gets paid? Where your parking space is? If your car should be filled with horse manure? Vogler’s smart; he’s got some plan to get you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does it involve candy? Because I’m a sucker for chocolates. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s doing better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Technically, Alexander Fleming. He developed antibiotics. Pneumonia’s under control, and from now on, what say you stick with human food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joel</speaker><content>Absolutely, swear to God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This time, that’s your guy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Officer</speaker><content>You’re under arrest. You have the right to remain silent…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joel</speaker><content>What did we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? How? We –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is how Vogler’s gonna destroy me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What did he do, grease your cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He had my patients arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He didn’t, I did. The nurses were concerned and they called me. There was evidence of abuse; you took a big legal risk by not calling Social Services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those parents were not abusive, they’re idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, well that’s certainly a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You made the wrong one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, there’s a new biography of Quisling, I think you might like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sure. No idea who that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor. The fact that I have to explain this kind of takes the edge off my flow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was protecting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>From what? Cops aren’t gonna bust me. Disiplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And Vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I don’t give him one, he makes one up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Vogler’s just one vote; he’s gotta convince the other eleven of us. I’m just trying to stop you from making that extra easy. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sean, do your wife’s eyelids look any different than usual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Um, maybe one is drooping a little bit, but you know, she’s tired, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Naomi, can you open your mouth for me and tilt your head back? This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, there’s swelling, indenting the esophagus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Is that why she choked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ll need to do an x-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>What? No, the baby – you said no x-rays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s important.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Three centimeter mass in her right upper lobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a granuloma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. There’s no calcification.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s small-cell lung cancer. The tumor’s starting to press against your esophagus. It hasn’t metastasized, but it has spread to other parts of your lungs so we can’t operate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Wait, that doesn’t make sense. She had kidney failure and brain problems…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Some cancer patients get what are called paraneoplastic syndromes. You were making antibodies to fight the tumor. It attacked other cells: your brain first, then your liver, kidneys… even the nerves that control your eyelids. That’s called Lambert-Eaton syndrome, it told us the tumor was in the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>How bad is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Small-cell is the most aggressive kind of lung cancer. The five-year survival rate is only about ten to fifteen percent, which is why we need to start you on chemo and radiation right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>Not radiation, what about the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’ll need a C-section before you can start the treatment; I can get you in first thing tomorrow morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>What are the chances my baby will survive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Pretty good. Twenty-eight weeks, so about eighty percent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>No, wait, that’s one in five chance he’ll die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I really wouldn’t advise waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Naomi, you’ve got to start this treatment right away –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Naomi</speaker><content>What happens if I wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Twenty-nine weeks, survival rate is closer to ninety percent.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>As most of you know, Gregory House recently gave a speech about me.  I’d like to return the favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Dr. Wilson. I was hoping you were going to miss this one. A man is the sum of his actions. Here are a few of Dr. House’s. He violated a DNR and was charged with assault. He brought a termite into the OR and spat on a surgeon. He accepted a Corvette from a patient who was a known member of the New Jersey mafia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Edward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>These are the last three months. He’s personally had more complaints filed against him than any department in this hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, he’s screwed up. He’s miserable, and he should probably reread the Ethics Code, but it works for him. He’s saved hundreds of lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>He is a drug addict who flaunts his addiction and refuses to get treatment. He is a disgrace and an embarrassment to this hospital. I’d go on, but it gets kinda mean, so I’m gonna keep this simple. House goes, or I go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You shouldn’t personalize this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>And by I, I mean my $100 million. How’s that for personalizing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You gave us that money for a reason. Are you really willing to throw it all away because of one doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Gregory House is a symbol of everything wrong with the healthcare industry. Waste, insubordination, doctors preening like they’re kings and the hospital their own private fiefdom. Healthcare is a business, I’m gonna run it like one. I hereby move to revoke the tenure of Dr. Gregory House and terminate his employment at this hospital, effective immediately.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>We’re gonna take another vote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, first of all, you can’t void my vote by making me stand in the hallway. And second, you should check the by-laws. You need notice and at least one business day before you can reconsider any matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>We’re voting on a different matter which you are… conflicted out of.</content></utterance>

You don’t spit on the man who signs your paycheck. First Cameron, then Wilson – you’re next.  Pull your pants up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So it’s about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Of course it’s about the money. The money Vogler gave, he could have bought a few jets, maybe a baseball team, or just stuck it in Chase Manhattan and collected interest. But he gave it to us to buy equipment, to do research! You are a great doctor, House, but you are not worth $100 million.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It’s an embolism. A blood clot. It’s fairly common with lung cancer. It’s not a full saddle embolism, so blood’s still trickling through. We’ve been able to get Naomi breathing a little, but we need to remove the clot, and we need you to approve the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Yeah, whatever you have to do, just do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not that simple, okay. The best course for the baby would be an immediate C-section. The longer we postpone, the greater chance it’ll have brain damage from lack of oxygen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Fine, whatever, just do it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you stay here.  Keep her as stable as you can for as long as you can.  She had trauma during the procedure. She’s bleeding into her abdomen. There’s nothing we can do; I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Um, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need you to okay the C-section.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s gonna kill her, right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>She makes the decisions, and I’m –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, and that’s gonna be tough from now on, but this decision is easy. You know what she’d want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-31"><speaker>Sean</speaker><content>I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You make this call, only two things change. One: yeah, you feel guilty for killing your wife. Two: your baby lives. Naomi’s baby lives.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don’t want to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s about a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The pregnant woman? She wasn’t qualified for that trial and I’m not going to apologize –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not talking about her. At this point I think it’s best that I concentrate on patients who are still alive.  Pulmonary embolism. She bled out. Saved her son.  This is Olive Kaplan’s CT scan, the incredible shrinking baby. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Her thymus gland –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>DiGeorge Syndrome. It’s genetic, can cause the gland to wither to nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is why she couldn’t gain weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’ll call the police and Social Services and have all the charges withdrawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve sent a test down to confirm; when it comes back you should start Olive on immunoglobulin replacement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re not going to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume I won’t be here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>It’s the same motion as yesterday, people, same reasons. All those in favor of dismissing Gregory House raise a hand.  Dr. Cuddy, you realize this is going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>You can’t abstain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m not abstaining, I’m voting no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>You’ve changed your mind since yesterday? What did he do, buy you dinner and roses? Threaten to drown your dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He did his job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Right. He saved another life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Good for him. It’s great. It’s not the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s what we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>And you could do it a lot better if you didn’t have to worry about some madman running around the hospital accountable to no one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But that’s not the choice you’re giving us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>House won’t listen to anyone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you’re not accountable to anybody, either! Because you think you own us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I move for the immediate dismissal of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you think House deserves to go, if you think I deserve to go, Wilson deserved to go, then vote yes. But if you’re doing this because you are afraid of losing his money, then he’s right! He does own you.  You have a choice. Maybe the last real one you’ll have here. </content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy is a genius,  convincing four people to give up a fortune to save our sorry asses.  Dr. Cuddy!  The man of the hour. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re drinking. I would have thought that was pretty obvious. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, to the great champion. Saved you, saved Wilson, saved the whole team.  Of course, none of them would have needed saving if you could actually get along with another human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, thank you, Miss Buzzkill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you only cost us $100 million. Could have saved some lives, could have made a few jobs, helped a few people. Yippee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You voted to get rid of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The lesser of two evils. You should be mourning. I know I am.</content></utterance>
