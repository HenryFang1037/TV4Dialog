<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Uh...I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Do you want me to use my butt again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I don’t know how I got here.  How many drinks did I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Your scotch hasn’t even arrived yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That means I was drunk when I got here.  8:50.  I remember being at work. I’ve lost at least four hours.  Say five words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content> What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That’s four words. The accepted diagnostic test for global memory impairment is five random words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I’m... Trying to find that out. Give me five... Animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Um...Cat. Bird. Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Monkey, Rhino...  Either I’m massively drunk – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content> Oh, you’re bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Or it’s someone else’s blood. Do you see a wound?  How bad is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>It’s all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I have a concussion. Retrograde amnesia.  I have no keys, no phone. I’ve been mugged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>No you haven’t. You already gave me a twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Did you earn it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Someone is going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content> Kenny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not you. I saw something, a symptom. Someone is going to die unless I find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>DANCER</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I have no idea. Keep the change.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I saw somebody dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You saw thirty people flying into glass and metal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I saw a symptom before the crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You're concussed. You don't know what you saw and you don't know when you saw it. A week ago, you noticed a symptom in a soap star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Bad argument. Since I was right about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>But your brain obviously thinks it happened last night. Wires are crossed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> That's all of it. A few stitches will hold your brain in place. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Hey! Hold your head still unless you want me to sew your nose under your eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why was I taking the bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Because you were drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Perfect. Uh...Uh...You.  Get histories from everyone in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Did you just forget his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No.  Lesbian. Find out if anybody on that bus was taken to other hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>You just forgot mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, Thirteen. I just wanted to call you a lesbian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I'm not a lesbian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was rounding up, from 50%.  Find my cane and motorcycle. Figure out where I went last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Where’s your cane and motorcycle? And where’d you go last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You’re going to trust me? I lie about everything. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>How much bigger could it get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You don’t think it's –  A little weird that there’s both a giant crash and a simultaneous, mysterious symptom sighting? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What if it’s not a coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You mean like the hand of God reaching down and screwing with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>That... Or the symptom caused the crash.  Did you see anybody in a bus driver’s uniform?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Right here. Purpura on Ralph Klamden’s neck, indicative of leukaemia. Caused a bleed in the brain, and hence the accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Indicative of wearing a seatbelt. It’s just a bruise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>I have leukaemia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, we just ruled that out, pay attention.  He probably had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>I didn’t have a seizure. I got hit by a garbage truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Which you drove into while you were seizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You saw the bus driver exhibiting the initial stages of a seizure and didn’t bother telling him to pull over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Hey!  Nobody leaves here until I say they can be discharged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>WHEELCHAIR GUY</speaker><content>She said I was –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Is she me?  You have a fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>WHEELCHAIR GUY</speaker><content>No, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>NURSE</speaker><content>98.6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I need him to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>NURSE</speaker><content>Pulse is normal. BP’s normal. Everything’s normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>WHEELCHAIR GUY</speaker><content>I just have a stiff neck from the crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Stiff neck.  This man has meningitis. We need to quarantine the whole ER. No one leaves here until their full workup is complete.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>You left here at 5:23 p.m. Your motorcycle never made it home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can’t remember. Where else did you look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>We did pull up a list of all of the injuries. Twenty-two victims were brought here, injuries ranging from a broken pelvis to a severed right foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>The other eight were taken over to Princeton General.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> It would be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Twenty-something year-old Jane Doe. Kidney contusion, laceration on her leg –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>The weirdest thing we’ve got is a ruptured spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, new plan. We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site. Find out where I went, we go there –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>On it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You’re not going to do anything, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>We’re going to go to the ER and do our jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Someone is dying because I can’t remember –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>When you remember, you can page us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> The shortest distance between here and your memory is straight through your prefrontal cortex. All we have to do is access it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Great idea. I’ll build the giant submarine. You get the miniaturization gizmo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Medical hypnosis can bring the brain to a class II theta state, increasing focus and memory retrieval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You’re not doing to make me do the chicken dance, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Someone on the surgical department must be trained.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> Just relax. Keep letting go of any intrusive thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> So what, you saw an ad on the back of a comic book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Shh… I did a rotation in Melbourne. Focus on the sound of your breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You're taxing an already injured brain. It’s like telling him to walk it off after a broken ankle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Wilson is done talking now.  Visualize the bus. The way it looked. The way it smelled. The people on it. What they look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>This is a waste of...  Time.  Cool. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Focus on the details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The bus is empty. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Is this really working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CHASE </speaker><content>Shh.  Just focus. Clear your mind.  Think back to how you felt. Details you saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I can't see out the windows, and I can see you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Memories further from the incident should be clearer. Where were you before you got on the bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why did you get so drunk at five in the afternoon, alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I need a reason?  God, I hate 'beer' brand beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> When he's hypnotized, can he lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>He...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I can be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Is he lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What are you running away from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Do you see anyone in the bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus? Say something to make me focus. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>He's concerned about you. Why does that mean he's insecure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Will you get your girlfriend out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>It's a legit question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Amber's there? You've got Amber in your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You put her in my head. I can't even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Well she better have her clothes on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Unfortunately.  I didn't mean to say that out loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Say what out loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I didn't say it out loud? Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What's going on in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> If I can't lie, I need these two out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber for now, shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I wish it were that –  That's some program they got down there in Melbourne.  Cheers.  I remember the bartender.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Good. Now you're accessing your temporal lobe. Does the bartender have any odd symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He seems fine.  Anybody here sick? Anyone here taking the bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>You are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Because... You took my keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Good. This is good. Now we can retrace your steps. Let's go back to the bus. What's in front of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Passengers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Anything, special about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Some emo guitar hero wannabe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You're focusing on him, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You a nose picker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>EMO GUY</speaker><content>Do I have to answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If the answer was no, you would have answered. Tilt your head back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>He’s fine. He doesn’t even have meningitis, just like everybody else we’ve had to give meningitis shots to.  You can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You have a brain tumour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>EMO GUY</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If I was kidding, I’d be dressed like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You’re fine. A nurse will sign you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Go home. Have fun. Relax. I’m probably just a nut case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Tilt your head back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You can get your things and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> You need to rest. I’m admitting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content> Oh! Oh! I can’t get up. I can’t move my legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Your legs are not your biggest problem. Your biggest problem is... I don’t know what your biggest problem is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, we have the who, but not the what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>We’ve only got one symptom to go on. Sudden onset paralysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We actually have two symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Only one that we remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>You did a full work up on the guy. Did you find anything? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>CT ruled out subdural hematoma, stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Guillain-Barré fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I’m just trying to figure out what Guillain-Barré looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>You can’t just eliminate everything because it doesn’t match what you might have seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>How about because it doesn’t match what I could have seen? Guillain-Barré has no external physical manifestations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Everything has some external physical manifestations, and you’re obsessive enough to notice any of them. Which means there’s nothing we can rule out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Elevated white count means transverse myelitis is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Sudden paralysis while driving a bus. That’s the sort of subtle clue that only a genius would have noticed. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Are you sure you’re feeling okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>To smell a bus, obviously. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll uh, start him on antibiotics in case it’s transverse myelitis. You guys go sniff a city bus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Why are you smelling the passengers’ clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory.  I need to get back on that bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Okay. So why are you taking so much Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>You split your head open, you should rest.  Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>A hint of... Exploded bus. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>House, that’s four Vicodin in forty seconds. At this rate...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Wish me luck. I’m going in. Rambo style. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>House, do you think this is going to work, or are you just stoned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Both, apparently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>You’re wrong. It’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So, you’re saying I’m not here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>If this were a real memory, you’d be limping.  And you wouldn’t be talking to me. I’m obviously a hallucination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We’re both in my head. You’d think one of us would have noticed the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>Why haven’t you had a head CT yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>Dumb question. The brain’s too fried during a seizure to form memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Dumb answer. I wasn’t asking you, I was asking me. Because you’ve already proven that you're not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>I’m getting a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Is that a clue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>BUS DRIVER</speaker><content>Again, I’m not here. You’re getting a headache. Stop arguing with a hallucination and get some treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>MYSTERY WOMAN</speaker><content>He can’t.  The hallucination is your messed up brain’s way of reasoning out a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You weren’t on the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>MYSTERY WOMAN</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Five hundred dollar shoes. Not on a Princeton cross-town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>MYSTERY WOMAN</speaker><content>Must be another reason why I’m here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes. What do you have to tell me?  I was talking to the passengers on the bus!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You were hallucinating. You’re getting an MRI.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Stop fidgeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>If you haven’t found the bleed yet, it can’t be –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>There’s edema, and localized swelling in the section of the temporal lobe that controls short-term memory. Also, the penis size cortex is set to pathetic. What didn’t you say out loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Very little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>When you were under hypnosis, you were talking to Amber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I wanted to see her naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Seriously, what were you hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I want to see her naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You want to see everyone naked. Why would you hide that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Well some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends. But if you’re okay, I’ve got a digital video camera. So we could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why would I be upset that you’re treating my girlfriend like you treat every other woman on the planet, unless...You’re not? Unless it’s deeper than that. You WEREN'T objectifying her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Trust me. I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
