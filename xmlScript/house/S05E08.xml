<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah "I didn't" or yeah "I did"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whichever one means you almost had me convinced it was a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh. (He lets go of the elevator door, which starts to close. House prevents it from closing with his cane]</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>16-year-old girl with fluid in her lungs. No previous trauma, lung, or cardiac issues. Gram stain was negative. No bacteria, no pneumonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's a factory worker. Means she probably works close to a lot of recent immigrants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank God some of those offshore sweat shop jobs are coming back to America. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She's an emancipated minor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In a factory? Either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a child star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Her parents died last year. No relatives. To avoid foster care, she got a GED and got emancipated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could have picked up a parasite from a co-worker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She'd be having GI problems. Pregnancy's more likely. Sparks a fluid overload, hits the lungs, causes the pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Her history says she's not sexually active.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And our history says she could be lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>But not every teenager is having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But every teenager is stupid. Teenagers on their own are stupider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The girl's holding down a job, makes her rent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> On the one hand, Kutner’s right. Maybe she's a sweet young thing, not a screw-up lying through her teeth. On the two hand, a pregnancy test only takes five minutes, and we no longer kill rabbits. So in conclusion, shut up, do the tests. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Drugs could damage the heart. Pressure imbalance allows fluid to build up in the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Tox screen's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>For drugs used recently. Not for drugs used before recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>16 doesn't automatically mean a risky lifestyle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't we just have this conversation? Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't. So, in conclusion, shut up. Check her home and work for toxins or drugs. Kutner and Foreman, do an echo. Find the extent of the heart damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kutner can do the echo on his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes… But he'll be very lonely. So I have to ask why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I've been asked to help run a clinical trial. That okay with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good for your career. Great for your street cred. What's in it for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have four doctors and never more than one case. It means I have time to work on other things. And they'll have more chances to step up. Stand on their own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And if there's an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If there's a problem with Sophia or any other patient, you know I'll be there. The patient is my priority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No.  Oh, do you want a reason? Clinical trials take time. Your time is my time. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I told you, I don't do drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Still a good idea to check your heart. Something else could have damaged it. You find it hard being all on your own? Having to do everything without —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Drugs to ease my pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That's not —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Teenager on her own? I wouldn't trust me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I meant it must be hard. No one there to back you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I know you're trying to be nice, but I'm not into the whole pity thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I was actually doing the "I get it" thing. I lost my parents when I was six. It doesn't go away. But it gets easier. You learn to deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content> I still get nervous when there's a knock on the door. Always think it's the State Trooper… With more bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You already got the worst news and survived. That's sorta the upside.  Your heart's healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Isn't that good news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>For your heart, yeah, but it also means we still don't know what's wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Checkbook balanced, place spotless. Looks like she builds her own furniture. If you're this grown up at 16, what happens at 30?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You turn back into a kid. Like Kutner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Kutner's not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He needs everything to be nice. He wants to see the best in everyone. Kitchen's clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, friendly is a dangerous thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There is such a thing as too trusting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Corollary is there is such a thing as not trusting enough. Too much, you get hurt. Not enough, you don't live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So the object in life is to get hurt just the right amount? Excuse me if I don't go out of my way to take relationship advice from you. And trust…  Should be earned.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Bong means nothing. Drugs are irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Relevant if she's taking them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Even if she is: Irrelevant. Echo showed no heart damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would that be the echo that Foreman chose not to run with you after I dashed his new drug discovery dreams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You mad at me because you think Kutner screwed up the echo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I didn't screw up the echo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. No structural heart damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So if it's not the heart…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Didn't you just say it's not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Irregular heart beat would account for the pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The edema was acute. Vasculitis makes more sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There's no sign in her blood work. And if she had vasculitis, she'd be too weak to work in a factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She builds her own furniture. You think she skips work because she's feeling a little weak? She needs steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er. Foreman. Start her on beta-blockers.  The rest of you, do anything that isn't starting her on beta-blockers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Start her on the treatment. Page me if you need me. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Irregular heartbeat causes blood to back up behind the heart and into the lungs. The beta-blockers keep this from happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I thought the test showed my heart was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's tricky. An arrhythmia can come and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>So you don't believe me or the test. You guys are more cynical than I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We found the bong in your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>You went into my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Extended drug use can damage —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>The bong belongs to my ex. It's why he's ex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>That doesn't mean you didn't use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>No. You have no reason to trust me. You have to do your treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The other possibility is you have vasculitis. The treatment for that is steroids. If you've been using drugs, if they've damaged your heart and I start you on steroids, they could kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I haven't used drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> I'll get the steroids. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I owe clinic hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm here because House doesn't want me to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm guessing he said no to the clinical trials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He didn't need to say no. He just wanted to say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House did something solely out of self-interest? That's freaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't suppose you'd want to override?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. What do you think this is gonna prove?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Does it matter?  Just figured you could use some help down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you spending two hours wiping noses will annoy House. If that is your dream, God bless. If you want to prove you can do his job and something more… </content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>His puke is red. That's blood, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> That hurt? What about that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content> Four days he's been like this. It's just getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Maybe he just needs to poop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Evan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>What? Worked last time I had a stomachache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's actually a smart idea. Which is why that's the first thing the other doctors checked.  His insides are clear.  Anyone else sick at daycare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How 'bout his friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>No. No one. What's happening to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not sure yet. Don't worry. I've got an idea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You can make him better, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's my plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>You need to make him better.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Stay the hell away from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Just calm down.  What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>I adjusted her IV, and she went crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Don't touch me! Leave me alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Sophia, it's okay. We're here to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Just stay away from me! Don't touch me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I said, don't — Get your hands off of me! Get your hands —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Beta-blockers don't cause psychotic breaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She's not on beta-blockers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We started her on haloperidol. She's stable. Lab tests showed the delirium wasn't caused by a metabolic problem. Means we still don't know what caused it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I didn't switch her meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But your decision to stick it to the man clearly inspired Oliver Twist. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I treated her based on the symptoms she presented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She wasn't on steroids long enough for it to cause the delirium — it's a new symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>One that rules out vasculitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>And arrhythmia. The psychotic break caused a surge of adrenaline, but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's not the problem. We're both wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what causes lung issues and delirium? And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Prinzmetal angina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful. If you'd run the echo that you didn't run before giving her the beta-blockers that you didn't give her — If you'd listened to what Kutner just said, you'd know it's not a heart problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm not talking about her heart. I'm talking about her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Prinzmetal angina doesn't affect —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm. Leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing. And when I say Foreman, I mean… Foreman. I want his signature on the paperwork. I want videotape.  I want photographs of him with the patient on today's newspaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Set her up. When you're ready —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>House wants you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To do the procedure. When you get everything set up, page me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>That's really a camera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pretty cool, huh? This can go places the other scopes can’t. Jonah, I need you to swallow this pill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Jonah</speaker><content>Don't wanna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It doesn't hurt. Promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Jonah, please. This will help make you better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't want to be mean, but, if you don't do this, we'll have to make you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>It's a power pill. It's not just a camera. It makes your muscles grow. Like the vitamins we take.  Except this  was made with a secret formula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content> You did great, sweetheart. You're very brave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Jonah’s lucky. I was pretty cruel to my little brother when I was your age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I guess I thought that's what big brothers did. Obviously, I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Evan</speaker><content>Is he a doctor too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Does the pill tickle, sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He can't feel it. What's funny, your brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>What's happening?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And you suddenly care why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House was asking questions last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I assume Foreman needs us, and he's worried that if we're sniping, we might be distracted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's kind of insulting, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're obviously fine.  I need a differential for uncontrollable giggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> He's four. They laugh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. Nothing like diarrhea and bloody vomit to put you in the mood to goof around. I've looked down one end and up the other. All the tests came back clean. I can't figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You can't? Don't you work with three other doctors and a grouchy gimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This isn't House's case. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Just so you know, whatever you're trying to prove, it won't be enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Gotta go. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You didn't miss much. No spasms yet. Nothing in the anterior or posterior cerebral arteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>How much longer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Just a few more minutes. Were your foster homes all around here, or did you have to change schools?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Is chatting about lousy foster parents supposed to relax me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Left middle cerebral artery looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> My foster parents were great. I think most foster parents do it because they want to do something decent.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Came to my house. I cried into the guy's shirt for an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> fMRIs tell us where the blood flow is. You were using your limbic region. It lights up when we use our imagination. It doesn't light up when we're telling the truth. Your parents aren't dead, are they? I risked my job, put you on a different treatment —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I didn't lie about the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Then why lie about your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Because I wish they were dead. I got emancipated because my dad raped me. And my mom pretended it didn't happen.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No signs of spasm, impeded blood flow, or brain dysfunction. It's not Prinzmetal’s. All the fMRI showed is House was right. She was lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We find out our patient's been raped, and that's your response?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart. Maybe if we all stopped wringing our hands, we could solve this thing and let her live to have a few more nightmares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Gonococcal endocarditis would explain the pulmonary edema, the delirium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No sign in her bloodwork. Could be lying about the rape.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her whole life's a mess. What rhymes with mess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not stress. She has none of the usual manifestations. No hormone imbalance, no cardiac —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious. She's a picture of emotional health. Severe emotional stress can lead to asymmetric function of the midbrain. Explains the delirium. Interruption of the brain-heart coupling could cause pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Even if House is wrong, the treatment's basically anti-anxiety meds. Hard to argue with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. I agree. It does explain everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it.  Thirteen, make sure he makes sure.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So what messes with her lungs, her mental status, and runs her blood through a wood chipper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Factory lunch rooms aren't the cleanest places. Coulda picked up E. Coli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or shigella from the restroom. Either would account for the red cells, the delirium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But not the original lung symptoms. Legionnaire's could, and cause delirium.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The desk did. Looked like she had stapled stuff all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Holes means that it was pressure-treated. Sawing or burning it releases arsenic into the air, into her lungs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So, what does arsenic treat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Syphilis. Before penicillin, the treatment was arsenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We already ruled out STDs, and even if we were wrong, that much arsenic in her system would've wiped out the syphilis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>To protect myself. So they can't find me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We can protect you. But we need to find your parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Why? You have my blood. You don't need my name to find a donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're a minor. You obviously forged the emancipation papers. Even if we had a donor, we'd still need your parents' consent to treat you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Can't you just pretend you didn't go to that house? That you didn't find that girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Calling your parents doesn't mean a family reunion. You don't even have to see them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content> When I get sick enough, it'll be an emergency. You'll have to give me a transplant. Even without consent.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She'll reject it. And she'll be too weak to try again when a better match turns up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not scared enough. Tell her the thing about emotional reactions is they're definitionally irrational. Or stupid. Might wanna phrase that in your own words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She wants to deny her parents the satisfaction of saving her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's your rational explanation of her emotional response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That was her explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That makes sense. How long did it take her to come up with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was her immediate reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That doesn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The fact that it makes sense doesn't make sense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Emotional is immediate. She went to rational first. Means there was no emotional to process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're saying she's lying about being raped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn't be her first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She lied about one trauma to cover a worse trauma.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Believe whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're scared, and stubborn, and you don't like people feeling sorry for you. Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I don't want pity. I just wanna be normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you know you're not.  You need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping. So they won't see the lost, hurt little girl.  Because that's not what you see. You see someone who did something terrible… Who deserves to suffer. Who doesn't deserve to live.  What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eventually, we'll find your parents… If only to deliver the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>Then they won't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're an idiot. You'd rather die than face your parents because, what, you broke their Faberge egg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I killed their son.  I killed my brother.  I was supposed to watch him.  He was in the bath.  I could hear him laughing.  Every time they look at me, it's like I kill him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If you don't take your parents' bone marrow… You'll be killing their other child. If they don't hate you now, they will then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Sophia</speaker><content>I don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure you do. You want someone to tell you it was just an accident. That it's not that bad, well, it is that bad. And you know it. There's nothing you can do to change that.  But there is one thing you can do, to not make it worse.</content></utterance>
