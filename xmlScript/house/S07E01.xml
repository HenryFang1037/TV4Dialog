<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You think I can fix myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I just need to know if you and I can work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content> Let me see.  It's okay.  It's gonna get infected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hey, you're not gonna...  You are.  No. Don't, don't.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So now what?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content> Everything's good. We don't have to talk through it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, I meant it literally. Now what? We could make breakfast. We could go bowling.  We could stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I have to go home and get dressed and go to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So that's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm hoping this is the beginning of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Yeah.  Your assistant's new. It's a 50/50 chance he just... can't find the light switch.  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, this is Dr. Cuddy's nanny. She's, uh, feeling a little under the weather now, so she won't be coming in today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Oh. I hope she's all right. Would you mind asking her if—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No. Can't do that. I'm afraid she's locked in the bathroom. Terrible bug going around. What's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Well, I'm sorry to disturb her, but it's Dr. Richardson. He must have the same stomach flu. He threw up in the O.R., and I'm not sure how she'd want me to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Hold on a second.  I've talked to Dr. Cuddy, and she would like you to do three things : One — send him home, two — sterilize the O.R., three — use your own brain. See ya.  It's about puke. That's what's so important. Puke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, I guess I don't have to rush back in. But whatever "now what" we do decide on... It comes after you take a bath.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Here's one. 25-year-old man with numbness and tingling in his legs and a speech disorder, three— "</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Anybody see House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>It's 10 :00 A.M. I'd be worried if he was here. This 25-year-old—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>He was in pretty bad shape yesterday after his patient died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>House has lost patients before. We all have. He's a big boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You didn't see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Best thing we can do for him now is find him a new puzzle to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Thus bringing us back to my 25-year-old—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Yet you're the only person here without a potential case in front of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I haven't found the right one yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Oh. I–I thought maybe it was because you were asking for a leave of absence and wouldn't have time to see a case through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>I didn't say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He didn't...I saw an envelope on House's desk with your name on it, so naturally, I... steamed it open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What's wrong with you? You steam an envelope to keep it secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Which is why I just ripped it. You gonna tell us where you're going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content> Sure sounds like a no.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>There's glass everywhere. Couldn't you have just put the mirror down nice and gentle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was in a mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Don't get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>It could be important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>This is important.  Right now, we are more important than what's going on at the hospital. So...I say we turn off our phones and... give the morning to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Okay. I'll go turn it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Thank you.  You're distracted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, you are. You turned off your phone but you're still wondering, "What could it have been? What emergency will bring down the entire hospital if I decide to take the morning off?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm sorry. The clinic is facing reduced funding from the state. Nurse Jeffrey is filing his 12th H.R. complaint. Richardson is threatening to quit because he's basically been a prisoner at the hospital for almost a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Richardson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>The neurosurgeon. He's the only one I have right now, which means he has to stay on the premises at all times, or else the hospital technically isn't a level one trauma center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Which means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'd have to shut down the E.R., transfer all of the patients out of the ICU...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Okay, stop. Turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Because you need to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I am going to make you a magical bath. It will have bubbles and eastern spices and blue diamonds and green clovers... transformative powers. But… I must have solitude to focus my creative energies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Interesting factoid. Did you know that if we don't have a neurosurgeon on the premises, all the puppies in the world will choke to death on all the babies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Yeah. You got a note from Thirteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So how come we don't have, like, five neurosurgeons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Well, we had three, but Kapur retired, and then Nichols just took off for his daughter's wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I've got good news. For the next 16 hours, you are the new neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content> I'm not a neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Which would matter if you actually had to do some neurosurgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>House, it's a hospital. The odds of having to do neurosurgery are higher than in most places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If an EMT calls in with a brain or spinal trauma, just divert them to the nearest hospital. All you gotta do is stand around and keep the E.R. open. It's an administrative problem, not a medical one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>House, where the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Great. Glad you're on it.  All systems go!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Why are you going to Rome? I found the flight information in your locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I love how everyone thinks it's so quaint and childlike of me to expect a modicum of privacy around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Your flight's tomorrow. What's so urgent in Rome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I hear they want to tear down the Coliseum to build a karaoke bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>The Buona Speranza Medical Center in Rome is doing a Huntington's trial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Seriously, I live to sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I know that they've been doing fetal neural transplantation. I also know that their subjects have increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This isn't the time to join a trial. This research is in its infancy. So's your condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content> You read my note. You go through my locker. And then you decide you want to round it off by lecturing me on my life choices?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I'm worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Oh. Well, that makes it all right then.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>So what, exactly, is this? It can still be open and casual and fun if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Open?  You think I want to see other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Well, last night was emotional for you.  We both lost that patient. We watched people die. I came back here and I went for the Vicodin, and you... dumped your fiancé and you came here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Which I don't regret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm not saying you do. I'm just saying it was an impulsive move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Don't do this. Why do you have to analyze things to death? Why can't you just... let it be nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content> You're right.  That was very anti-secret bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>The secret bath is... burning my lady parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>How do you think my  anus feels? Burning means it's working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Can we get out now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was so waiting for you to say that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Could I speak to Dr. Jankowski? No. I don't need to disturb him in Bermuda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps going directly to voicemail, and I need to get a neurosurgeon to replace Dr. Richardson for the day or else she's screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I'm a neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content> No. You're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I've cut into people's heads more often—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>You did a residency in neurosurgery at the University of Melbourne, but you were never board-certified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>You've worked here two days. How—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy's first assignment was for me to get to know everything about Dr. House's team... and not to believe anything any of them told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I'm... not a neurosurgeon?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And...voila! For the first course, I flaked some tender young ears of corn on the side of assorted exotic breakfast meats in a chili sauce reduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>And the... second course?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content> A single grape. To cleanse the palate. Which is kind of a waste, 'cause there is no third course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I'm glad we stayed in. This is actually... pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I can always tell when you lie. I mean always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I slept with my freshman roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>A lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>A truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You have a tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House </speaker><content>First admit that you were lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Fine. I was lying. My sexual history is boring and predictable. What is my tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Are you kidding? If I tell you your tell, you'll get rid of it, then I won't be able to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Well, then you have to tell me something I don't already know about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Even though, technically, you didn't tell me something that I didn't already know about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Quit being so damn logical and just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I used to have an intimate relationship with a photograph of you. Well, actually, a sock and a photograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>The photo you took of me as Sleeping Beauty on Halloween. Why else would you take that picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I have to pee.  Ha! You can't tell. 'Cause actually, I have to poo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Cuddy's assistant decided to use his own brain. Who put that idiot idea into his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Perhaps you could follow the same advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He notified DPH that there's no neurosurgeon on the premises. Said he legally had to, which he legally had to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Sounds like you got the situation under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>No. I don't. You know I don't. When DPH shows up, they're gonna shut down our E.R. This can't be fixed. It is what it is, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Great. I've got every faith in your ability to solve the problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I have called every neurosurgeon within a 45-mile radius — nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Maybe House is just testing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He's always testing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Test or not, it's a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's not our problem. Why the hell is it House's problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Where the hell is Cuddy? We either report this, and half the hospital gets shut down, or we cover it up and run the risk that the entire hospital gets shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Or we get Richardson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>He's sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>And we're doctors. We get people better. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>Fing Fong Fooey?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Can I open them yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Just a second.  Okay. Hold out your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content> I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne with one of these things. You might wanna stand behind me for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay...  Yeah!  Mm, I think I might have... got that slightly wrong. Well, good thing I got a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> House, open up. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content> Just let him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If we just ignore him, he'll go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> House!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content> I think he finally left. But just in case he hasn't, what can we do that does not involve talking?  You turned on my ringer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> I know you're in there. I can hear your cell phone ringing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Just let him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No! He's like a stray... he'll eat everything, shed all over the place, and crap on the floor.  Hi. This is Gregory House. I can't take your call at the moment. Please leave a message. If this is Wilson, I'm fine, not suicidal, not on drugs, coping very well with the loss of my last patient. So feel free to go about your day without worry. Beep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House. You can't just not show up to work. What's Cuddy gonna say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>If this is still Wilson... she gave me the day off. And tomorrow.  Okay, maybe not tomorrow. But today. I'm fine. Now, go away.  Beep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>If you're not in tomorrow, I'll be back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Look, you're the only neurosurgeon we've got. You have to suck it up and go back to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We're not asking you to operate, just to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Unless you can transport this t–toilet with me, I'm not leaving the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I'll get a bucket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>You're missing the point. I ate bad sushi. I'm sick. Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We can give you promethazine for the nausea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Already took it. And trimethobenzamide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content> Maybe this isn't food poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Whatever it is, it must have damaged the lining of his stomach. Till that heals, nothing's gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>So we need to treat both that and the nausea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And whatever's wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>We give him ondansetron and prostaglandins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>And whatever's wrong with him. Neither of those will treat any possible underlying condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Who cares? He's not our patient. The hospital is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>I can... hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content> You're pretty miserable, aren't you? Would you be willing to take a... fairly risky drug if it would make it all go away?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Why didn't you let him in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You were thinking about Wilson while we were having sex? That's so cool! So was I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>You were hiding me from him. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I was not hiding you. I was protecting your privacy. Wasn't sure if you were ready to go public with the whole... "us" thing yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Why would I be doing all this if I wanted it to be private? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Have you read the list of side effects on those drugs? We could crash his BP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I haven't heard a thump, so I assume he's still quietly puking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>We could be making him worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Bigger picture — we're making the hospital better. We can test for whatever you want to test him for once he's stable enough to get back to the hospital. Now, stop being a girl and move.  So you gonna ask me about this Huntington's trial, and by ask, I mean give me your opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>No. There is one thing, though. Will you have sex with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Well, this trial means you're leaving right away. I was playing a long game. Deadlines have been moved up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Wow. That stuff is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Think you can make it back to the hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Uh-huh. That lamp is shiny. I mean, the way it shines is... shiny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>I take it this is one of the side effects of the drugs.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You think I'm afraid to go public? I'm gonna prove you wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>With a sex tape. We'll send it to Wilson. It's a win-win. We get to do it again, and... he might actually learn something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content> It sounds like someone's trying to break in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Stuck? Bummer. Looks painful.  Chamomile or English breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Would you stop being an ass and pull me out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content> You didn't get my message earlier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Yeah. But as someone once told me, everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content> I'm fine. Just staying home, chill-laxin'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Your patient died, you ignore my calls, and you won't open the door. I don't think you're fine. I think you might be throwing away a drug-free year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Or... I'm ignoring you for a different reason.  Sex with my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Hmm.  Will you please just — please let me in?  Thank you. And since when did you start referring to hookers as girlfriends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>She's not a hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> What are — wha — really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Begins with "C", ends with “uddy.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content> How many Vicodin have you taken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm serious. Cuddy and I are now Cuddy and I. There's an "I" in Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House... it's okay. Almost all addicts relapse a few times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House </speaker><content> She's in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You're hallucinating, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Honey buns! We got company.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Pupils are normal. Pulse is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Better than that. They're both totally awesome. I'm not on drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>So... why did you lie about Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>To make a point. Probably something to do with shutting you up. It's my go-to idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>You do seem okay. You want me to stick around? I could do my usual thing of pretending I like watching monster truck rallies, if that would make you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No. You go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>House... you could have died. You had a patient who did die in your arms. You shouldn't be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I know. That's why I called a hooker.  Now, go away. 'Cause... you'll be extra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson </speaker><content>Are you really okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Are you gonna break in again? You checked my pulse. You checked my pupils. I'll mail you the urine sample.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that he can't perform brain surgery. What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>That's a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content> Thank God. DPH guy will be here in 20 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>What is wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>High blood sugar. You just said so.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>How long a leave are you taking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Depends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>On the drug trial. Sounds risky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Yadda, yadda. You don't think I should do it. Message heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>No. I approve. Living fast and dying young is crap. If you have a chance to get better... I say good for you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I brought Wilson in here specifically to go public, just like you requested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I pressured you. Wilson coming through the window pressured you. If you're forced into this, it's not gonna work.  Do you have any response to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Game on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>Then we're screwed. Don't we have to tell—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Oh! Damn.  Dr. Richardson's prepping for surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Malkin </speaker><content>Yeah. I need to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He's prepping for surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Malkin </speaker><content>So you said. I just need to confirm he is who you say he is and that he's a licensed neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Well, here's his paperwork.  His hospital I.D.'s right there. You can... see it's him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Malkin </speaker><content>Yeah. I should still talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>They've already scrubbed. He'd have to be re-sterilized. The patient's anesthesia would have to be adjusted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Malkin </speaker><content> Why did you report he wasn't here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Alex </speaker><content>I must have... misunderstood.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Malkin </speaker><content>Oh, I'm sure you have an explanation, but I don't care. See, you need to have a doctor on the premises who can actually do neurosurgery. Tell the attending to divert all ambulances away and start calling other hospitals and see who can take your stabilized ICU patients. Those departments are shutting down.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Why didn't you tell me you loved me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Didn't a wise woman once say — and by once, I mean two hours ago — "why do you have to analyze everything to death? Why can't this just be nice?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content> I told you I loved you. You didn't tell me you loved me back. You don't think that should give me cause for concern?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You do know we still have a sick patient here. Right? He's the guy sitting right behind you, taking off his clothes again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content> Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, why don't you just sit down and take it easy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>He should be coming down by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>And yet... I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>What if his behavior isn't a side effect of the ondansetron? What if it's a symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Thank you. What causes delirium and nausea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Taub </speaker><content>He's been stuck here in the hospital a few days. Nobody else is sick, so it can't be environmental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content> Not exactly stuck. I snuck out.  Freedom is my birthright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Where did you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>The Seafood Festival at the Convention Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>We're screwed. Seafood Festival has stuff from all around the world in combinations nobody ever thought of. We could be here all year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content> You had shrimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content> Did you eat any roe? Little tiny eggs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>Nummy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Toad eggs will cause nausea, and they can get you high. If I'm right, the antidote is fast-acting.  If we can get him to keep his clothes on long enough, he can pass as a functioning neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Nope. But I got a pretty good idea what it looks like. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>H–how did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You used to have a picture of it as a screensaver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>That was years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I guess it's a memorable place.  Now, unfortunately, we can't fly straight to Normandy, but the layover in London's only a couple of hours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's all there.  All you gotta do is click confirm, and we're eating croissant and being insulted by stinky people this time tomorrow. Don't worry. I used Wilson's credit card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm kidding. I used your credit card.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>This is crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>House </speaker><content> So...you break off your engagement, but you won't adjust your schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>I can't. Not... tomorrow. But... two weekends from now. If Rachel's gonna stay with my mom, I'm gonna need a little bit of prep time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>House </speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Richardson </speaker><content>My old self was boring. Can't we keep the new self?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Just lay down, and stop unbuttoning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Do you have anyone going with you to Rome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>Is that your passive-aggressive way of asking me if I'm seeing somebody else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I hope you are. I mean... I hope you have someone with you. If I'm scared about this, I can't imagine how you must feel. You shouldn't be alone. If you want... I could fly over for a few days. Friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Thirteen </speaker><content>I appreciate that, but I think I'll be okay. I guess we took the long way around to being friends, huh?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Cuddy </speaker><content>Right. Because you can see the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No. But I can see the past. And you're gonna remember all the horrible things I've done, and you're gonna try to convince yourself that I've changed. And I'm gonna start doing those horrible things again, because I haven't changed. Then you'll realize that... I'm an insane choice for someone who has a kid. And from there, it's a short step to the inevitable conclusion that all of this... was a mistake. Tell me any of that isn't true.</content></utterance>

However, on the other hand, I'd be remiss if I... didn't follow up and confirm. See? It's the same look. So if it didn't mean no the first time, then...</content></utterance>
