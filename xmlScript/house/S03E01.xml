<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The guy drove his wheelchair into a pool, House would love that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He'll be bored. It's a great visual but it's diagnostically boring. What about post-hair transplant aphasia guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Infection throwing clots, House will shoot it down and call you an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, well we wouldn't want that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What about yoga girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Has a good hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Should we lead with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>His first day back, might want to flex his sarcasm muscle; maybe we open with one of the weaker pitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You ran here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's just... 8 miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why did you...? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why does a dog lick its –  workplace acceptable euphemism for testicles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because he can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What have you got for me boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I thought you said you needed 8 weeks of rehab. You should have been back here—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If I'd come back sooner, I'd only be able to run 6 miles. I never would have made it in. What have you got for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're completely pain free? The ketamine treatment can wear off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It can take as long as--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are we having this discussion? Want to hear me thank you again? Thank you Dr Cuddy. Not just for removing the bullet, but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life. Happy? I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Middle-aged man: had hair transplant about 2 months ago--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Infection throwing clots, you're an idiot.  Except you're not an idiot,  and she's holding a file for a 26-yr-old female, what have you really got for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Girl was doing an inverted yoga pose, neck snapped, paralyzed from the neck down except the x-rays show no evidence of spinal injury. And she's cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, well played sir!  What about Stephen Hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Forget it - brain cancer, brain surgery - there's nothing left to diagnose. I would take the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmm... I'll take them both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't think he had brain cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course he had brain cancer; even oncologists don't screw up for 8 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So if there's no diagnostic issue why are you taking the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treatment can be interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you haven't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I haven't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then why are you taking the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guy tried to kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The guy had cancer, he's a lump; he hasn't been able to touch his wife, speak to his kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's been in that chair for 8 years, his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain. Isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No you haven't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then why am I taking this case? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's start with the cute paraplegic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Welcome back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You look...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Quad with no broken neck, struck me as odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uhh... you could take a whole 2 minutes to ease into being back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck. So, go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We heard they never found the guy. There's no new leads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? You think he might have shot this patient too? Would explain her symptoms…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? It's not so difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be transverse myelitis, swelling in the disk choking off nerve function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>MRI's negative for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The leg looks fine. You totally pain free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's a little weird to discuss the case while you're staring at your blood on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I asked Cuddy to replace the carpet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Re-do the tests.  Let's see if the source of the problem is in the limbs or the spine. Do an EMG.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Got a whole other quad to cover; this guy's still got fluid in his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-65"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don't think that's from the pool he drank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-66"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-67"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Comfortable? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-68"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Scoot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Thanks for being here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>My dad wouldn't kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You haven't spoken to him in over 6 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I know my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Mark, the doctor's just trying to--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>He wouldn't kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. I'm wrong. You obviously have a better understanding of this man who drools in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Dr. House...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Look, he must have been confused. It must have been an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hope it was a suicide attempt. If he was trying to kill himself then he knows how miserable his life is, means there's still something there to kill; means your dad's still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sorry, need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content> Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We were doing the EMG but we never got past the insertion of the conduction pin. Did she just say thank you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I loaned her some money. What went wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Nothing went wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nothing went wrong then something went right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're not going to tell me why she thanked you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're not going to tell me what went right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You did something for which she is grateful and you're... embarrassed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For you. Saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-yr-old boy, I set her straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm not telling you what went wrong - or right, until you tell me why she said thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ohhh, you got me. You know I need to know, I'm so going to fold. Except you're forgetting, there's one thing I can do now. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's either that or a reflex response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ok, this is Dr. House. House, this is Caren--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pleasure's all mine, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She flinched! Did you hear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>Does that mean I'm getting better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How big is a flinch? Bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm?  You smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>Socially, a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You do yoga and you smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>I know it's hypocritical but--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How would smoking cause--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It wouldn't, just needed a lighter. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>My god!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The case was looking so promising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>Hey, I'm not faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You moved, therefore you can move. Get this lunatic out of here before she bores again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>I'm not faking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I heard you were watching surgery with a patient's family. Talking to a patient's family. It’s because of your hallucination, isn't it? After you were shot? You chose life; you decided you wanted meaning, so you took a case with no mystery. Something any doctor could do. A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helping another human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She thanked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And... you felt nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wasn't even sure what I was supposed to feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's like your leg, its atrophied. Keep working it, the feeling will come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sorry, need you, again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told you to get rid of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's a good thing we didn't. Tightness in her chest, she can't breathe, it could be pleural effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. I'm not going to burn you again. I'm going to STAB YOU!  Look, either you're faking, or you've got a pleural effusion - that's a build-up of fluid around the lungs which is very serious - and I would have no choice but to stab you in the back with this needle and suck all the fluid out of you.  So--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We should give her a local.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would defeat the point of me being nasty.  Ready?  Down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But she can't breathe if she's down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She can't breathe--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Down! Down, down, down! Come on! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's not a pleural effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Problem's in her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't fake that.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Had to relieve the pressure 3 times in the last 2 hours. So either we figure out what's causing blood to build up around her heart or I follow her around with the needle for the rest of her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Echo was clean, no structural abnormalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be an infectious process. TB?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or vasculitis would also explain the effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But not the paralysis. Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She moved, therefore she could move. She wasn't paralyzed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ehh... doesn't mean she was faking, could have been a delusion. Now, either she was faking, and coincidentally got a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion and the fake paralysis is a real neurological symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're thinking vascular tumor on her spine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her platelets are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And she's been scanned up and down, it's all clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, open her up, and find it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what do you want us to do? Start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That should work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His heart rate's a little high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Should I be worried?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably just means he's still in discomfort from the surgery. I'm going to up his morphine a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>You've been so nice to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>No, I mean all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the... the cancer, the treatment, the damage... just trying to fix him. You're the first doctor that's ever given a damn about the quality of his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What a touching moment. That's why we become doctors. For those rare moments when our hearts are warm--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you like to get a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I'm serious. I drink, you drink. We could do it at the same time, same table. Do you eat? We could do that too. I mean, if the answer's no that's cool but... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, I... it's just... you're just coming off the surgery and you're not yourself yet and I work for you and even though last year's...  you're smiling! I'm saying no and you're smiling!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, don't take it personally. Its just coz you're full of crap. You have no interest in going out with me. Maybe you did, when I couldn't walk and I was a sick puppy that you could nurture back to health. Now that I'm healthy, there's nothing in it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You are not healthy.  Cuddy wants to see you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You've been back at work 24 hours and you're already playing hide and seek in a woman's spine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who won the pool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There's no tumor. Her platelets are normal, scans--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't even notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Her lawyers might. You're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What? You want a trade? We're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There already is a mechanism for that. It's called the employer-employee relationship. I get what I want, and you don't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You tried to swap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ran a few more tests, came back negative, surgery's on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You really don't give a crap, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does that make me evil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The girl's life is at stake, what we're talking about with the guy--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What we're talking about is the reason you took the case; to help someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too bad for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Too bad for you. The reason we crave meaning is because it makes us happy. The first level of happiness is--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not going away. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The fifth level of happiness involves creation. Changing lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sixth level is heroin; seventh level is you going away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're saving lives, which is tantamount to creating lives but all you're taking away from this, is the game. You don't have to listen to them thanking you, you don't have to change the cases you take or even how you handle them. You just have to know that you made a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>House, you're not--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not an idiot.  Move.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>The room's no longer sterile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True, it's not the most interesting reason.  That is not a sexy big toe. You'd never put that in your mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>What the hell has that got to do with--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Caren</speaker><content>Like what sailors get when they don't eat right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Aye, aye. Your arms and leg tissues are choked with blood. Makes it hard to move. Also damages your hair and toenails.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>So he won't have any pain?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Yeah. I could dump him there, except he's my husband. He's my son's father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. Kids need a dad; someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I have a responsibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down, sapping your energy, wasting your life - that's the meaning you take from this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I want to take care of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You enjoy this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I can't abandon him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you don't want to take care of him. Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy. But not taking care of him would make you miserable.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That... was talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You guys are lousy doctors. You're in such a rush to make the patient feel better you forgot to check what was wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guhhhhhhh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course not, because then she would never have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The Vicodin dulled it, in the sober light of day I'm a buzz kill. You're giving false hope to a family that’s been wrecked. Don't torture them, let it go, tell the wife it was only a grunt, tell her to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope.  Oh! I stuck that primo! How rad am I? </content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>2002, patient had dry eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dry eyes plus a grunt, it all makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He had neurological issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I get hay fever, I put drops in my eyes, I don't go to a neurologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Dry eyes could indicate an autonomic dysfunction; goes on the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about coughing or boogers. Should we include boogers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm happy we're doing this, I'd much rather do this than lengthen some guy's tendon. Patient's headaches increased. Doc scanned his head, found a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You like wasting your time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm learning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>To do what? Reconsider solved cases because you don't want to deal with the real world? He's pushing when there's nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron, you are an excellent doctor, you'll get lots of tearful thank yous from grateful patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, am I such a bitch for wanting that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, it's not a bad thing, but it's not why I'm here. I took this fellowship to learn from House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's teaching you to be a masochist. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dry eyes, goes on the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In 8 years the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any patterns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or a urinary tract infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>White count was normal, no infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you add pain into the mix, fever, frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, creatinine and BUN were both normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Perfect, you managed to pick the one symptom he never had. Abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Richard's symptoms are culled from 8 years of medical history. They're not patterned. These are random individual events over time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His throat will collapse, muscle degeneration in his neck won't tolerate the scope, it's an automatic trach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're talking about him like he's an invalid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, we're insensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight? Does he choke on his food? His neck's fine, his throat's not going to collapse. Cameron, get consent from the wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Open.  I need you to swallow.  Sorry about that. Here we go.  Passing through the lower esophageal sphincter into the atrium of the stomach.  There's the tail of the pancreas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Looks clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Moving medially, the body and the head of the pancreas look clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Get it out, get it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's stuck, I can't move it. His throat’s collapsed. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Vitals all over the place. We're losing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cutting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We trached him, endoscopically removed the probe and he's breathing again. So, all in all, great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which means barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This man nearly died. How can you discharge him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>His throat collapsed because of what we predicted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You stick something down someone's throat, they gag, spasm, which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except that our patient's throat was sedated. Which means the brain should have sent a signal not to do anything. This could be cancer, or some bizarre neuro-degeneration, even a new type of vasculitis--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Stop it.  You're enjoying this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I find it interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's interesting only if you're right; if you're wrong we're torturing this guy to amuse you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Half hour to remove the probe? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not a spasm. His throat didn't collapse, it locked down. Brain is supposed to tell every muscle in the body to relax and contract at the same time, this muscle was only contracting which means a signal from the brain was not getting through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There are no lesions on his brain, nothing to interrupt the new orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All it takes is one wire down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have no evidence of any wires down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You want to look at the lining of his brain? The amount of contrast material you need to pump up there just to see it--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He will bleed into his brain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, he won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because that wouldn't be interesting. You can get permission this time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Does this mean that the cancer's back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, no, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>So what, more surgery? More radiation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might even get some brain function back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>He could get better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But understanding what you're saying would be nice. Maybe you can figure out ways to communicate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Thank God he spoke to you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mrs. McNeil, the test to do this is very risky. He could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>He's already dead. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.  He's been sick and suffering for 8 years, I'm not going to help you make it worse; I'm not going to help you make it interesting.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're 40 something years old, you've been running God knows how many miles a day, fallen a hundred times off that skateboard and you're shocked to have some soreness?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Circumventricular system sends his cytokines, releasing the early stages of the immune response but CDOS releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by antipyretic therapy.  So yeah, his brain's on fire. The suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt; he drove that wheelchair into the pool because he couldn't regulate his body temperature. He had hypothalamic dysregulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fountain. I can cure him.</content></utterance>
