<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>But only if he can defeat the Captain of my guard, Sir Horace the Black!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Sir William... Wouldst thou fight for my honor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content> To the death, your majesty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Let's hope it does not come to that, eh?  I choose Sir William as my champion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content> Attack from his left side. I saw his squire bandaging that shoulder this morning.  I wish thee luck and strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>William</speaker><content>I fear I shall need all I can get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content> The Captain of my guard, Sir Horace the Black!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>Are you sure you wouldn't like to reconsider your choice, my queen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>I believe I chose rightly, my king.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sir Horace</speaker><content> Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>Brave knights, in the honored tradition of our lands, have at ye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>I fear you chose most poorly, my love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chanting Crowd</speaker><content>William! William! William! William!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chanting Crowd</speaker><content>William! William! William! William!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>William? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Your eyes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>You're naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And, for the record, a little bit cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> I'm sorry, I didn't know that anyone was home. James had an early call, and I was just leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Without breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> I'm fine, thanks. I'm Sam, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> House. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> It'd be nicer if you'd put this on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So you and Wilson...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Thought you were staying in New York last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, must have missed the "if this trailer be a-rockin'" sign out front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> I'm really late, so — if there's any chance that we can pretend this never happened, I'd be completely fine with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> An eight-year-old with bleeding ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I'll see your bleeding ears and raise you a total muscular degeneration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I had a dream like this once. It didn't end well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Huzzah, my loyal peasants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl at the Goldstein bris.  While I'm busy, you all can check out the Knight down in the E.R., who, instead of seizing the throne, just seized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> He works at a Renaissance Festival?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doesn't work there, he lives there as part of a wonderful little troupe, who spend their weekends reenacting a nobler age, when people crapped in the streets, and Thirteen would have been a grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Weeks, not weekends. Says here he's been camping out for a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try doing that with a pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Why don't you put that down before you kill one of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Better idea, why don't you give me something I can use so I won't feel the need to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Seizure right after a fight obviously suggests concussion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Obviously it isn't, or the E.R. wouldn't have called House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A full set of armor would protect against visible trauma, but not transmitted concussive force. Could be a subdural hematoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're forgetting to demonize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Two demon eyes. Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be an allergic reaction to something from the Renaissance Fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is why we need to check out Middle-earth. Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I still think a hematoma is more likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But you just—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said Frodo, not Gollum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is he saying I have short legs or hairy feet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't even know who Frodo is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's the chick, and why are you hiding her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You were home last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And this morning. I bumped into your babe, naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I told you to stay out of my bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She was naked in the kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why the hell were you naked in the kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, it's not important right now. What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place. Is she married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't have time for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She used to be a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wants to be a man. Sam — it's a man's name, short for...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Samantha. The soulless harpy you were married to before we met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> People change, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sure. They get older, ovaries start drying up, and nice guys like you look attractive again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Listen, I know that, in your own demented way, you think you're looking out for me. But I have this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach. Fine. I get it. It's your life.  You go screw it up. I can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To tell you, "I told you so."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No signs of hematoma. Brain looks completely normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Normal, except for the fact that he likes to play dress-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>My Uncle used to pretend he was King Leopold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content> I'm not pretending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Um, sorry about that. You don't really think you're a Knight, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content> Being a Knight isn't a game. It's a lifestyle, and we do it every day, not just when we play dress-up. We live by a code and uphold ideals, like loyalty, courage, humility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And the part where you beat the crap out of each other in armor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>William</speaker><content> That we do for fun. At least it was up until yesterday. Are — are we almost done? 'Cause I'm feeling—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Let's get him out of there before he aspirates.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Anything abnormal on the MRI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Man at Faire</speaker><content>God's teeth, what strange manner of garments be these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Okay, we'll be back soon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Man at Faire</speaker><content>He consorts with tiny demons in his hand. 'Tis witchcraft, I say!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Do I look like I'm here to play pretend with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Relax, it's not personal. Just tell them you're a time traveler or something. Well, if we're gonna be here, we might as well enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Our Knight just vomited inside the MRI. Taub thinks it might be food poisoning...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which shouldn't be surprising — outdoor latrines, food prep going on next to livestock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>I hear you wish to speak with me, concerning Sir William. How faireth he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not well, or we wouldn't be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>A pox indeed is—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content> Miles. We just thought it was a concussion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content> He's gonna be okay, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We need to look at the area he was camping out in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And you might want to invest into a dental plan for the kingdom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>You sure he got sick from something here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not sure of anything yet, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What do you make of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Hmm... looks like vomit. Means he was showing symptoms prior to the fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> True, but I meant this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>Oh, it's a cow eye. From the night before the tournament.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>He makes the Knights eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>He got the idea from Fear Factor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why didn't he mention it when he checked into the hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>I make them all take an oath of secrecy about the ritual. William tends to take his role as a Knight very seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Do you think that's what caused him to pass out?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's not exactly sanitary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fun stuff never is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Serious bacterial food poisoning explains seizure and vomiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A lumbar puncture could confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except it's not food poisoning. If it was, the E.R. would look like Camelot right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All it takes is one bad eyeball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or testicle, cow brain, or my personal favorite, pig rectum, with a side order of sphincter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think they call that breakfast in Australia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's what I sent you to Middle-earth to find out.  Run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's gonna take time, and he's getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So treat him with epinephrine too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This should prevent any more symptoms until we can figure out what it is you're allergic to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Told you you shouldn't have eaten all that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content> You know, you don't have to stay. I'm sure you and Miles are crazy busy, what with the wedding and all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Miles said we could postpone it until—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Don't worry. I'll be fine. I'll be there. I just hope you have a good photographer, 'cause I don't think the standard red-eye filter is gonna work on these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I need your right arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>William</speaker><content>That, uh... feels — feels strange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>What is it? What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His heart rate's become irregular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>William</speaker><content>My — my chest hurts. It feels like it's gonna explode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tachycardia — we need to shock him back into rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Oh, my God, William.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I need his gown open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>William</speaker><content>What is — what is that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's definitely not an allergy, or the epi would have helped him, not made him worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure. Sodium bisulfite — the preservative that keeps epi peppy — can cause tachycardia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So can Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and it also causes hemorrhaging in the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And abnormal electrical pathways in the heart, which could cause seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But not skin infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There is an infection that can cause skin and neurological damage and spreads rapidly without treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lord have MRSA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You weren't wearing gloves when we shocked his heart back into rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure you'll be fine.  You two get a sample to the lab to confirm,  you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. antibiotics.  You... stay away from me. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>About the MRSA? I know, we're—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> MRSA, shmrsa. Something important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Something you think is more important than the potentially lethal bacteria spreading like wildfire through my hospital? Well, that narrows it down to something personal and stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Theory confirmed. He is dating his first wife. I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That he didn't ask your permission first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you'd be surprised how many things Wilson doesn't tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Would I? Like — like how you slept with your father's best friend or...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm gonna kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You need to break them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time? You remember what he was like after that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, then do something.  God knows he's not gonna listen to me. You, on the other hand, have decades of experience dating and being attracted to losers. Obviously, I don't include myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You know what happens when you interfere in other people's relationships?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course. I do it all the time. Hmm, I see your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That is why I'm staying out of this. You force him to choose, you might not like the answer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>He doesn't seem to be in as much pain anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That's good, but we won't be out of the woods for sure until the blisters start to recede.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>William</speaker><content> Hey, I'm really thirsty. You mind getting me a soda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Sure, I'll be right back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content>The pain in my chest, it's getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Just now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>William</speaker><content>No, I didn't want to worry her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So how long have you been in love with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>William</speaker><content>What? No, we're just friends. Seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Since the first time I saw her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why don't you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>William</speaker><content>She's engaged to my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The King? Haven't seen him visiting or sitting by your bedside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>William</speaker><content>He has responsibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah. I'm guessing the Queen does too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>William</speaker><content>What kind of Knight steals his friend's bride? I hate that I even think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're not a Knight. You're just a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>William</speaker><content>But I want to be more than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>William</speaker><content>No, my — my back. Feels like there's a knife in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Is the infection spreading?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> It's not MRSA. It looks like some sort of clostridial organism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Question is, which type of clostridium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There's hundreds. C. Perfringens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wouldn't account for his other symptoms. C. Tetani, on the other hand...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Tetanus, he — he would have been inoculated against it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So he cut himself and didn't get a booster shot. The guy fights people with swords for fun. No one said he's smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They don't just fight for fun. They fight to prove their bravery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're buying this honor stuff? Fighting's not brave. It's just stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You would say that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know, it's poison Ivy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Poison Ivy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A severe reaction could cause the blisters and maybe irritate his eyes enough to cause the hemorrhaging, but the chest pain and seizures...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They have bonfires every night. The burning leaves aerosolizes the oil. We've seen what it's done to the outside of his body. Imagine what it's doing to his lungs and his sinuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay, maybe it remotely fits, but I'd rather go with scientific evidence than with your gut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How about this? Apparently, it's all over his sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's his heart rate again.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That wasn't caused by poison Ivy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or epinephrine. That means the heart problem we ruled out, we now have to rule back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We found clostridium bacteria in the skin samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Clostridium's in dirt and basically harmless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But opportunistic, if his immune system is depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Leukemia?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system, which means it has to be some other environmental toxin. Yesterday he was a healthy Knight, today he's Sleeping Beauty. Nothing else fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Trichinosis from eating infected meat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We already ruled out food poisoning. Both the butcher shop and the food stands at the fair were totally clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then he ate the poison apple somewhere else. Or maybe you just missed it. Start treatment for trichinosis and confirm with a muscle biopsy. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, she didn't dump me. She wants to get to know you better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn it. I never should have let her see me naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It goes against all my instincts, but I said all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She thinks I was hiding her from you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't want her to know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, listen. I know you're worried about me, and I also know that that kind of unselfishness doesn't come naturally to you. But I don't want your help. I don't need your help. Just come to dinner and be your usual selfish self.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content> No, don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I think he's saying it's different with you, Shannon. It's a guy thing — they don't like showing weakness in front of each other. Right William?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Right. Maybe when I'm feeling a little better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I'm gonna take a small sample of your muscle tissue here.  Do you mind waiting outside for this?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Knights are supposed to be selfless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Right, they conquered countries and built Castles by being selfless. Bravery and loyalty are great qualities, for soldiers. If you want to be King, sometimes you have to be willing to take what's yours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His muscle biopsy is clean. It's not trichinosis. House was wrong, this is not environmental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or we screwed up and missed something at the Renaissance Faire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You think we did?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And that's relevant how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Extra pain means extra cranky, it means off his game. He's not gonna accept this isn't environmental unless we give him no choice.</content></utterance>

But, either way... Am I out of my mind?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Try rose hips. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Both harmless, who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It could be cyanide as far as he knows.  How about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Shop Clerk</speaker><content>It be nothing but St. John's Wort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wrong again. Black cohash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Shop Clerk</speaker><content>My Uncle owns the shop. I just started apprenticing. What the big deal?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's hemlock, you embossed carbuncle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Shop Clerk</speaker><content>That's hemlock? You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you sell it to anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's poison; think hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>Shop Clerk</speaker><content>It was just one branch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sold it to Sir William?</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>What's going on? Why can't we see William?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you poisoned him. Your royal anus.  With this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>Wild carrots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hemlock. I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>You did something to William?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>No, of course not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's still alive. You want to avoid a murder charge, start talking fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, maybe I bought it for the food challenge, but I didn't know that was hemlock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it was for the challenge, then why is wee Willie the only Knight who's dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't know. Why would I want to hurt William?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I can think of at least one reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Shannon</speaker><content>Miles, please. Whatever happened, just tell them the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Miles</speaker><content>I am! I swear.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We ran a gas chromatography on his blood. Found trace amounts of piperidine alkaloids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The main markers of hemlock intoxication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, the good news is we now know what's wrong with you. The bad news is that your King's precious ideals were just pretend after all. At least, when it comes to guys who get too close to his Queen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content>It's not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I guess you've never heard the expression, "gas chromatography machines don't lie."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Neither does Miles. He's the best Knight I've ever known. It's why he was chosen King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Miles is a jealous idiot. And you're just an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, something's wrong. We performed a gastric lavage and administered activated charcoal, but he's getting worse, not better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, it's been in his system two days. We're lucky he's lasted this long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If it was hemlock, he'd either be dead already or getting better with treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's hemlock, we found it in his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He may have had some hemlock, but it's not what's killing him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Don't do it!  Whatever you're planning, especially if you're gonna use that thing. Geez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was just sitting in a stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> Here. It's gonna cost extra, because of the level of detail that you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anything good? And by good, I, of course, mean bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> Nope, pretty much your typical life. Married young, got divorced. Married a little less young, got divorced. She's been pretty successful in everything she's done, except marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, there's gotta be something I can use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Maybe. Didn't read her shrink's notes. Didn't seem right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But stealing them did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Whoa, I didn't steal them. I found a way to obtain them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Sure.  Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Careful. I have a sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> I don't agree with what you said. But I understand why you said it. We were married young, we both made mistakes, and yes, I did make most of them. But that was almost a decade ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I'm not asking you to like me, House. To be honest, I think you're an ass. But we do have one thing in common. We care about James.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So prove it. And dump him... again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>You're pretty much insufferable all the time, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, go on. And, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>We just reconnected; we have no idea where we're headed. But is it really too much to ask that you give us a chance to find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We did it. Well, I did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What exactly did we do? You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>These aren't focal hepatic lesions on his liver, they're peliosis hepatis lesions. Which in combination with an erratic heart rate, usually indicates—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Endocarditis. Infection on his heart valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Two major symptoms of anabolic steroid abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, he wouldn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And the rhabdo makes the third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Our patient's a juicer. Ancient poison accelerated the damage of the modern poison. Start treatment; let the King out of the tower.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Ashamed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You should be. You'll compromise your ideals to win a fight, but not to go for the woman you love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>William</speaker><content>That was a game. Not real life. I didn't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hurt anyone? Try telling that to Shannon. Or maybe I missed something while she was crying by your bed. You don't need to win anyone's heart. You just need to ask for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>William</speaker><content>Miles, is a great guy. He's rich, smart, treats her well. She's gonna have a great life with him. But me? Well, I'd do everything I could for her, but even at my best, it wouldn't be much. And she deserves the best. I guess I'd rather she be happy even if it means I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I guess House was right about that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>William</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You really are an idiot.</content></utterance>
