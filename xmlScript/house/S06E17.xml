<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The bracelet on your baby's ankle has a microchip that would set off alarms if she was carried through an exit.  Call the police. Shut down all the exits. We are on lockdown. Nobody moves until we find that baby.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Truth or dare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, no, you don't want to mess with me. True or dare queen at Newton North.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was kidding. I'm sure we can find something interesting to talk about without relying on some juvenile game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Truth.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Smits</speaker><content>They think I took the kid? Do you think I would do something —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, I'm just asking questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Smits</speaker><content>The dad let the older brother hold the baby for the first time. So I put her in his lap. After a few seconds, she shrieked. I'm pretty sure he pinched her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need to know this stuff. Anything out of the ordinary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Smits</speaker><content>It was sibling rivalry. I thought it was kind of ordinary.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What are you doing down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I was looking for McKenna's patient file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh, you mean this file?  The one I said I'd get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Two hours ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Seriously, you don't trust me with the immense responsibility of fetching a file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you already found it, what are you looking through those for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you know what these are? The staff credentials files.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Those should all be in H.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Down here to be digitized. And we're locked in, and whoever's supposed to be watching 'em is locked out. We could look up anything on anyone. Malpractice records, felony histories —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Put them away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Come on. We have a tiny window of opportunity to gain some insight into our colleagues.  Okay. What if we just snoop on the boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think I can live with that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're on two milligrams of morphine an hour. How the hell are you still awake? No, don't tell me.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the blood's not reaching your gut, you have intestinal hypoperfusion. That'd be stronger than the narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was being kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>You're Dr. House, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>The limp. Yeah, I read about you. I sent you a letter before they knew what was wrong. Tried to get you to take my case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you should have kept reading. Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>It started as tooth pain. No one got it that it was a heart problem. Till I had a series of massive heart attack —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>This doesn't bother you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You talking with your mouth full? A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>I meant the fact that you're standing here watching me die because of my – my file bored you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I take maybe 1 in 20 cases. A lot of the people I turn down end up dying. It's really a good argument for there being more than one me when you think about it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>All right. Have you ever had a threesome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You haven't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Wait, just – just because I'm bisexual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Do you understand what bisexual means? It doesn't mean you have sex with two people at once.  And by the way, you didn't ask me if I'd had a foursome. Truth or dare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wait. You've had a foursome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, but now you've asked me two questions, so I get to ask you two. You see why I was the queen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Oh!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content> Walker's been getting in fights a lot at school lately. Last week, he hit another kid with a book hard enough to draw blood. If he did something to the baby...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And we failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No, you had a conversation with House, then came back, informed me I'd been forever poisoned by him, and started packing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's interesting how your story leaves out the part where you murdered another human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A dictator who was committing genocide. You thought about doing it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. Because you're not toxic like I am. </content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> There must be over 30 malpractice settlements in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> He did a brain biopsy without CT mapping, causing brain herniation and death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Look at this one. Patient lost four liters of blood from a botched penisectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> On a patient named Lisa Cuddy?  Damn it. They're all named Lisa Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's not even here, and he's screwing with us.  Where's the joy in that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You really want to get into his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, but I decided against stabbing myself in the leg or getting addicted to pain pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> You can, uh... skip the stabbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Where did you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Confiscated them from a drug seeker in that clinic. Didn't get a chance to turn 'em in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It is after hours. I'll take one.  Walk in House's shoes for a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One? I believe he wears a larger size.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No cards, no flowers, not even a phone call. Let me guess. Lighthouse keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>I was a classics professor at Princeton for 26 years. Mostly research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago. That must be it. Not that you have no friends because, say, you're a miserable bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>What do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The next few hours are gonna be grim. There'll be nausea, pain, no company, as soon as I can get myself out of here. I can unlock the regulator. You can put yourself in a narcotic haze, sleep blissfully to the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>Oh, is that a favor to me or to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Win-win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content> No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>You think a classicist doesn't believe in fate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think Odysseus would lie whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed?  Come on, take my offer. Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>I think you're the one who wants to numb himself out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How did your dad react when you came out to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He made me tea. Seriously. Doesn't matter what I tell him. He smiles, tells me he supports me, and makes me some peppermint tea. Truth or dare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Um, truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Are you dating anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Now? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Interesting. You added a modifier. Truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Um, when you were dating Foreman...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, no. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If it was something personal about him or us, I just don't think that's right to answer. We all work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That's the whole point of this game — something personal, preferably embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Just pick something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You see, this is your problem. You act like you're so liberal and open, but you are the least —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I changed my mind. Dare. Just no nudity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, nudity. I want you to show… your breasts… to Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That is the most idiotic dare ever. Have you ever played this game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, I thought showing me your breasts would be a little exploitative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your dare is in the future, genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hey, if you're saying you won't do it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. Of course I'll show my breasts to Taub. Tomorrow, perhaps, or maybe some time next year, you know, because I'm honor-bound. Truth or dare?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's understandable that you wouldn't be happy right now. Your world is changing. You scared?  And how do you feel about your sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Walker</speaker><content>I hate her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Walker, this is important. Did you do anything to the baby? Did you move her somewhere? Hide her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Walker</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Nobody'd be mad at you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bad pain month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>Since I'm not using it...  Oh, if you don't want the morphine, you must have something of your own, Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was in rehab. I had a little problem with the something of my own. Now all I take is ibuprofen, and it's two flights up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>For the whole month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The pain's migrated. I think the arterial wall is damaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>What, you don't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I haven't had an arteriogram yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>And you don't want the test. In case the arterial wall is fine. Which would mean that the pain is coming from something else.  What's her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting... That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love. You're projecting. So what's her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>What time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does it matter to you? It's "t" minus four hours.  8:20. Now tell me who she is and what are the pathetically long odds that she's gonna visit or call. And why that's a reason not to take the morphine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hit me in the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know you've always wanted to. Now's your chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's a great idea. We start a fight club. Maybe we...  Oh, my God! You — that is so cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I can still feel my hand.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's why you came down here. Not for the patient file. You wanted...  You wanted...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> How can you even ask that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The first time you slept with me was because you were on crystal meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was on the drugs because I was emotional. It was the emotions that led to the sex, not the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not true. After that, you refused to let it go further than just sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because I knew I was falling for you and I didn't want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And that never changed. You broke off our vacation because I bought you a ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I got cold feet. I'm not proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And then you almost called off our wedding because —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Don’t</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Don't bring him up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because even then, you weren't sure about me. Maybe if I was dying when you married me, it would have been a bit different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That's not fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not only fair, it's exactly the point. He was dying when you met him, and he was gone just a year into the marriage. So it was all a honeymoon with him. And I could never match up to that. The first time reality intruded —</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You said you weren't dating anyone now. Does that you mean you recently were, or soon will be?  Oh. Look who's guarded now. You had no problem talking about your sex life, but your love life... Fine. Dare it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No nudity now or in the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're too much of a nice boy, Wilson. Let's let the bad boy out for a bit. You have to go steal one dollar right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>From who?  Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Uh, interned at Hopkins. Old news.  Here we go. Academic probation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I am asking you to please stop reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm afraid I can't do that. Faked a lab result.  Very wrong! And you came down to destroy the record before it gets digitized. Permanentized. Even wronger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I... I needed to beat all those elite, spoiled kids around me, to show no weaknesses, to win at everything. Why'd I just tell you that? I always talk too much when I'm stoned. Why'd I just tell you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was stupid. You had great grades. One lab result shouldn't have mattered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Except I didn't think I deserved to be at a top med school in the first place.  Again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Faking lab results is one thing. But you needing to come down here to destroy the records 12 years after the fact... This isn't about med school. You don't think you belong here. At the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Dr. Taub, comma, Christopher Michael.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So this is what it comes down to in the final hours. Deifying some lost love. Hoping to get her on the phone and make everything perfect. It's pathetic. Either you left her for a reason or she left you for a reason.  A phone call is not —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>It's my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So why isn't she here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>I left my family... when Gracie was six. I was sort of forced out, actually, after I'd had an affair with a student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For sex or love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>Neither. I'd only married Gracie's mother because of the baby. But I didn't think I could handle commitment, and, like any decent academic, I proved myself right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And what time it is matters because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>She's a dance teacher in Atlanta. She gets home from work at 9:00, and I just wanted to speak to her one more time. That's my story. What's yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Same thing. Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>I'm gonna be dead in a few hours. Your secrets couldn't be safer. Unless you're keeping them from yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like being alone. At least I convince myself that I'm better off that way. And then I met someone… at a psychiatric hospital, of all places. She changed me. And then she left. We're better off alone. We suffer alone. We die alone. Doesn't matter if you're a model husband or father of the year. Tomorrow will be the same for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Nash</speaker><content>But yesterday would have been different.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Could you cook me up a chicken sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Daria</speaker><content>Grill's closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's important medically. Dr. Hadley needs a high-protein meal right now. She doesn't like to talk about it, but she has hypoproteinemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Daria</speaker><content>We got chicken salad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. That's cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Daria</speaker><content>She needs to eat warm protein for this disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, we could give her cold protein whose uptake enzymes haven't been activated, as long as you don't mind her risking liver and kidney failure and eventual death. But, hey, it's worth it so you don't have to flip on the grill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Daria</speaker><content>You don't have to be obnoxious about it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> How do you look so okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I spent months wondering how I made it go bad. If you never loved me, then – then I didn't do anything wrong.  Hey. Allison, come on. It's all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I still don't know why I said that. It's not even true. I did love you. Just... not in a way that would have ever worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because everything you said is true. I'm a mess. I married a man I knew was dying. So God knows how screwed up I already was. Him dying messed me up even more. I pushed you out of my life. And I-I'm unfixable.  Not you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm sorry too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, I didn't even play fair. You asked me how my dad reacted when I told him I was bisexual. And the Huntington's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No tea party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I never told him. He's been through enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So he just visits his heterosexual, healthy daughter, and you go out to dinner and a movie and talk about your garden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I work late. He's staying at my house. It's easier if I stay elsewhere as much as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You can't suppress your life for his convenience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't see a little irony in that? That's exactly what you do for House. When he moved in with you, you bought a bigger place for him. No wonder you're not dating anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're right. That woman, the woman I'm not involved with, her name is Sam Carr. But in 1990 and 1991, it was Sam Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Your ex-wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, my mother. Yes, my ex-wife. Ex number one. She friended me a few weeks ago. We started emailing. It turns out she's recently divorced, and I wanted to ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You can't take a woman to dinner, or else House will go running straight back to the loony bin? You're not worried about House. You're worried about yourself. Because she's an ex. So even dinner will mean it's immediately serious.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What are your favorite parts that you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I liked how I would wake up in the middle of the night, you'd put your arm around me, and you wouldn't even wake up. I liked watching you stand up to your dad at Christmas when he yelled at your mom. How you didn't even know you were strong. But you were. What do you miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I miss a lot. But when I think about missing you, I think about that dance class that we took for the wedding. It's weird. I think, he's never gonna hold me like that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm gonna miss this too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Led a group of surgeons to fix cleft palates in Bangladesh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What can I say? That concert was very moving to me. I have to take a knee. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't get it. This has got to be the most spectacular file down here. Why are you pretending to be ashamed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I would trade mine for yours in a second. When I was in med school, I thought I'd be House some day. Instead, I am a fellow working with – working for people years younger than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So… We both have a few regrets.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Maldonado</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Smits</speaker><content> What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Adrienne, give me your arm.  The hair on her left arm is standing up. Asymmetric neurological function. She's having a pilomotor seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Smits</speaker><content>She seemed fine a minute ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She was.  She's probably been having complex seizures all day. She would be basically functional, but more or less acting on autopilot. She probably dropped the towels off twice. She could have taken the baby.</content></utterance>
