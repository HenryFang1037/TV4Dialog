<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Hey. How long have I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Blunt force trauma to the head did the fatal damage. Since the accident, he's had a continuous…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I can't get up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>No episodes of hyperten…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What's wrong with my legs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>EKG's show normal…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Hey. Someone talk to me. You don't hear me talking to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Normal feeling, pressure, normal C.K. Troponin…  Great heart for transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Who. My heart? Oh, God! They don't know I'm in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, genius. I think it violates certain ethical laws to rip the organs out of a guy who's still alive. Possibly certain law laws too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Thank you. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Could you, um, get back in your bed, please, Mr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's actually Doctor House. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> This guy's a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's also Navy Seal House. But you're going to have to save up for that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Really? Well, that's interesting, but… you're here because you crashed your motorcycle, not because I need a consult. So, get back in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Scraped my elbow. I just need a truckload of Vicodin. Whereas, this guy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>He's brain dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No, I'm not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>So drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Minimal brain waves don't mean he's alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I am alive! I'm here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>No EKG response to painful stimuli, hot or cold. What you're seeing is random, barely discernable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I discerned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Listen to him, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>No, that's just the amplifier's internal noise level. It's on increased sensitivity. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No, no, no, it's not! It's me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then why is his eye following you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content> Following motion's an involuntary reflex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You're a doctor… you should know these things. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No, no, I'm not dead. I need help. I'm here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I also know about locked-in syndrome… That things are either involuntary… or voluntary. Blink if you can hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I hear you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, this is going to be fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Eye movement is deliberate. Can you blink once for "yes," twice for "no?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The square root of nine?  He got that faster than you. Brain is fully functional. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Lee…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Where's Molly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You were in an accident.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Lee, hit the brake, hit the brake, hit the brake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You've sustained a traumatic injury to your brain stem, which has cut off your brain's ability to communicate with the rest of your body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Can you fix me? Where's Molly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You still have movement in your eyes. So we can get you to a rehab facility where they can teach you how to communicate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No, I can't be stuck like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless… the crash didn't cause the brain damage. Maybe the brain damage caused the crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Yeah. I couldn't stop. Why couldn't I stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Look at his palms. No scrapes. He didn't even try to protect himself. Suggests slowed reflexes… or no reflexes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You're not a doctor in this hospital. You are a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Yeah, and you're the guy who wants to cut out my organs, and he's the guy who doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Get me the scans. Stroke, cancer, even a simple infection. Anything that insults the central pons could do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Then that means that I could be fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>You're giving him false hope. He needs to accept what's happened. And work on making the most of it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Molly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Don't look at me like that. That's not making me feel better. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>I don't know how God is going to get us through this. But he will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop it. I'm blushing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just looking for some reading material for the crapper. These CTs —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>Get back in your bed. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>The children are in the waiting area. Can I bring them in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No. No, don't. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>You don't want to see them? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I don't want them having nightmares. I don't want to scare them, Molly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>You don't want them to see you?  It's okay. I understand. You're going to be better soon enough. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> You really that sure? Why are you so sure, babe? How'd you get so sure?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Never better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Here's your burger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you can't bring Mohammed to Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed. That's my diagnostics posse. Hot, dark and darker. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Talk about getting me better, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What are you doing up in Middletown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Buying a Gibson '57 Goldtop. It's the guitar Duane Allman used to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Next to the trauma, the most likely causes of a sudden onset of locked-in syndrome are basilar artery stroke and brain hemorrhage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>CT was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Man, those fries look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Certain circulatory diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guy's an active bike rider, his heart's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Jeez, is the last thing I ate gonna be the last thing I ate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It could evade the CT and still show up on an MRI with contrast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> It was a melted PowerBar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's the smart one. I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota. If we find it, treat it, you could be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I never thought I'd be praying for a brain tumor, but please, dear God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you're praying in there, stop it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We'll get his doctor to order an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His doctor's busy teaching him how to blink out "kill me" in Morse code. Luckily, I found some forms under the mattress. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Check it out, they have those MRI video goggles. I heard these were awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's a beach. Oh, look, there's Taub… drinking a margarita and mocking us for driving all the way up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Easy, I can still feel in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Excuse Dr. Kutner. He gets a little excited about new technology. It can get loud in there, and a little closed off. These will put you in a quiet place. You can create a relaxing scenario for yourself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I hope they…  work… wow.  You're in my relaxing scenario?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I guess you like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Either that or you got sent here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? By God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I'm not sure if I believe in God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You spend an awful lot of time in church for someone who doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I don't not believe either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's either one or the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I go to church mainly to keep my wife happy, but… I don't know, I've never actually thought that God could reach out and affect my life. But getting a brilliant doctor in the bed next to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>I think Molly was right. I think you were sent here to make me get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Drake</speaker><content>Hey, Dad. Making a volcano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>You're making a volcano? Looks like it. What you doing, baby?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hope you don't mind. My new roommate snores. And my new room doesn't have you.  Your MRI showed a lesion in the central pons. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What is that? What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See it there? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mm, that's what they said. But it's there. Which means no way head trauma did this. It's cancer, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome. Unfortunately, your current doctor thinks its diffuse nature means an infection. Now the bad news is, the antivirals he's got you on might kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I'm not gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But the good news is if they just almost kill you, then Dr. Idiot will realize that his name is not a coincidence and he'll let me do whatever I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, the irony here is… you're kind of fascinating. So many questions. But if you could answer any of them, then you wouldn't be fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I get it. You're a little nuts, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your wife is the one getting you through this. Your wife and me. Although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding. I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> If he had a wife, he’d know why it matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a good guy. Easy to talk to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Wait, something's happening. What's happening to me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Need some help in here! Your patient is seizing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Why would he have a seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he has cancer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>His brain stem is compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Why are you still arguing with this guy? You thought I was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Welcome back. And nicely played. You almost died.  Exactly as we planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>You knew this was going to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer. Right, doctor? My turn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>It's cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>No, it isn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A small tumor in his brain stem, causing paraneoplastic syndrome. He needs plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Can you give that to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Kurtz</speaker><content>No no, I'm sorry, I completely disagree with Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Please shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't. Which means I can treat him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Let him. Let him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Is that what you want? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Absolutely. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you send up a couple of bellboys?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fresh infusion of macho. You like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I can't move, and she's worried about his boo-boo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What were you doing up there, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Antiquing. I found you a late Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Is he hitting on her?  If she turns around, she's into him too.  And there you have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably because there was no message. I've decided to accept your resignation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, I thought we were past this. I decided to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you didn't. You had it decided for you. So now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else. Which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas. Unless I'm wrong. Save the cheerleader. Save your world.  I got it from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I thought you already solved this. You thinking you might be wrong? What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Hey, just curious… what’re you driving up to Middletown for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Why does he care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because I'm your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was buying a guitar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, I heard that. It used to belong to a guitarist who died in a motorcycle accident. It just reeks of you screwing with people. Your crash was ten miles from the Orange County Progressive Pain Clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You live ten miles from Mary's Dress Shop. And yet, that's not even on my list of reasons that I think you're secretly a transvestite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you're going to another state to get more narcotics…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> He's on drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>…who lives in Thompson Ridge. I let her know about the extra money you're making on the lecture circuit. So she'll be sure to adjust your alimony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You wouldn't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. I wouldn't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> You guys are friends?</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Shouldn't we be entertaining our patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I performed Euripides with sock puppets. You just missed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>House said we should. The mind is like a muscle. If you don't exercise it, it'll atrophy, just like anything else. Whoever's with him needs to talk. Keep his mind active. And it'll show House you still care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not sure if I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Jeez, you're my doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Then why don't you just quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not sure I want to do that, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Oh. Maybe you should figure it out before House figures it out for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Yeah, maybe you should have your midlife crisis after I'm better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Kutner… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We'll be right back.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Do you drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's a roofer. Alcohol hardly proves your theory.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>LFT's are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Speak English. Is it fixable? What does that mean?  That hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No tremors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How much do you drink? A six-pack a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I hate beer, I don't even drink beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could mean he drinks more or less, or maybe something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It may not be alcohol at all. Street opiates could also cause locked-in…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I don't get high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>…MPPP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either we play 20,000 questions with every street drug, or instead of talking to him, we talk to the lesion.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea. It's sort of where I was heading.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Blood in your urine clogged up your old catheter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Peeing blood? That must be what the insecure doctor saw.  Ahhhhhhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Every new clue gets us closer to the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The surgery will get us more clues.  You have visitors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No. Oh, Molly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You can come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Jolie</speaker><content>Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Drake</speaker><content>Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I told you not to bring them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Well, they wanted to see their father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I can't even hug them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>They can handle it. It's going to be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> You're not so sure anymore, are you? They must've told you that it's dangerous. That I could die. And that's why you brought them in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Drake</speaker><content>I got an A+ on my test.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Maybe you should go now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Oh, no. They can stay, please. Let them stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Jolie</speaker><content>Bye, Daddy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then we'll wake you back up. We need you to answer some simple yes or no questions while we're cutting, to make sure we're not cutting anything…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> It seems to be working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Deep breaths. In about ten seconds, you'll feel lightheaded. And by now… you should be floating…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God's mistakes are well-documented. If he'd done everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Those were because of human mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think your doctor has an apartment on Mount Olympus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>God put me with you for a reason. I'm gonna be all right still, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don't know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lee. You with me now? Easy questions. You'll be done before you know it. Is this equation correct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What, so if you make a mistake, I'm not going to know that anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Are these lines parallel?  Spatial relationships intact. Take a look at this circle. Is more than half of it shaded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don't forget to blink. Is more than half of the circle shaded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Sorry, yes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Blink. Come on, Lee, blink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Foreman, back out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blinking and eye movements are controlled by a small cluster of nerves just millimeters from the biopsy site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>But he's still in there, right? I mean, he just can't communicate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He had one way to communicate and now that's gone. Well played.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Epstein-Barr, picornaviruses, malaria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He runs a business, meets a lot of people he could've picked up rotavirus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did he report having bloody diarrhea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The wife's not sure, says he doesn't complain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you ask him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We've prioritized. He can only blink, a real history would've taken weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he had Epstein-Barr, he'd have belly pains. If he had picornavirus, he'd have headaches. Five other yes/no questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give. And what treatment would kill him. Unless he's already dead.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. This has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain. I was heading to the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm. Either that or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes. For example, I just lied to him about Missouri malaria.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Amazing. A man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I'm not lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you were getting some really strange strange, you could've contracted neurosyphilis. Infection went to your brain, froze you right up. Good news is it's treatable. You'll be up and moving in time to sign the divorce papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Why would I tell you the truth about being in St. Louis,  and then not tell you the truth about this?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Doing what I had to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Metal filings. Judging by the color, I'd say cadmium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which he'd aerosolize with the broom, then right into his lungs. Heavy metal poisoning explains everything.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Somebody will be here at all times to uh, irrigate your eyes, keep you company. Hopefully, it'll help make the time go quicker.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thank you… for thinking "up." For helping me find you in there. Man, when you moved that cursor… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Bought my first girlfriend a necklace. It was silver. It cost 180 bucks… had to save for six months. She hated it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Really, seriously? Did you tell this story to someone who could walk away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Never bought another girlfriend jewelry again. Until Dr. Hadley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> You're dating her? You might want to start all your stories with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Same thing. She didn't even wear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>The diamond thing? She was wearing it the other day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If she doesn't like it, she doesn't like it. Apparently, I suck at picking out jewelry, but least have the guts to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Okay, getting boring again. How long till we know if this treatment is working?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>You lied to me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. All you gotta do is come up with a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How about we hook the guy's brain to a computer, so he can communicate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a great idea. For the guy who invented the computer that can read minds. Your idea was to use his idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You didn't come up with it. No one else came up with it. If I didn't re-establish communication, we never would have found —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's interesting is why you're here now. Not when I gave you the ultimatum. Was it something the patient said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I realized that what we do here… terrifies me. And… overcoming that is the only way I can matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kutner found the battery factory. Kutner came up with the cadmium. Maybe you don't matter.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Hand me the flourescein stain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> What's that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Epithelium looks torn. These drops sting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'm going to close your left eye to keep it protected. I'm going to blink your eye a few times to distribute the dye.  Ulcerative keratitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Means it's not cadmium poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> Which means you don't know what's wrong. Again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I assume you went over all of that with your team. I also assume they didn't have any brilliant ideas, or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself. This is going to hurt. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ow!  The way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Road debris has come to the surface. I'm going to have to scrub it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But the initial acyclovir would've treated that. Which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease. Like Behcet's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Here… this is going to hurt even more.  Take two now, two later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oops.  Ho! Of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do an LP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You've been in the ER too long. When the patient had head trauma, white blood cells only indicate that he had head trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or you could use the LP for something useful. If you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, Behcet's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why did I fire you again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records. You've never had any contact with anyone at Fishkill. So, I ask again… What were you doing up in Middletown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know what's more interesting than what I was doing? The reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Stop deflecting, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Says the deflector. The reason I was up there is the reason you're scared I was up there. I was checking out your dirty, little secret. How long have you been sleeping with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How… how did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing. And the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> No. No. Let me go. He can't fix me. I've been here for three days, everything hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The arrest means the demyelination hit the area in his brainstem that controls heart rhythm. We need answers fast, ‘cause this is going to happen again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Shut up, shut up.  He's trying to talk.  Is something bothering you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Is it your eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why is he saying "no" three times? You only asked one question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe he's not saying "no," maybe he's saying "down."  Are you saying that the pain is lower?  How low, your leg?  Your foot? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Left foot?  Check his… let me see now… yeah, his right foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation?  Is it itching? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Itchy foot means liver failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't say "failing," I said "failure." Just like you. Liver's like a cruise ship taking on water. As it starts to sink, it sends out an S.O.S. Only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes. The more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is. And once the ship has sunk, there's no more S.O.S. You think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Liver, plus eye, plus kidney… most likely sclerosing cholangitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, God, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending. Do a biopsy to confirm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm going to numb up the area where we'll go in for the punch biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Where's the new bracelet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She was wearing the bracelet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You didn't notice that I was wearing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because you weren't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He noticed, and you didn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you don't like it, it's fine. It's not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I like it, that's the point. I'd rather have it at home in the jewelry box than getting peed on at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You got the patient's urine on that arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When I was putting in the catheter. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You've got a rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The bracelet's real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I figured. So what if the rash isn't just a rash? What if it's an infection? If there were rats in that basement, then the liver failure could be caused by leptospirosis. It transfers through urine. Rat pee to him, his pee to you. The infection would need an entry point. Look for any recent scratches, cuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Look. Next to his fingernail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The infection destroyed your liver, which released toxins that caused the locked-in syndrome. You were dying of a paper cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I hope you're right this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Let’s start him on high dose penicillin G.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We found rats in your buddy Dave's basement. Tested positive for leptospirosis. That means we're on the right treatment. So… try moving a finger. Your brain needs to get used to doing its job again. Try harder. I'm sure you've lost hope. I know we've told you several times that we knew what this was, but this time we're right. Concentrate. Move one finger for me.  Welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content> I did it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rat pee. Very nice idea. Who came up with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I did. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good.  You okay with him claiming the credit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It was his idea. He saw the rash —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he did, he'd have hung a "mission accomplished" banner in my outer office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie. That's all I needed to know. Rat pee. That's a very nice idea.</content></utterance>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House. You left this in my office. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it. Because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it. You would've thrown her right in my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me.  So I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking. You're seeing a psychiatrist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You had no right to invade my privacy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is… is that…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. It's irony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>Lee</speaker><content>Hey. God sent you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Suddenly, you're not so fascinating. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're spying on your team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Prioritize, Wilson. Is that what you really want to torture me about right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing. Not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my childhood wasn't perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to believe that maybe something else has changed.  Maybe you think you can change. Credit Cuddy with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not much credit to take, because I'm not going back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, House, please… I assume you went because you're tired of screwing up every chance you get at happiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Delete contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do not let the fact that I found out about it —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You'll end up alone.</content></utterance>
