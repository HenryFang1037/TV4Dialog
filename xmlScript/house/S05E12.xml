<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>I can't play without a stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Then I guess you won't play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>I don't care. I suck anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Don’t say that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>No, you're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>Then who's worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Don’t worry about anyone else. Just do your best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>See? You can't name anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Zach, stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>Then name someone.  You can't, can you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>You really think I’m better than those guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Yes.  Hurry up and get your stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Zach, get back in the car.  I need an ambulance at 860 Oakwood Avenue!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>Why is dad's car on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Get back in the car, Zach!  Come on. Come on! Oh, come on. Don’t do this to me, Jeff! Don’t do this!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I was up all night looking at finance reports, and Rachel is doing great. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Proving that you're a better foster mom than a homeless drug addict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Departmental budgets are due this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m gonna need an extension. Got some time next decade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Cameron already turned yours in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s nice of her. Two questions — Why did she? And why are you telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Same answer — now you owe her a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m gonna need an extension. I got some time —-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, I’ve got a DYFS home visit on Friday.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>32-year-old male with chronic pain all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is the favor? I was expecting something involving whipped cream and tongue depressors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s seen seven different specialists over three years. No diagnosis and no relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I am fascinated already. It’s like I’m treating myself. He gets cured, and I get to learn a valuable lesson about the milk of human kindness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If I thought you learned lessons, I never would've quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're wasting a favor because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think you can help this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Drug-seeking patients —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Don’t attempt suicide with medicine cabinets full of narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Sounds like fibromyalgia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sounds like you don't work for House. A diagnosis that provides neither an explanation nor a cure is by definition not a diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The American College of Rheumatology would disagree. There are specific diagnostic criteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which this guy doesn't meet. Putting pressure on his pain helps, doesn't make it worse. He’s got abdominal pain, severe headaches, muscle cramps that come and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And he tried to off himself. He’s obviously mentally ill. Pain’s probably psychological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It is not a sign of mental illness to want to be pain-free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It is if your solution is sucking on a tailpipe. Sane people don't attempt suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Not ever? So if you were being burnt at the stake… And someone handed you a gun…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I’d shoot the guys with the torches. Not one doctor this guy has seen in the past three years has been able to find a single thing wrong with him. What does that tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It means they're idiots. It means we got to start from the beginning.  We’ll do a pain profile to rule out psychosomatic pain.  Search the home.  Go home.  Get a refill… And a doughnut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’ll help with the home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Choose a statement in each group that best describes how you've been feeling lately, including today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I’m not depressed. I know what I did was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I usually sleep well. I have some trouble with sleep. I have a lot of trouble with sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I have a lot of trouble.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>It’s up and down. Between the pain and the meds, his sleep pattern's pretty erratic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He’s a calm person. He’s more nervous than most people. He’s so nervous, he's miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>He’s definitely calm. Sometimes calmer the worse the pain gets. I think talking, interacting with other people actually makes it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Why? Does that mean something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, it's just we've seen that in other… patients.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He can do chores around the house. With help, he can do chores. He no longer can do chores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>He helps all the time. He’s really strong. He used to play hockey. And he was really good too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I believe there's hope. Hoping for things to get better is a struggle for me. Most of the time, I feel completely hopeless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>He still laughs… All the time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content> He was always optimistic. He still is. It’s just… it's harder now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I guess… I pray for strength more than hope.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s nothing in there but a pharmacy's worth of pain meds. This guy makes House look like a Christian Scientist. He’s also more compliant than House. Kept all the inserts, had daily pill dispensers to make sure he didn't mix them up.  I guess if you're gonna go out in a car, this ain't a bad one to choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If I ever did it, definitely wouldn't be like that. Don’t worry. I’m not making any plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I certainly wouldn't know. Ever since we kissed, you've been avoiding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, I haven't. Just been busy. Metal polish could cause nerve damage if he inhaled enough of it. Judging by the shine on that car, he used a fair amount.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Judging by the fact that he owns a body shop and  one of these, I’d say he knew not to inhale. Busy tonight? We can get some dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So making out, okay. Meals, too intimate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't want to kiss you again either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why? Because we work together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. Because I like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That makes a lot of sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What doesn't make sense is me getting involved with anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought you'd gotten past that. That’s why you agreed to the drug trial. You can't give up on life because —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I’m not giving up on life. I’m just giving up on you. I finally feel like I have a grip on things. I can handle this. What I can't handle is dragging anyone else down with me.  Does this look like quail to you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think he's had food poisoning every day for the last three years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Wild quail can be toxic, cause rhabdomyolysis, which would explain his pain, as well as the elevated CK levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So would the carbon monoxide he sucked out of his car. It’s not a toxic reaction. It’s a psychosomatic reaction. The pain profile showed an excessive concern about his physical health, difficulty sleeping, getting out of bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s not in pain because he's depressed. He’s depressed because he's in pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not according to the pain profile you ordered. It’s not a diet issue. We should start him on antidepressants for his sake, as well as his family's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We’re not diagnosing his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We’re not diagnosing you either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s rhabdo. Push IV fluids, check his urine, do a muscle biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What muscle? He says it hurts all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then she'll biopsy all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If Cuddy can come in late, I can leave early. If you need anything while I’m gone, just ask Cameron to do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>So if he just stops eating quail, the pain will go away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If we're right, it's definitely treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>My arm! It’s starting to —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>He needs more medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>BP is down. We need to get him in Trendelenburg position. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Jeff, can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He’s arresting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> We need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He’s not answering his cell either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>VQ scan showed a pulmonary embolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Means the pain's not psychosomatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It also means it's not rhabdomyolysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Up till now, his heart and lungs were the only places he didn't have pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Means it's getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got to let the phone ring more than four times when you're calling a cripple. Chronic pain and pulmonary embolism, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How’d you know he had —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You called after midnight. It’s got to a heart problem. Heart only would be consistent with rhabdo, which means Thirteen and Foreman would be singing in the rain, which means it has to be lungs as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Hypercoagulable state could cause pain and a PE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think the blood clot was caused by a clotting problem. That’s helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What if it's a cancer syndrome, like Trousseau's? Explains blood clots, multifocal pain, lack of obvious physical signs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And why he's gone three years without anyone seeing it. Check his chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why did he think only you two would be singing in the rain?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Bone windows are normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Checking for cancerous masses in the lungs. So, uh, who do you know who committed suicide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hemingway, Goebbels, Romeo and Juliet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Your mom? Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Saying I wouldn't do it under any circumstances means my whole family was suicidal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Nope, but categorically insisting there are no circumstances means you've got baggage — Personal betrayal, abandonment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just because you grew up in a Charles Dickens novel…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Well, it's people like me who don't do it. When your life sucks from the beginning, there's nowhere to go but up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thorax is clear. No tumors in the lungs. The only betrayal comes from father of the year in there. He has a wife, a kid — People who count on him to have a pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Okay. Switching to high-res cuts of the abdomen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My parents live very happily in Queens. They never attempted, thought about, or attempted to think about committ —  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There, along his diaphragm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That’s not cancer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No hurry. I already bathed once this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>Can’t do anything till I write up an estimate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. Pad it all you want. Here’s a check for the deductible. Don’t touch the piano and lock up when you leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>Sorry, deductible doesn't apply here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I’m no architect, but I’m pretty sure the master bedroom is part of the home, which means the home warranty —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>Doesn’t cover negligence. This pipe goes through the ceiling, over that wall, and into your shower. It didn't burst. It was pulled apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, 'cause I’m clearly a guy who likes to knock out a few naked pull-ups before I greet the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>You hang laundry in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m about to hang a plumber in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>Look, there's no rust. There’s no corrosion. I don't know how it happened, but I know what happened, and it's not covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Plumber</speaker><content>Whenever you're ready to spend the $2,200… Give somebody else a call. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I promise, I’m only holding your hand to check for choreiform movement. I’m getting absolutely no intimacy from it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I told you, it has nothing to do with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know. That’s the problem. There’s 80 reasons we shouldn't date, but you can't shut everyone out. You’re gonna need help, support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Look at our patient. 32 years old, not dead yet, and already he's traumatized his wife, his son —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And I’ll bet they're cherishing every traumatic minute he has left, wouldn’t trade him for the healthiest guy in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>True. And they're stuck suffering with him, hating every day. Only their pain has no prospect of relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This a bad time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No trace of cancer in the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>But we did find edema in his intestines, air in the intestinal blood vessels, and House won't answer his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His intestine must be damaged. The air's leaking into his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If there's a blockage in the superior mesenteric artery, it could be choking off blood flow to his intestine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Blockages all over his body would explain his pain, why the cramps come and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Do an angioplasty on the superior mesenteric and find the other blockages before he has another cardiac arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I’ll help. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good thing we don't have a suicidal patient with a horrific, undiagnosed pain disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We did till we diagnosed it. We found intestinal edema and air in the blood vessels. Pain was vascular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it was vascular, we would've seen uneven pulses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His blood pressure was uneven. Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He had hemorrhages in his fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There’s air in the intestine. It has to have come from somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yes, it does. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>After we thread the catheter through his groin and into position, the blood will start flowing freely again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Zach</speaker><content>Will that take away the pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away. Cancel the angio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He has air in his blood vessels. If we don't open the artery to his intestines —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Where can air come from? Hmmm.  Air can either come from a breach in the lumen in the small intestine, or in rare instances, air can come from the air.  Teeth marks. I’m guessing from when he blew into his IV tube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Air bubble caused the PE and cardiac arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You tried to finish the job that you started at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Lynne</speaker><content>Jeff… Why? You said that you never —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I lied. I wanna die. Please just let me die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>He’s in a hyperbaric chamber. A dose of high pressure ought to chase the air out of his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is anyone keeping an eye on him, because this whole idea of suicidal watch was specifically created for suicidal patients. I realize how you might've thought the name was just a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are there any visuals in this room that are key to us learning our lesson? 'Cause the telephone —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.  When was the last time you showered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Scent of a man! I realize you haven't experienced it sober.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Anyone should be able to handle a depressed pain patient…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He insisted he was no longer —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Apparently he lied. Didn’t think I’d have to remind you of that remote possibility. I have a DYFS inspection in less than 24 hours, so if you can't control —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Non-motor seizures.  Sorry, I was thinking about the patient. What were you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The pain started in his abdomen near his intestine. The first symptom has got to be key.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't make the schedule, and if I did, I wouldn't use it as a social lubricant. And this is the first I’ve heard of Janice improving at all. So, hey, thanks for the good news.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pain started in his abdomen. Now it's hopped from his left thumb to his left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We're getting sued?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably. That’s Cuddy's problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hopping pain, means it's something in his brain, not his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain. Which means you're not using yours. Come on, you're from one of the 12 tribes. You know must know a ton of shysters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What type of lawyer do you need? I’ll bring it up at the next world domination subcommittee meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn’t say I needed a lawyer. I said I needed the name of a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pain hopped to another limb on the same side. It’s got to be central —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Could still be peripheral. If multiple areas of disc disease —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Were consistent with a completely spotless MRI.  Who represented the hospital when you set that patient on fire?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What was the name of the firm?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine, you want to separate a patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And what about options three, four, and five? His respiratory system freezes, or he dies of infection, or he leaks CNS fluid like a fire hydrant, which would make him wish he were dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You need to scratch option five. He’s already there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You preach objectivity, but as soon as a patient comes in in pain, all you want to do is look under the hood. You don't care if there's a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Left them all back on Krypton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>You’re alone. That’s why you can handle your pain. No need to put up a front, to be what anyone else wants you to be. You’re having more bad days lately, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yes. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Carlton</speaker><content>Everything looks fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Carlton</speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy, you've got sufficient income, a high degree of personal and professional stability, and you care enough to be embarrassed by what a mess this place is. Believe me, that puts you head and shoulders above most of the foster moms I visit. See you next year, if you haven't adopted her by then.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I have principles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>Fernando</speaker><content>Because you paid more to bribe me to lie on your claim than the entire cost of the repair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care if I pay, as long as the people who pocketed my premiums for the last nine years also pay. I didn't break the pipe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>Fernando</speaker><content>Whatever. If you want to stick it to the man, that's fine by me.  You happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, but I’m right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>STDs, testosterone issues, that summer on Fire Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, so close. The correct answer is epilepsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Epilepsy doesn't cause chronic pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does if it spreads to the sensory region of the brain, then rewires the pain neurons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Would’ve shown up on an EEG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not if the seizures are in a place you can't see on an EEG, a place too deep in the brain, like the area that controls the muscles supporting the…</content></utterance>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Feels like you got kicked in the nads, doesn't it?  The abdominal pain, how it all started. It wasn't the stomach. It was lower, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>It’s everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But when it first started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>It started in the stomach — cramps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, like bad gas, or a permeating pain… Like your kidneys were being pulled out through your scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because epilepsy is treatable.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>Rita</speaker><content>The medication. When we switch out the bags, you can smell it. It’s disgusting.</content></utterance>
