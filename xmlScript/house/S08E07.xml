<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather." I'm thinking of going hang gliding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Pax river is, like, completely flat. I think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.  I like naval stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like their oranges and lint. What looks like kidney disease, but isn't?  And where's Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Root canal and Berger's. The first one was regarding Chase. Root canal, if done correctly, doesn't look like kidney disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Got a case for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Smells funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction. It stumped two E.R. docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year. Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>This patient died five years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't say which side of the door he was on.  The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting. Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I thought it was relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Death is a consequence, not a symptom. If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Shouldn't we be trying to maximize what we can save here? 14-year-old, your freedom, our asses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Right… save your asses.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>She was in a car accident when she was two. She only had minor injuries, but her father died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That was 12 years ago. You think that's pertinent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>No, I think it's sad. She got sick in the middle of her 14th birthday party. Which is sad and pertinent. Maybe she was opening a present that triggered the reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pissing contest with Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Last thing she ate was strawberry cake, but allergy tests for everything were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Do you like your dentist? I'm still going to my pediatric one. What's your dentist's name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Williams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What if it's not an allergic reaction? Hereditary angioedema or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You're not sure of his name? You just saw him this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His assistant's name is Angie. Her home number is…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Normal complement studies. No skin lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> You had a manicure. This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist. Why would you lie about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>To avoid having this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Elevated BP. What about pheochromocytoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which could be triggered by certain opioids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you. You can't be embarrassed about a manicure. There's gotta be a deeper reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Did House give you homework?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>She's not on any meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Haven't you heard? Everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And the tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Feel free to jump in at any time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel. You see what the patient says about drug use when her mother's out of the room. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>No, never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Nobody's here to bust you, Iris. We just need to know if…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>No, I already told you. I just take vitamin C sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>Opening a birthday present. The Magic 8 Ball.  The joke gift, not the cocaine. Is that it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Certain drugs could explain her reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>What kind of drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What kind did you have in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>Iris has always been a moody girl. And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse. So for the past few months I've been… giving something to relax her. Diazepam.  I tell her it's vitamin C. Being normal is very important to Iris. She couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Anti-anxiety medications would explain it. If we keep her off, she'll be moody, but healthy.  Or it's something else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need to DDX a patient with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I thought you had a team for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>According to Foreman, they're only for DDXing people who are still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have a dead patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers. I don't see creed, color, pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Foreman will find out you're taking this case and he'll bust you. But you know that, which means… you want to go back to jail… because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting. Four-year-old kid. His kidneys died, they transfused. His lungs died. He died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Have you seen Bride of the Monster? I just got the Ed Wood box set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if the chicken was the egg? What if the lung involvement came first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't really care about the movie. I just don't want to indulge your…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because this is a bad idea, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue…  Damn!  I just realized I'm late for my anger management class.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Gene</speaker><content>Traffic, for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Dixon</speaker><content>Taxes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Lena</speaker><content>Spoiled grandchildren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Platitudes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Gene</speaker><content>Any others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child.  Am I right, Emory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Gene</speaker><content>I don't think Emory wants to share right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They blew it, didn't they? They missed your son's rash. A faint one, on his cheek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content> He didn't have a rash. I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're alive. Was he sensitive to sunlight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Gene</speaker><content>Greg…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cold fingers and toes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wegener's granulomatosis. I need to examine your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content>You're a bit late for that… you ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order. Find out what killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content>Ex-wife. And you'll never get her consent. She's moved on… new hub, new kid. She wants nothing to do with Drew's death. Or me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're angry because your kid died. More than that, because you don't have an answer. People need answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content> He's in a crypt at St. Jude's Cemetery.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You feeling any pain or cramping here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>A bit. But not just there, um… here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Breast tenderness. Have you been having regular periods, Iris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think we should run a pregnancy test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>Iris isn't sexually active. She doesn't even have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Pregnancy would explain all of her symptoms. Can even cause some unpredictable allergic reactions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>We just need a drop of blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>My… my arms. I can't feel my arms.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More like 13 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>Before we proceed any further, doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect.  I think they got the cause of death wrong. And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>Please be respectful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>I prepared the sarcophagus for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you, Igor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Milton</speaker><content>It's Milton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You owe me a new pair of pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> She is pregnant. Test came back positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So… she lost the use of her arms and her innocence. A vengeful God?  Or…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Cerebral tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Vasculitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> MS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I gather from the silence that Chase isn't there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nope, I'm here. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Nowhere"… he said cryptically. I assume you concur with the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even though there are three diagnoses? And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> He's had his eyebrows waxed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I met a woman who likes her men well groomed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All over?  I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Question is… is this really about a woman? Or is it about something more profound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an STD? HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow. In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.  And check Chase for testosterone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Blood work was negative for HIV. All the money's on tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>How was the Brazilian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was fine. Hurt a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What about House's theory? Why'd you really do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>'Cause I'm vain and shallow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>And you weren't before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The girl I was seeing wasn't. There's nothing profound here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No tumor, either. It's not her brain.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Everything looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>My arm, it's…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Still nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>No, now they're sore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> Paresthesia's gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could the bruising be caused by a physical trauma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think she fell out of bed, repeatedly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>A blood disorder. Maybe thrombocytopenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy could explain bleeding problems, and pregnancy could exacerbate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boys, do a home search. Girls, do lab tests. I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Picking up dry cleaning. Filling up the tank. Violating the dead. If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I did. Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact same 45 minutes you weren't here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I admire the creativity. But what happens when the stunt doesn't work? Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet? Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours? I'm gonna call your P.O., and you're gonna go back to jail.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're an addict. And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sorry. Vicodin repeating on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're also addicted to puzzles. You show all the classic behaviors. Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Working on a medical case is not a parole violation. It's my job description.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Never mind Bride of the Monster. You need to watch Norma Rae.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate. Um, I had an appointment in this part of town, and I obviously didn't want to miss this meeting. But, uh, thank you. I'm buying. Not literally. Hey, Emory, should we, uh, powder our noses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She finishes work at 4:00. Picks up her new kid at 4:15. Gives us about 20 minutes. I made some calls. It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask rudely enough.  Was that table here?  Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content>We shouldn't be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We don't have a choice. This is the only way you're gonna get your answer. Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Emory</speaker><content>How did he look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Peaceful.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Vitamin K deficiency's a bust. Fridge has more spinach and broccoli than a farmer's market. The Brazilian… you said it hurt "a bit."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You've had one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>More than one, and you haven't. They hurt all your bits. That's my dark secret. What's yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it. I just needed to create a distraction, though. I met a TV producer at a dinner. She asked me to appear on the medical segment. Screen tested it yesterday and shot it today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're a TV doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's a one-off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When's it air?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two hours ago. Otherwise, I'd still be lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> This is what she was opening when she had her attack. Will anyone believe Chase is an actual doctor?  "Don't count on it."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Love letters.  Porn.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid. Losing a child… just breezed right through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>How do you know about my first kid…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>Where are you getting this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>You had no right to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. I deserved the slap. But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it. Apathetic hyperthyroidism. Could have kidney involvement. Could be genetic. Definitely causes apathy. I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> You know Emory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We belong to the same club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>He wants to relive this. I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content> Emory was a wonderful man. Never afraid to show his emotions. Which is great, most of the time. But when Drew died… it overwhelmed him. I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So that's why you left him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>I left because of his eyes. He had Drew's eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who used to babysit Drew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>My father, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His place or yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>Mickey</speaker><content>There are two types of people. Those who can move on, and those who can't. My father keeps up a good front, but he's just like Emory. You need to leave him alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So he has two types of people inside of him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I found out where your boyfriend lives. When I paid him a visit, he took off. Ran in front of a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>You're lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's down in the E.R. right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you know I'm lying? How do you know your boyfriend's okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>'Cause I'm right here, you dick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Iris has dissociative identity disorder. Also known as multiple personality disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>Are you saying I'm crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's the mind's response to a severe trauma. A person experiences something that's too difficult to accept, so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it. Some think it's quite a natural reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The car accident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>I was two. I don't remember anything. These personalities that I'm supposed to have… Where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They only come out when you're afraid or anxious. That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>But if there's no boyfriend, where did the bruises come from? The pregnancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When you say your boyfriend hit you, it means you actually hit yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And the pregnancy… doesn't take a boyfriend, just a boy.  You may not be aware of half the things you've done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>How could this be happening to my own daughter without me knowing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Diazepam was masking it. Taking her off made it more apparent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>But I… I wasn't on… "diazepam"? What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>That's what those vitamin pills were. Iris… I am so sorry. I just… I thought you were moody. I didn't want you to think you needed medication.  Oh, my God. I can't believe how stupid I've been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> We need you to help us with something. Different alters can he different apparent symptoms. Allergies, paresthesia, vision loss, changes in blood pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>Do you think I'm making this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your symptoms are real. But some are physiological, and others are psychological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>Faye</speaker><content>So there's something wrong with her… in addition to the multiple personalities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes, but we won't know what until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>Iris</speaker><content>Well, how do you do that?</content></utterance>
