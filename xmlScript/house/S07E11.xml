<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>If you didn't want to be insulted, you wouldn't have invited me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Yes, three glasses, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Yeah, it's not — it's not even lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>If you'd prefer, I'll make it a mimosa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>What do you think? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Perfect… for a night on the town.  Perfect for breast-feeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>My heart's doing that weird thing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Beating? That's normal for humans.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>What? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I think we need to get you to the hospital.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>TV</speaker><content>I'm dying to try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Is no one gonna tell me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Shh-shh-shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>TV</speaker><content>How delightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> Why we're in the morgue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House is on the lam from someone. Taub's got his money on Wilson, but I'm pretty sure it's Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fool's bet. There's a whole world of angry patients, creditors…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She needs a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, just not me. Your mom is a 65-year-old woman with high blood pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What about the macrocytic anemia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Borderline, which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which, by the way, matches the rest of her medical history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You really think she's psyching herself into atrial fibrillation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So get her a cardiologist. You don't want me involved. You don't want you involved. All that ethics stuff that I don't give a crap about suddenly makes sense. If you're emotionally invested, you cannot make rational decisions. You know this would be a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> This is my mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Treadmill test went well — no chest discomfort or ischemia. The abnormal rhythm will probably resolve itself, and if not, a daily pill will keep it under control. I will follow up later today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content> Is it connected to my other symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Which other symptoms, Mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Aye… Not her fault. This "Dean of Medicine" stuff — very impressive at parties. But she's forgotten how to be a real doctor. It's all in my file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are 15 years of clinic visits in this file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I don't want to be a bother. But isn't this what you do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So… we're looking for a disease that can last a decade and a half, causes constipation, diarrhea, flu, cold, dizziness, rashes, back and joint pain, "heart feeling weird," "kishkes feeling wobbly," one actual hip replacement. And which has eluded detection by years of blood work, X-rays, and MRIs. Well, one thing does pop to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> We'll monitor you, and we'll give you a thyroid test. And House's team will do a home search for environmental toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>He seems to know his stuff. How come he can't afford a coat that fits?</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No radon, no mold, no lead in the pipes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, great. Have you seen Cuddy's high-school yearbook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Okay, that is clearly not related to the case, so—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There is no case. Cuddy won't let House see the yearbook, so he figures there's something to hide. Any guesses? It's clearly related to being a giant teenage dork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So you thought I'd have some insights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. I didn't mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Relax. I was crowned homecoming geek. I'm sure you can relate…  because you knew some dorks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was the class president and head boy at — AAH!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Oh… Is that — is that Cuddy's mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Certain parts of her… and certain parts of some muscular Hispanic gentleman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Should we consider STDs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think I just caught one looking at these photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> What does "azarcon" mean? I—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It means we might have an actual case.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mexican herbal medication for stomach problems, but only in the sense that lead chromate is an herb and poison is a medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll start a chelation I.V. Thank you so much. That wasn't too much of a disaster, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know… that's not the only thing they found in her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not my yearbook…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Just some stuff that could cause severe nausea and permanent erectile dysfunction… and which proves that your mom is doing the help. According to her diary, it's some contractor named Jesus… which, granted, was originally a Jewish name, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Go, Mom. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So… why were you taking a Mexican folk remedy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>A friend uses it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A friend? Mom… just for medical reasons, you should have told me. If you're sexually active—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>At my age, he's more the active one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mom's having a fling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>She's been giving me lousy advice about it for five years. I have physical needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>He's a married man, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>She doesn't want sex with him. I do want to have sex with him. Tell me, who's being hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hold on. Five years? Why didn't you tell me about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I don't know. We don't have that kind of relationship.  Does that really surprise you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re not ready? You said you had two guys helping you move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They couldn't get out of work. I'm trying to economize. And this hotel is cheaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi. I'm sorry. I just wanted to drop off some mail and talk to you about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Rache…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chris, that's not why… We got to move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What does that mean? Have you moved on? With who? Is it Phil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't want to talk about this. I know that you're worried about money, so—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're trying to change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, which you could have gleaned from, "I don't want to talk about this." I got you a tryout to be a part-time medical consultant on lawsuits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Wait, with your brother? Have you completely forgotten the last time I saw him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That was five years ago. Jamie had just found out that you'd been cheating on me with your partner's daughter. It's a little overreaction. Might have been—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He broke my nose and then called me the most horrible person he's ever met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He shouldn't have broken your nose.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, texts, calls, and emails all go to the same magic device these days. You only got to send one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Then it's even weirder it took you so long to get down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah, that's a crazy mystery. It's not like I got a department to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>This other magic device  tells me that lead poisoning wouldn't cause all my symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. But it could cause the 5% that are real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>You think I'm a hypochondriac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, let me answer this way— maybe you're imagining that I think you're a hypochondriac.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Look, my hand just started to shake. It's a side effect of these arthritis pills. Read the label.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did… when I was typing it up, right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>You printed a fake label… just to prove I'm a hypochondriac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>It got you fired, you schmuck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>An hour to convince her to go with Dr. Kaufman, and only then because he runs internal medicine. She wanted to leave the hospital entirely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My God, a woman getting better wants to leave the hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If she's getting better, it's not because you made her feel like a fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It couldn't be more because. If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself with six new forms of cancer. She'd never leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's hard enough dealing with my mom being sick. This juvenile—  Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>Lisa, it's gonna be okay, but she's in a-fib at 170.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>I think we should cardiovert while she's unsedated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll be right there.  A-fib's at 170.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wait. I'm sorry she's sick. I'm not sorry I'm off the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're not off the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't think you can convince her—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, no. You are staying on. She just can't know about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Top of the morning, Dr. Kaufman. Here's the deal. You copy me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought you spoke to Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>Yeah. Then I spoke to the elder Cuddy, who specifically requested you not be involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent, bordering on good, even. But you know I'm better. If you want, we can pretend it's 'cause I got a team and more resources. Either way, it'd be crazy to ignore my advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>It's not gonna stop at advice. You're gonna start cutting me out, go behind me to your girlfriend. And if something goes wrong, still me standing up there alone at the M Please… stay away from my patient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You bugged the room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I absolutely, without apology, will admit that someone may have allegedly done so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Guess we can pass unethical and skip straight to illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not according to the recent Supreme Court case of bite versus me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I know I'm a pain, but it's impossible for me to work with you if you—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, fine! Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later — thank you for saving America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be leukemia. Anemia from taking over the marrow, a-fib from infiltrating cardiac muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. I was really hoping for a different diagnosis — one that Kaufman hadn't already come up with. He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So we don't need to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case.  Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>DDX.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Um, we just did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, we just did the fake one. Why do you think I let the truth fairy know about the bug? I was testing her. She failed. She's still a narc. Thiamine deficiency fits better than leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think she's an alcoholic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had dinner with Arlene. I mixed her a gin and tonic. And I'd run out of the tonic, so I substituted sleeping pills. Next morning, she assumed the blackout was from the drinking. How many old ladies are used to passing out from boozing? The answer is the boozers. We're gonna have to slip her the thiamine pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We've got to run this by Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Alcoholic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treatment's very easy, safe. It's literally a few vitamin pills. It'll fix her heart, and it won't interfere with the biopsy Kaufman's running.  Put 'em in an antacid bottle. Just tell her it's for stomach problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have to ask her about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course. Absolutely. You'll ask. She'll deny. You'll push it. She'll get offended. You'll be exactly where you are now, except it'll be harder to treat. You've absolutely got to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't think she'll lie to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She just spent the last five years going south of the border down Mexico way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We have our issues, but since Dad died, we tell each other the truth when asked directly. It's important to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Addicts lie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Can I speak to Mom alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Why? You're scaring me, Lisa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mom, I think your drinking is causing your heart problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Is this about the champagne? She ordered—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Patsy and Anne told me last week you lost control at the museum luncheon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>You're talking to my friends behind my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We are all concerned. Just tell me honestly… how much have you been drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I may be your patient, but I am still your mother. And I'm telling you I am not a drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Okay.  For your stomach pains. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If something like that comes up again, just… do what you need to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And keep you out of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah. I am being a coward, which is exactly why doctors shouldn't treat their own families. Congratulations. You were right, as usual.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>The hitting you was not optimal. I was going through my own divorce at the time. I have had years of therapy. Now when I get mad, I do some deep breathing, squeeze my stress ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hey, I kind of deserved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>That's for sure. Here's the deal. I do a lot of med-mal, insurance. I need a new non-testifying expert. I'll give you one case as a tryout. You kick ass, I put you on retainer. Average 15 hours a week, it's 50 a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>50 what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>You kidding? $50,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>You drive a soft bargain. You got to sign an N.D.A.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sure. Is this…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>Uh, that's a case I'm about to settle. I rep a giant pizza-delivery company. Driver hit that kid, messed up his legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And gave him a microbleed in his brain, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This little white mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>Your predecessor checked, so did the kid's doctors. I don't know what that is, but he's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Probably. But if there's any doubt—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>It's a multimillion-dollar case. We're settling in two days. Lay off it, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay. You're right. I'm off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She spiked a fever. It's 102.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You were wrong about the alcoholism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True dat. It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Kaufman rushed the biopsies. It's not cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So there's a bright side… Kaufman was wrong too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>DDX.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay… What disease can turn Cuddy's mother into a coma patient named Stewart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lupus? We got fired from that case. We're moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We were already fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By the patient. This time by Cuddy, so it's real. She somehow realized that her completely unworkable system was completely unworkable. Okay, pop quiz, hot shots — I chose vegetable Stew for a reason. You got 60 seconds, no "hintsies." </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not gonna talk to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. You're gonna have to—  Hey!  You're good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pupils fixed and dilated — an addict, found with an empty bottle of phenobarb next to him. How is this a mystery? It's an overdose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> Glutethimide! Script filled last year. Could mimic fixed and dilated without the brain death…  Except he'll just get better on his own, so why would you take this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because House doesn't care about the treatment as long as the case is interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I'll do a blood draw and put glutethimide on the tox screen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? You thought that case was interesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, guess we're still on Arlene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Aren't there other ways of keeping Masters occupied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe it's not hypochondria. She said she gets a lot of rashes. Add the fever — sounds like autoimmune, S.L.E.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Congratulations, you can think exactly like a semi-competent internist. Kaufman's starting her on prednisone. But the heart problems were first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Endocarditis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>With no murmurs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's usually a late sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Echo showed pristine valves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Below the resolving threshold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Kaufman's prednisone will suppress her immune system — could kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You got to tell him it's endocarditis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Check the wiretap. His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him. He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We switch her meds.  We get a solution of broad-spectrum antibiotics, stick it in an I.V. bag marked for prednisone. Kaufman can only be there a few times a day. Tell Arlene you're from the pharmacy, switch 'em out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is nuts. This is way too complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's hanging an I.V. bag!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> If the attending doesn't know what she's on, the risk of drug reaction—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What risk? We know how he's treating her. We bugged the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> This is not about information! We're talking ethical and legal violations on a scale that should make even you puke!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> She's dying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That doesn't mean we should all go to jail to save her!  You're losing control because… this is your girlfriend's mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You gonna run this by Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. She said to keep her out of it, do what we need to do. Look, I know what I'm suggesting is completely screwed up. That's because this situation is completely screwed up. Do it, or you're fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We stick together, he can't fire all three of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Give me your prescription pad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because I think it's endocarditis, and I think the prednisone will kill her. And I forgot my prescription pad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Am I a horrible person? I used to win awards for volunteer work. I went to Guatemala and fixed cleft palates. Now we're sitting back letting Chase do our dirty work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're doing the right thing — stay out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't know. I don't know about anything anymore. Then this thing with the kid, Rachel's brother—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Stay out of that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>A</speaker><content>radiologists — experts, unlike you — said no bleed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>B</speaker><content>you yourself said it's probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>C</speaker><content>you've got no doctor-patient relationship.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>F</speaker><content>I'm running out of alphabet here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Had the bag, walking towards the room, and Cuddy's sister says, "Hey, Dr. Chase." I met her at that charity event last year. One of you two has got to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I met Arlene at the same benefit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Conveniently. Come on, don't ask me. I don't even know if I believe it's endo— Damn it. It's Rachel's brother. He wants me to check out some new case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Conveniently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's a tryout. I need this job. I got to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So you're just gonna ditch us, run off, and work on some other case?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Are you Timothy's mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My name is Christopher Taub. I'm a doctor at Princeton Plainsboro. I saw your son's file. I think he might have a very small bleed in his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Your son could die of a brain hemorrhage. He needs a cerebral angiogram today. Get in your car and meet me at the hospital.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Another pop quiz. How many idiot doctors does it take to switch an I.V.? The longer we wait, the more the prednisone is gonna kill her immune system. Forget playing pharmacist. Mom naps every afternoon. Wait by the room. When she falls asleep, get the sister out somehow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Hi, Dr. Cuddy, is now a good time to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So, um, you know how you had us consulting and then stopped having us consult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Um, well, I think the stopping might have… stopped. House put me on this weird case where there's no treatment — I think maybe to distract me. Uh, and they've been acting odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll look into it. Thank you for coming to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Because I-I'm worried that he's switching your mother's medications. I checked with the pharmacy — Dr. Chase got prednisone and antibiotics for my coma patient, which wouldn't treat him, but could treat conditions that cause… heart failure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You told me to keep you out of it, do what I needed to do. What the hell did you think that meant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I meant, like, if you had to slip her a few more vitamin pills or something. This is life-threatening! It's illegal. I wasn't expecting something like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it 'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Are you completely sure it's endocarditis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not a real question. Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives.  We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V. The fastest way is with you help.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Where'd Julia go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>She's got a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I've got a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>Three kids and a husband — that's a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You are always tougher on me than Julia. Why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was thinking about when you made me run for yearbook editor — I didn't want to. I didn't have a social life my whole senior year. You let Julia do whatever she wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>We're debating 12th grade now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Like anything's changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>What do you want, Lisa? Do you want to hear I love you both the same? Of course I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>But times like this, when we argue, it reminds me… I have more in common with her. She's nicer to me. I love you both… but I like her more than you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I called you three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>My phone wasn't exactly on. I figure I'll be getting some angry calls once radiology sends back the angiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>They already did.  Here… this is what you saw. It's an anatomical variant of the skull — the bone in proximity to a blood vessel. There was nothing wrong with him. That was reason "G."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's good news for him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Lungs clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>Diffuse wheezing, tightness, pruritis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's an allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>Looks like. Doesn't make any sense. She's on prednisone. How could she get an allergic reaction?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I switched out the antibiotics, put her back on prednisone — her breathing's normal. But the a-fib's back, and her fever's up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Allergy's got to be due to our antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does Kaufman know what we did? That's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, that is terrible! He doesn't know that she got worse on antibiotics, so now he's thinking endocarditis. He'll put her back on the antibiotics that almost suffocated her. What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We push through this. It started in the heart. Endocarditis still fits. It's just got to be fungal. We have to switch Kaufman's antibiotics for amphotericin B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't know if you're right. I don't care. But we are gonna end up killing this woman if we keep confusing her attending with these secret meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't care about confusing the attending! I want this woman—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore. Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself. It's a poison. That's why it kills fungi. It'll give her fever, chills—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which she already has, which will help us hide it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't think I can take a risk like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me!  Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This has blown up on you once already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm so sorry I got you guys into this. You should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know. And I'll do it, but—</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits.  But we still have to tell your mother.  I don't want to tell her, not at all. But the patient is the highest priority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm kicking you out of your office. Yes, you. This is not her office yet.  If you tell anyone, I will get you thrown out of med school, and I will destroy your career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I've thought about that. Lying about me… won't work. Everybody knows your reputation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True… but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Wait…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You drew blood. And that's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But you told me—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. As you may recall… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You set me up?  Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Because this patient is the highest priority.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Jamie</speaker><content>You made her think I was hiding her son being sick! She scuttled the settlement. She reported me to the bar.

Five years of therapy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Kaufman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>I'll never get away from House or my daughter if I stay here. Transfer me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mom… you're very ill, and you're very angry. You really think now is the right time to make a decision like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>Arlene</speaker><content>You lied to me and betrayed me. Do you think I really care what you consider a good idea anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll get the ambulance. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You just killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you blaming me? This is all because you're so arrogant, you goaded her into firing you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She would have left the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here's what I've seen. She insults you, you complain to me. I drug her at dinner, you never let her know. We slip her medicine, happens behind her back. You never confront her… and it pisses me off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you taking this personally?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She leaves, she dies. One day… maybe a week from now, maybe a year from now, you're gonna decide that the man sleeping next to you killed your mother.  Get me my patient back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You were. And I know why. You see something in me that you didn't see in Julia and you didn't see in you — a type of ambition, a type of brains. That's why you rode me. You made me yearbook editor, summa undergrad, A.O.A. in med school. The only time I ever see light in your eyes is when you hear me talking about my job. The reason you keep coming to see me in the clinic is because you trust me. You trust my medical judgment. So here it is. If you transfer to Princeton General, you'll be treated well, and you'll die. If you stay here with House, you'll be treated badly, but you'll live. I don't care if I have to slash the tires of every ambulance in this bay, Mom. I am not letting you leave my hospital.</content></utterance>
