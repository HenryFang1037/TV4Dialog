<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I don't care. I don't want to break up. I'll come on the weekends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Stanford's on the other side of the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>My dad has, like, ten million frequent flyer miles. He won't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Uh, yes, Mr. Damon. I just had something caught in my throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Oh, it's just water. I have a cough. I didn't want to disturb anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>I never knew you were such a good liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Well, a little more vodka, and you might find out some more things you didn't know about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Mr Damon</speaker><content>Nicholas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Yes, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Mr Damon</speaker><content>What conclusions can we draw from the incredible number of stars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>That the movie's either gonna be really good or really bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Mr Damon</speaker><content>I was thinking more about the implications for extraterrestrial life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Well, I guess if there's an infinite number of stars, odds are there's at least one galaxy with life other than our own</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Mr Damon</speaker><content>Or</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Or... not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> The question then becomes, "could you possibly teach us anything more useless?"  What are you looking at?  Nick: Abby?  Oh, my God. Something's wrong. She's not breathing. Abby?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Would you mind at least putting a napkin under your jelly toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get a table, and I won't eat it on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Yes, you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But I won't have a good excuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why don't you go get a table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not my condo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have my permission. Pick out whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then it would be a reflection of me, not you. That wouldn't be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> No, it would be a reflection of the fact that the guy who's been mooching off of me for as long as I can remember, isn't a complete ingrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You've never furnished a home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I have furnished a bunch of homes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you've married a bunch of women, who furnished a bunch of homes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want to eat off something? Fine. Move your piano in here and eat off that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Of a dining table? You know, they don't actually come to life when you put a knob off your bedpost on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are what you sit in. Your friends, your job, your furnishings — it all defines you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You don't really believe that. You just don't want to do the shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Buy some furniture, or admit that you're empty inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>X-rays confirm the fluid that almost suffocated her to death was from pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Means the problem's either in her heart or lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Tox screen's clean for everything except the alcohol, and her B.A.C. was barely .05.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That means she only had one or two drinks, tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And there's no sign of trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't have needed me to take the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How do you know Cuddy…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman's the only one with the balls to take a case without checking with me, and he's still working on breakfast. Which means that the...  18... no, 17-year-old honor student —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cuddy has a soft spot for smart girls, and they don't start drinking until second semester, senior year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So either you think that smart women look out for each other, which means you're an idiot, or you think Cuddy's not smart, which means... well, I guess it's the same both ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Then how did you —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Picture fell out of the file. She looks smart. Where's Taub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You don't already know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife. I'm just curious what he wanted me to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His car has a flat tire. He's waiting for a tow truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about rising blood pressure from binge drinking? It could set off a hypertensive crisis, cause heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Two drinks is hardly a binge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Certainly not if you're an Aussie. But when an American schoolgirl has two drinks before 10:00 am, it's a pretty sure bet that the plan is to have a lot more. Probably wasn't the first time she had that plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We'll get a C-13-pyruvate MRI to check for cardiac lactic-acid levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone call Taub. Tell him to cut the ball and chain on his own time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're arguing about couples yoga?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. We're arguing over the fact that we don't ever do anything together anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We don't ever do anything together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chris, I love you, but I swear, if you start talking to me like I'm on the witness stand again, I'm gonna break your neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Honey, we do stuff together all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? Like what? Besides sleeping, watching tv, going out to dinner, what do we do together, just the two of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We... You don't like going out to dinner? All right, I'll do the yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Now you don't want me to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just go to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. I'm not leaving until we work this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm fine. Please, just go.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Where's Abby Nash? I'm Nick, her boyfriend.  This is my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Artie</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You can wait in —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Where is she? Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's having some tests run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> We think her drinking may have damaged her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Her heart? No, she doesn't drink, not that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just when she's at school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Artie</speaker><content>Nick, what's he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>It was a field trip. One of the kids had a fake I.D. But dad, you know Abby. Tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Artie</speaker><content>Well, I know what she's like when the two of you are around me, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you're right, the tests will come back negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Can you give her a message? I brought her homework... and I love her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry I'm late.  Nick loves you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House doesn't believe you got a flat tire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What does he think I was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fighting with the wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why would I lie about that?  She wants me to do yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> We need thinner cuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>When you and Cameron had disagreements —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm probably not, the best guy to go to for marital advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Sorry. It's just —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Punch in to the mitral valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>All right, I get the message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> No — no, I'm serious. What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Could be a fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>E.R. drew blood cultures — all negative, no parasites, no fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It could be fastidious enteric bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think she's been eating your wife's cooking? Hey, I'm on your side, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I am not fighting with my wife. I had a flat tire. It's in my trunk. You can go look at it if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't need to. Face tells me you're bluffing.  Not yours — Chase's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If she was infected through the intestinal tract, she'd have intestinal symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>There are other ways to get enteric bacteria into the bloodstream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's not an intravenous drug user, she has no tattoos, and she doesn't have any scars that would indicate she's a cutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Transesophageal Echo could give us a better idea of what we're looking at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If that valve is about to dehisce, echo could trigger a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So come up with a better idea or have a crash cart ready.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why are you lying to House? Chase told me. What's the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Maybe we can talk about this another time... or never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I really don't think she's gonna tell anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If I admit we're fighting, he's gonna want to know what about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So tell him, or tell him it's none of his business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Really? Because it seems much harder. What do I know? I'm not a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes... If only I could be as open about my emotional life as you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It's not about the yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Really? I thought it was, since we spent an hour talking about yoga, but what do I know? I'm not a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>My guess is she thinks you don't want to spend time with her because you're spending it with someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If she thinks I'm cheating, she would ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Because you'd tell the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not seeing anyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Doesn't matter. You have a history. And that's not her fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So what am I supposed to do? I can't prove a negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>That is a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>There's the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Valves look fine — no vegetations, no myxomatous changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Can you give her a little more sedative?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She's dissecting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's rupturing. Get the scope out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Aah!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>This doesn't make sense. Her B.P. is normal, and her heart rate was controlled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We'll figure it out later. We've only got about 30 seconds to get her open.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No leakage from cannulation site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Let's see if she'll start up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Cardiac paddle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Charging.  And go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pushing five ccs adrenaline.  Zap her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not working. Clear.  Clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Normal sinus rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>T.E.E. and intra-operative visualization showed no vegetations on the valves, no structural abnormalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The dissection means we were wrong about alcohol causing a hypertensive crisis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And by "we" you mean "you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. You were the one who didn't have any better ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not my fault. I was busy trying to judge Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Since we already ruled out trauma, the dissection's probably a genetic defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're running the tests. She's not marfanoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What about an allergy? A severe enough one could set off a systemic immune reaction, cause fluid in the lungs, and inflammation that could weaken the aorta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If it was an allergy, she'd be getting better in the hospital, not worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Unless it was inside her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Meaning?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>You want my sperm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We think a severe allergic reaction could be causing systemic breakdown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Artie</speaker><content>To my son's sperm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Actually, his semen is more likely the problem, which, I realize is not what you were reacting to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When's the last time the two of you had unprotected sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>Never. I use a condom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You always use a condom... For everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content> Well, for most everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Nick</speaker><content>The night before she collapsed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm placing a drop of Nick's semen protein onto the skin. Then I'll abrade it with a needle, check for a rash in an hour or so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Mom, come on... we've been dating for three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>June</speaker><content>Look, I'm not mad, sweetheart. I'm just, confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A systemic reaction can be triggered by the protein in semen. In most cases, the reaction is fairly minor. But in rare cases, repeat exposure can trigger a hypersensitivity response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>June</speaker><content>Repeat exposure? Ugh, I know, I know — three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Is it supposed to hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The reaction should take longer than...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>No, it's not that. Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Abby, what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>My stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blood in the urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Help me! Aah!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No allergic reaction. On the other hand, now her kidneys are failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Could be some kind of neuropathy. Syphilitic lightning pains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not syphilis. VDRL and enzyme immunoassays were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What about a blood clot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Interstitial nephritis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But cancer could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you care to be a little more specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If I could, I would have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could do a full-body scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We hate full-body scans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And by "we" you mean "you." We also hate when a patient dies before we figure out what's wrong with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do the scan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How can you convince someone you're not cheating on them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't cheat. After a while, they'll catch on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What if I don't want to wait that long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Take them with you wherever you go for 24 hours a day. So your wife's a little insecure. Is that so bad? At least you know she still cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know she cares. What I want is, for her to be happy.  What? You don't think I want my wife to be happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sure... As long as it makes you happy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think you work quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Piece of cake, you give them money, they give you furniture. Not bad, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. It's not “bad” at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>It's taking a really long time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A vascular problem could explain both. Inflammation in the blood-vessel walls leads to dissection in the aorta and could cause an aneurysm in the brain that could cause the visions.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If I say her blood pressure shot up over 200 and she bit her tongue, would that be a satisfactory answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. If you then went on to answer the following — Did she float above her body? Did she see Jesus? Did she bathe in the Ganges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, no, and no. Can we get back to the medical science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She claims she emerged from her body as a younger version of herself and started talking. She couldn't remember what was discussed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But I'm sure it wasn't a differential. House, cognitive pattern recognition is 50 years from being a useful diagnostic tool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Even if we can get the equipment, it takes hours for the initial mapping. If she has another seizure, she could stroke out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not magical. It's experimental. Just like washing your hands after pooping once was. And technically, it's not our best shot. I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfect. So, Foreman, go get her consent. The rest of you go down to the cog sci lab. Equipment should already be there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Liver's responsible for proteins, immunological effects, production of red blood cells. Might be able to explain the lungs, the hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not the aortic dissection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidneys are also failing. We add in polycystic disease, could explain the dissection.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Artie</speaker><content>But you just said —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's cool. My theory is that her body was able to kill off the parasite, but what it couldn't do was get rid of the shell, which doesn't show up on the scans.
