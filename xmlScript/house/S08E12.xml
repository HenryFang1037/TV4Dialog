<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cindy</speaker><content>Don't we need to get you to a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I am a doctor. That didn't come up last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cindy</speaker><content>We didn't do a lot of talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cindy</speaker><content>You never told me what caused your accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was stabbed by a patient. That'll teach me to overbill.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>45 year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures. No metabolic or structural…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Does this look like a good time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sort of. At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you. Kinda like now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.  You do work for me. I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't know when I'm coming back. I don't know if I'm coming back. Got a problem with that, fire me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Therapist</speaker><content> Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Believe me, I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Arrhythmias are gone. Fine motor control is improving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not what I meant. If you need to talk to someone, a professional…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine enough to get back to work? You don't have to work for House, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Buys you whatever you need. But I know you. If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it, you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Uh, have this terrible pain in my left shoulder. It came out of nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sister Joan</speaker><content>And nothing seems to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Any other symptoms? Chest pain? Lightheadedness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>No. None at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What were you doing when the pain came on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Just sitting and praying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sister Joan</speaker><content>She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning, but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A couple of possibilities. You have enlarged lymph nodes, so I'd like to start by ruling out breast cancer. And I do mean "rule out." It's probably nothing.  I'm gonna do a quick breast exam. Do you mind stepping out for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sister Joan</speaker><content>Not at all. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> That was so I could ask about the second possibility. Left-sided pain means it could be angina, which is made worse by stress. Might not be a coincidence that the pain started on the verge of a major life change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blue Veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet. Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.  You're about to withdraw from the world for good. I was a seminarian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Who obviously didn't take his vows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Cassock made my ass look fat.  Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Okay. I have had second thoughts. I'm kind of a wreck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A life of perpetual enclosure and almost complete silence? If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm going to admit you. There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's just a benign fat deposit. Her imaging's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stress test too. It's not angina. So why the shoulder pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Thanks a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn't tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You were cagey about where you were going. And Chase being cagey in general. Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage. So I had Park follow you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content> How you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Better. Heard your arm's healing nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Good to see you on your feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Patient's a nun? You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She was next up in the clinic.  And I don't want your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got stabbed. You blame me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or maybe the reverse is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Thanks for all your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads. Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thanks for all my help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>I'm… I'm sorry I led House to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's part of the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight, if you want some companionship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You asking me out on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content>No. I just… I guess that sounded… must be scary to be back. All those knives and needles. Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look. Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just knowing you're there for me is enough. Thanks. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Ever surf Kirra Point? Obviously you're Australian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I've surfed all over the Gold Coast. Don't tell me you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>The closest I got was Waimea Bay. I grew up on Maui.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you don't mind me asking, why are you becoming a nun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>You asking 'cause I surf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but…  Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you. What were you doing before this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Not much of anything. Worked as a nanny. Moved around a lot. Bunch of failed relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And then what? God spoke to you? You heard the calling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Something like that. Does there have to be some dramatic moment where the skies part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Usually, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mom drank, dad worked. They stuck me in catholic school. Priests and nuns were the closest I had to family. Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Is that why you left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> I think, I may throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>What's wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not a fungal infection.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I'll tell you. You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle. Taub has decided…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I need help with my patient. She's vomiting. That's not from a fungal infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I have no idea. Almost dying's been clarifying. I can do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can do anything. So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years. Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Can we get to my patient sometime soon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You'll help me. 'Cause even though you don't find my case interesting, you find my interest in it interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, when you put it that way… Ascending colangitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Missed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Can't be, bilirubin's normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Ha ha ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is great. We should make this a regular thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>She can't feel her foot at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>What does this mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Ketosteroid levels are low. How can he be hyper-sexual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer. You think his sexuality is normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I need more help. My patient has a new symptom. Ischemic foot. Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me start with an allegory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Park</speaker><content> Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay, I'm curious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me. Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Krav Maga. Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the seventh? And the eighth? And the Nth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If you get him, what's that gonna prove?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That unexpected things happen. By definition, no class can teach you to expect them. Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Blood clot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her D-dimer's normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>What if he's right about the blockage but wrong about the cause? Vasospasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That explains everything but the lymph nodes. And any minor infection</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Calcium channel blocker to treat. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room. I could feel better about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>You saved my life too. I think the ledger's clear. But how can you not be traumatized?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Can't change what happened. Can only make better choices from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>So you're Zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House? I'm seeing a trauma counselor. I think you should too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm okay. Just knowing you're there for me is enough. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Convent lets you have this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I borrowed it from one of the nurses. I'm still on temporary vows. It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're using an iPod. But I've never seen you use rosary beads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What day did Jesus die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I know, one gospel says Passover; another says the day before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial? Once or twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>You can't argue away my faith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why? Because it's so strong even plain contradictions…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> Because it's not that strong. I'm not saying I don't have faith. I just haven't felt the calling yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No one joins the clergy without having that epiphany. That God's love is speaking to you directly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>It's the silence, the contemplation, the order. I need them. Hoping everything else will come later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's not an answer. If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I tried the outside world. It wasn't enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ever been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No kids. You never found a career. Doesn't sound like the outside world got much of a try. What you're headed towards now, 14 hours a day in silent prayer, never having a family, never touching another human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Just because that's what you'd miss the most. The nurses talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Nothing's wrong with having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>They said you were almost killed three weeks ago. You go right back to fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is that why you wanna be a nun? Someone broke your heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>No. I'm just looking for something more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm late for work in the clinic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Really? George Washingbaum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was a character in the Flintsteins. Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not as much as House's surprise attacks. He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too. Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team. He's annoying, he's maddening, but he makes us all better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Note to self.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Foot color's good. Arterial pulse is good. Capillary refill's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sister Joan</speaker><content>And her shoulder pain’s all gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Looks like your ready to go…home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sister Joan</speaker><content>I’ll get the car and meet you out front. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’d say I’m in the book but not the one you’ll be reading from now on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Six years ago I…was a nanny in Honolulu.  For this beautiful two-year old boy. I loved him, probably spent more time with him than his own parents. One day I was in the park talking with another nanny. He wandered out of the sandbox, into the street, into the path of a moving car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That could have happened to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I don't think so. And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You shouldn't.  You shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I'm running to God. After what happened to you, don't you wanna remake your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not by hiding myself away. I hope it works out for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> It is gonna be hard. Not touching anyone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie. No wonder you're playing handsies with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> You think I'm hitting on a nun? Angry at God or I just need a challenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut. But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft. Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option. That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not emotionally involved with her. And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me, I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues at La Scala. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Leisha</speaker><content>I'm talking to this agent. He's a bit of a sleaze. But he's really excited about representing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Leisha</speaker><content>Although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get me an audition for one of those online soaps. Have you ever watched one of those?  Am I boring you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Unfortunately, yeah. Sorry. </content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're not supposed to be here. Or anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> You were right. I was running away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oh, now you're shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>It's brighter in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So, are we gonna spend the rest of eternity in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons poke at us with sticks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>This is a little scary for me. I had a whole life planned. Not that I wasn't struggling with it. And then I met you. Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not, not the relationship type. I was married once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> Relax. You're fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> So what's next for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I have to find a place to live. Get my old job back. Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>As long as you keep dealing with your doubts in the same way then… Moira?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>sorry, did you say something?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up. Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game. You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile. You sure you want…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Taub is interrogating the janitor. He must think that I hired him to attack… actually, why didn't I do that? Plaques could be confused for nodules. Which would mean…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>While I was on the operating table, it didn't feel like a dream. I saw the boy who I was caring for. The one who died. He walked right up to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>He just held my hand. It was like he forgave me. Do you think that's crazy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> I took that scalpel for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>That's why I did this. Three weeks ago, you never would have slept with a patient. And you never would have operated on her after. You need help.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is, not surprisingly, wrong. Abdominal ultrasound was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Adams</speaker><content>Then we have to assume liver failure is just another symptom of whatever she's got.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content> Why didn't you tell me that before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because it was so shallow. I wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Moira</speaker><content>I don't believe that. You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife, not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.</content></utterance>
