<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Karen</speaker><content>Amber’s a stripper name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ethan</speaker><content>Find me one stripper named Amber Hartig.  Or not, okay. Non-stripper names, okay.  Desiree? Bambi? Candy cane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Karen</speaker><content>Max. Maxine. Max Hartig is a cute name, isn’t it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Karen</speaker><content>Can you believe we made this little creature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ethan</speaker><content>I know, it’s incredible.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content> You lived underwater for nine months, you’d have a lot to spit up, too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Karen</speaker><content>Is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>Eh, a little lethargic.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Soap doctor</speaker><content>It’s what we expected. The accident caused serious damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s amnesia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Soap doctor</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Soap patient</speaker><content>I just can’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>Enjoying our lounge, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just came in to get milk for my coffee, which you’re out of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Flat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content> Sparkling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Kubisak</speaker><content>So, the Hartigs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>Their baby gets a fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kubisak</speaker><content>Wait, don’t tell me. Their kid had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>Yep. The parents, of course, start freaking and I have to deal with that for an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kubisak</speaker><content>Like it was your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>She was perfect when I delivered her. If you want to blame someone, blame the pediatrician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kubisak</speaker><content>So, how’s the kid now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Lim</speaker><content>Bowel obstruction, she’s under observation, she’ll be fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Kubisak</speaker><content>Pediatrician’ll take all the credit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Exhibit A: Baby girl Hartig. Term baby, 42 hours old. Went into seizures 6 hours ago, brought into the intensive care, diagnosed with obstruction of the small bowel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m still amazed you’re in the same room with a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People don’t bug me until they get teeth.  Exhibit B: Baby boy Hausen. Another term baby, 48 hours old. Brought into the NICU before the Hartig baby: fever of unknown origin, 101 degrees, trending upwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wow, that is amazing. You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge and heard about two sick babies. It’s eerie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t touch that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> All right…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have an infection spreading in the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They fell sick within four hours of each other. They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission’s possible. They have the same symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction. No matter how close their beds are, I’m pretty sure kids can’t share a blockage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well, normally, I’d say it indicates a patient’s bowel is obstructed, but I’m pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the patient’s bowel is obstructed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay, you’re upset because they threw you out of their lounge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look at the x-ray. It’s a normal gas pattern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Air. Air in the colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’re getting TiVo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it’s air, no bowel obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Something’s infected both these infants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you’re the only one who put this together because…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I’m the only one who looked at both kids. I want them isolated; I want the maternity ward shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because you’re better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Radiologists always over-read babies’ x-rays, especially if they’re asked to rule out a pathology. He read into it what he wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Which is exactly what you’re doing. You’re finding a cluster because you think it’s interesting to find a cluster. Two… plain old sick babies would bore you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See, this is why I don’t waste money on shrinks, ‘cause you give me all these really great insights for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself. The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God’s sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have an epidemic! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Two sick babies is very sad, but it doesn’t prove an epidemic. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get up! We’re going hunting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wabbits.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi.  Bye.  He’s screaming, he’s fine.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, wrong room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> We’ll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> 12 rooms, that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Yep. We’ve definitely checked the whole floor.  Good news, no epidemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tragic, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Overflow rooms, third floor. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> This imaginary infection has spread to the next floor?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>We were just going to call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did he get hot all of a sudden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Excuse me! Hi. Intake sent you up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, my wife’s contractions are less than –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah, Intake messed up. I’m very, very sorry. Nurse Alpret will arrange for an ambulance to take you to Princeton General. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Wha –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The maternity ward is temporarily closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>We have to leave?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, I am very sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Why are you doing this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’ll be there very, very soon.  Happy now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But I am interested.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Spiking fevers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP’s plummeting. They’re barely able to keep systolic up; at this rate, they’ll be dead in a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Where did this come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Two delivery rooms, four different maternity rooms, no common personnel and no common equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, there’s gotta be something in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m putting a team together. We’re going to start swabbing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s she gonna swab? Every respirator, sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital? That’ll take months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A needle in a haystack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s worse than that. We don’t even know what’s the needle we’re looking for. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then why’d you let her go do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because the hospital’s her baby, and her baby’s sick. If she doesn’t solve this soon, her head’s going to explode, and I don’t want to get any on me.  So let’s figure out what’s in the haystack. Differential diagnosis, people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Parasite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Spreading too quickly. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Virus? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kids are too sick, and the blood tests show no lymphocytosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And they’re not responding to a cycle of avirarapovirin. If it’s some other virus, we’ll never find it in time, anyway. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which leads us to bacterial infection.  It’s not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we’ve got something resistant. The usual suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>MRSA. It’s always MRSA in hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe a contaminated food or water source? Psuedomonas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>VRE?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>H-Flu. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, those are the big ones. Cultures will take 48 hours, might as well be post-mortem. We’ll start them on Vancomycin for the MRSA and Aztreonam for the rest. Let’s get MRIs, check for abcesses or some occult infection. I’ll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find something important. Or unimportant.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> We did a MRI on all the babies, and unfortunately, we didn’t find anything, so we’re starting him on the strongest antibiotics we’ve got, and we’re hoping that that’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>But he’s so tiny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>How sick is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> His fever’s up to 103.5 and his blood pressures 80 over 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Um, how bad is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Ah, it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> It, it’s low. The heart needs to circulate the blood. If it’s weak, oxygen isn’t getting to the liver, the kidneys, the brain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Um, I have to ask you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Judy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>No, no, Kim. Let me. Um, I had a cold last month, and I told the doctors about it, and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Honey, this has nothing to do with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kim’s right. Your son was born healthy. He caught the infection after his birth. There’s no reason to think he got it from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>But you don’t know, I mean – You don’t know how he got sick. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pretty standard question: how sick is my child? You couldn’t answer it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I answered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You rattled off numbers! BP, O2 stats.… That’s not what they need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What they need to know is the future. Got a magic 8-ball? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, just eight years of medical training. Look, I realize it’s tough to break bad news to family –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not as tough as hearing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And I guess being the poor guy dying is toughest of all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> No. It’s easier to die than to watch someone die. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, we’re checking the vents, it could be airborne. Somebody get the sinks, too, and underneath them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Med Student with the Tie</speaker><content>I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How many med students have you got swabbing the decks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, what else are they going to do? It’s not like they’re delivering babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Find anything yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ah, yeah. About half the antibacterial gel dispensers are empty or broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That’s bad. And diagnostically, completely insignificant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, if the staff can’t wash their hands, it’s no wonder an infection has spread.  Hey, tie clip!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Med Student with the Tie</speaker><content>Sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a Petri dish. Put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lift up your arms.  You have a parasite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Like a tapeworm or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lie back and lift up your sweater.  You can put your arms down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Can you do anything about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Illegal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Playdates…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It has your eyes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>But… that’s impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I assume you weren’t getting your period. Maybe that should have give you an inkling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>But I’m on this birth control implant…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>…and my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mm hmm. Interestingly enough, you also don’t get any periods if it isn’t working, which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests.  I’m going to send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care. You’re due in about five months, so start planning the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Um, Doctor? Please. Me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon, but… oh, God. Like four months ago we had this really big fight.  He moved out. I did something stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One-night stand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Ex-boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll schedule you a paternity test, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>I can’t let my husband know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content> Yeah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then just have the kid. He’ll never know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You’re off to a great start. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you look cheery. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies. Their kidneys are shutting down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And the urine tests show no casts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re the nephrologist. Which one did it? We’ll take ‘em off that one.  Don’t tell me both Vancomycin and Aztreonam can –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They both can cause this. There’s no way to know which one it is. No test. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We can’t take them off the antibiotics. They’ll die of the infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If we leave them on both the antibiotics they’ll die of kidney failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So, we take our best guess, then. Which drug’s causing the kidney failure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s like I said: it’s always MRSA in hospitals. Take ‘em off Aztreonam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I still think it’s the pseudomonas. I vote to take them off the Vancomycin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s no point in guessing. Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.</content></utterance>

Well, generally I’d applaud that, but my job is to protect this hospital, so I strongly advice you to come up with a medical rationale why Baby A should get Medicine X and vice-versa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick. We didn’t all go to law school. Your advice is that I should use medical reasons to make medical decisions? Hmm, that’s not going to be as easy…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not about trivialities.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sometimes the best gift is the gift of never seeing you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Okay, all right! But, Dr. House, you’ve been so awesome. I mean, I really, totally trust you. Do you think you –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s no wonder. You’ve had a hard time the last couple of days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And you haven’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not like you.  Anyone who’s that awkward either has no experience around death or too much, and I’m pretty sure it’s not the former.  Chase told me about that idea you had: the parents holding the baby. Where’d you get that? Did you lose someone? Did you lose a baby?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enteroviruses are spread by humans. Fecal, oral… could be respiratory secretions, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So, Cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff. Just wait until they come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That won’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The shedder, whoever he is, is so virulent, Cuddy must have noticed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the babies didn’t share any common personnel. That’s what’s weird.</content></utterance>
