<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Reverend Bowden</speaker><content>That's what I like to hear. Do you, Theodore Philip Taylor, take Nicole Margaret Murray to be your wife, and promise before God and these witnesses to be her loving and faithful husband, in plenty and in want, in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hardly. One of my P.A.s quit an hour ago, and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Nurse Jeffrey</speaker><content>Any bed you're in is the wrong one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That’s not what your mama said.  Oh! Snap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Nurse Jeffrey</speaker><content>I'll be going now.  To Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He started it. It was the neighbor's kid's bed. Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About yea drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you okay? You shouldn't be drinking at all, much less—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sound just like Esteban's mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need you in the clinic.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sounds interesting. I'll take it.  I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I really do have a case.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You guys know how to honeymoon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is Dr. House.  Aphasia and syncope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>He can't speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>"Aphasia" is Greek for loss of voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We've ruled out infection, vocal cord damage, and stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> A lot of guys syncope at the altar. It's Greek for "having the vapors."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We ruled out all the common causes of fainting: Low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't say "ah."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Do you know what it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Roll on your side and lift up your gown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's one thing they didn't test for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>A test for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Test was positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content> I— I can— I can talk. I— I wasn't faking. My voice just came back right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>I know he wasn't faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about the syncope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, the— </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is she buying this too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Why would he fake anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Kryo podia. It's Greek for "duh."  Still, you get to keep the engagement ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't think he was faking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's because you're more gullible than I am.  For instance, I don't believe that you called off your open marriage. I believe your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off. A guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's exactly why you dabble. You're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not that predictable. For example, you're probably not expecting me to ask you out for dinner tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You won't even consider it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did, just very quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night. If I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. If you bring your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No. That's the point. I need a little—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'm not lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then I'm not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay. Fontina at 8:30.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>You believe me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Of course I believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Then let's do it. We'll tell a cab to take us to AC right now and get it done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>You're serious? You just walked out of the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Exactly. I walked out. I feel great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Well, we do have the clothes for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Ted, what's wrong? Are you— what's wrong? Oh, my God. Can somebody help us?  Please! Please hurry. Just breathe. Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding. A Tweet, for example.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Pleural effusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You think his lung is faking it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's at least 200 ccs of fluid in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Okay, let's say all his symptoms are real. Explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words "virgin" or "Mary."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If the pleural effusion's caused by something systemic, it could explain his other two symptoms. And so whether you believe him or not, all we have to figure out is what caused the PE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A medication he's not telling us about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You really don't trust this guy, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't even trust the ER. Let's rule out infections ourselves. Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We already—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This time, talk about nuptials while you do it. Check his home for everything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He just moved in with his fiancee three months ago. Toxic exposure could take longer than that to manifest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You check his love nest.  You two check his swinging bachelor pad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That somebody else now lives in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I assume so.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not the glass. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The place looks like...1960s? Could have lead paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You think a 27-year-old has pica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If it gets us out of here before the owner comes back, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What'd you tell that cute physio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> That I changed my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No, you didn't. You're more nervous than usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Because this B and E has actual B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> That's a suspended ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I want to see what's above it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>More ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Asbestosis. I like it. I'll be in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content> What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh, it's okay. We're doctors. Nobody was home, so—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content> Well, I'm calling the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Do you know Ted Taylor? He used to live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>Yeah. What about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He's our patient at Princeton Plainsboro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We think he may have asbestosis from your ceiling tiles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>They're not asbestos. I had 'em checked when I moved in. How sick is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is he a friend of yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>He was. Actually, he was my boyfriend for three years.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I'm not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Really? 'Cause it would certainly explain the cold feet. Oh, and the boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So you're bisexual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>No, I'm straight. Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay. He had a crush on me. I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>After three years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, it's possible. It doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>We weren't sleeping together. What's this got to do with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Lung tap turned up mononucleosis. ER doesn't routinely test for it. It explains the PE and can be virtually asymptomatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono? You're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If there's been any unprotected sex, we'll need to test for HIV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>There's been no sex of any kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. I'll go test your fiancee for HIV. Is she the curious sort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Wait. There may have been some  contact, but I'm not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sodomy, one of the top ten most common household accidents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I did a lot of stupid things, but I turned my life around. I'm as straight as any of you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>You don't have to believe me. I'm just saying you can test me... As long as you don't tell Nicole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What business is it of hers? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't see anything wrong with him marrying a straight woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>How about, it'll make them both miserable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just like most straight marriages. He's got the right to life, liberty, and unhappiness, like the rest of us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Absolutely no reason to look at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not saying it's a great choice. Just saying it's his choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It has to be hers as well, which it can't be as long as she doesn't know he's gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which is how it's gonna stay since we have no right to tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Like you've never bent the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You date guys. You date girls. I assume at some point, you're gonna make a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I don't lie about who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Patients lying never bothered you before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patients weren't lying about their sexual orientation before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So you're only judgmental when it gets personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Does it bother me that people hurt others because they're too weak to face the truth? Yeah. Sorry about that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tell me she's not looking at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's negative?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yep. Looks like being gay didn't make him sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>So maybe being straight did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The test was negative. No HIV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>What you didn't tell us is how you turned your life around. It can be pretty hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>It was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Downright impossible on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I talked to some people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It was more than just talk, wasn't it? I know this is personal stuff. I'm here to help you, not out you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I had therapy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Conversion therapy. Went to a camp for three weeks of intensive rehabilitation. They injected him with emetics while he watched gay porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Apomorphine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Or lithium chloride or cyclophosphamide. He doesn't know. And when that didn't work, they shot him up with male hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>A chemical assault like that could explain the PE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And the ECT explains the rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>To zap the fabulous right out of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Neural damage accounts for the aphasia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>ECT doesn't cause neural damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-man quackery camp. Run an EEG. See if they straightened him or just scrambled him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Sorry. I completely forgot. My wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00. It's a half-hour drive from here.

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I think you're still seeing the physio.  You've got a backup suit in your car. Don't want to be bringing home da stank.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, Dr. House. I didn't know you'd be here.  Hi, honey. Got your text, obviously.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>An EEG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>What's it for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We're looking for neurological damage that could have caused his symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Damage from what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>A head trauma.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Four ways to stop a heart.  Electrical problems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think that's three things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> And cheating.  Oh, no. Sorry. That's how you break a heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full so my wife couldn't join me.  EP study ruled out shocks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eyes so she could see the concern in yours. Why are you setting me up on dates with my team?  Taub asking me out was quirky, but Thirteen doing it is a barking cat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave him a dollar. How much did you have to pay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Nothing. I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company.  100 bucks, Foreman held out for 2.  House, I'm worried about you. You could have ended up in jail or worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Racking you with guilt. So I do something really stupid and you reward me. Read any parenting manual. That's not helping me. That's helping you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fine, I did it for me, for my relationship, out of pure self-interest.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>No! I thought, I was. I even, made up my mind to tell my family. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, psyching myself up. All I could see was disgust. And that's when I realized, I didn't hate the thought of admitting I was gay because I was ashamed. I hated the thought because I wasn't gay. And that was the day I went to get help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>So you're not gay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>They cured me, Nicole. That's what all the head trauma is about. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it's— it's all in the past now. It doesn't matter anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. What about infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That's what we're thinking. Cerebral infection would explain the headaches, could have caused P.O.T.S. If it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was talking about you. Has the little gent been wearing a tent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Remind me why that has anything to do with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A distracted person makes a distracted professional.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably. Do a spinal tap. Run the CSF.  Still talking about you.  But you can do it on the patient, too, if you want. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>The guy walked in with his bride. It took me a while to rotate my dish. It's unbelievable what he's doing to her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too, but it's hardly the same. To be faithful to his wife, our patient has to deny his identity. Taub just needs to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> to resist a biological imperative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>It is easier to say no to dessert than to pretend you don't eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Says someone who's obviously never been on a diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're successful, smart, and you attract everything that moves. If you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You know what? I agree with you. My self-pity's optional. What about yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>CSF was negative for infection, and his headaches are worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We were just talking about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Please don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not P.O.T.S., we're back to square one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not quite. You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're maxing him out on morphine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He sprung a leak. He's losing CSF from the tap site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We made his headaches worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just you, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S., not the other way around. Patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There. That should stop the leak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You should be feeling some relief soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>I spoke to my parents.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Call the boyfriend. Let's get them all in the same room.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Or because it's vascular. I know we did an MRA, but arterial disease causing acute ischemia could explain the heart, neuro symptoms, and maybe even P.O.T.S.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I feel terrible. I-I don't think anything's gonna work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Medically, that's good news.  Are you feeling feverish? You're sweating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>No. I feel lousy, but I don't know why I'm sweating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're not sweating.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> His therapists loaded him with hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Male hormones don't make you lactate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Except they could screw up your thyroid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That was over three months ago. We just started milking him last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So something else screwed up his thyroid. Graves, Hashimoto's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. TSH was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pituitary tumor. Could also explain his libido and heart issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And if the tumor's big enough, his headaches and syncope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Except we— we cleared him for cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Didn't say "cancer." Prolactinomas can be benign.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You believe Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I believe Foreman. And they had fun with you. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I realized that they could be my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And then I sobered up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You weren't that drunk. You managed to find your way into your own little bed last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you want to blame this on the booze, but that's easy. Change is hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And wisdom is knowing the difference between what you can change...  And what you were born with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And cowardice is labeling what you don't want to change as innate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I was winning this argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Pituitary MRI—</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Give me your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Oh, wow, that— that's better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Okay, enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How cool is that? You have a Chiari malformation, a narrowing in the base of your skull that can cut off CSF flow. But it wasn't a problem until the ECT at breeder boot camp caused your brain to swell just enough to plug the opening. And when your brain pressed up against your pituitary, it signed you up for La Leche League. You still won't be pitching a tent for your lady, but that's just because, you know, she's a lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Its orthostatic effect was mimicking P.O.T.S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It also does an uncanny Christopher Walken. Unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S., it gets worse. So, as far as that goes, oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Proper treatment is surgery. We'll get you in right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>So how did I get this thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Overbearing mother. Kidding. CM's congenital. Like so many other things, you were born that way.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>Ted, this is a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I know you're hurting, and I'm sorry, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Cotter</speaker><content>I'm talking about hurting her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I love her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Less than a week ago we were standing at the altar, perfectly happy. Nothing's changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>I still love you. Do you still love me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>Yes. But—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Then that's all that matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>But I think that you still love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content> I'm not gay. Nicole, I promise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content>How can you promise me that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Because I believe that we get to choose how we live our lives, and I've made my choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content> So now, I have to make mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>Ted</speaker><content>Nic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>Nicole</speaker><content> I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
