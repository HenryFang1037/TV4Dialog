<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chris</speaker><content>That was freakin' awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chris</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chris</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content> What? Oh, man… Is that guy dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chris</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Think House is coming in today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe if we start offering spa treatments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He already jumped off of a hotel balcony. Who knows what he'll do next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ride some kind of prostitute chariot to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First person to offer me an interesting case gets to ride her… single or double-team.  My scooter, which, now said out loud, sounds even more inappropriate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Seriously? You're bringing them to work now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>23-year-old homeless man brought into the E.R. with burn injuries and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me guess… diagnosis was fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He said his burning flesh smelled like licorice, and the E.R. antiseptics like blueberry muffins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool. Dysosmia… could be anything from an environmental factor to an early sign of a degenerative brain disease.  Smells like a winner. Okay,  you and Chase go check out the park where they found him.  You two load him up with Prednisone, give him an odor I.D. test. If he's still mistaking his body odors for candy, the problem's definitely in his brain. Also, find out what else he's lying about…  Since I'm assuming "Ferris Bueller" is not his real name. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Seriously, who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>They say he's a righteous dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Before I forget, I want you to meet Dominika. She's about to become a permanent member of Team House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Nice to be meetings you all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Doing what exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Me. We're getting married on Friday.  Mount up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I don't think that two people are supposed…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Living on the edge, baby doll!</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How's the arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Hmm? It hurts. Do I have to check out now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Not until we figure out why your sense of smell is off. When was the first time you noticed it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Maybe a couple months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We also need you to tell us your real name, so we can review your medical records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I didn't ask to come here, okay? I'm not paying for any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't worry. I don't think the collection agency has an office in the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I don't have a medical history. I've always been healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about those scars and burn marks?  Lean forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>My dad… We didn't exactly get along when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>How many times were you hospitalized?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Never. He was good at it. Made sure he never did anything that couldn't be covered up by a sweatshirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>No, don't be. I'm not. The past is the past. That's why I don't like talking about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You can't ride that thing in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Speaking of things,  I'm having one on Friday. If you want to drop by, we'd love to have you.  No pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're still standing on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I am. Perhaps you're not familiar with New Jersey handicap ordinances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Or perhaps I am. They apply to wheelchairs and powered scooters only, not toys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you any idea how much this toy cost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For some reason, my leg's been hurting a lot this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>For some reason, I still don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine. I'll return it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But I’ll have to walk it out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Stop. I'll make an exception for your leg. But next time, check with me first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Congratulations on your engagement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hear a strange voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>A very soft-looking man. Must be the Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know we said no secrets, but I think I need to take this alone, honey bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Okay.  Nice to be meeting you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're trying to screw with Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it's the classic "You dumped me, so I'm gonna get married a week later" ruse. 'Cause not only is she that stupid, but apparently I'm that stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And what, you're openly mocking marriage… trying to prove it means nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It doesn't. But you proved that yourself years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'd love to keep guessing, but I've got people with tumors waiting. Why do you want us to think that you're getting married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Only one theory left… I am. Dominika needs a green card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you're just doing some random stranger a favor? It's illegal. People go to jail for that… Pay huge fines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Have you seen me practice medicine? You know how much it costs to have a live-in maid, personal assistant, cook, massage therapist, whore? I do. She's willing to work four days a week for free. It's gonna save me about $33,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All I have to do is say two stupid words… "I do."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And if she doesn't see it this way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Iron-clad prenup… We go our separate ways. Your stunned look, I take it, is your way of saying, "Brilliant idea, House."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Wow. You look different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The Prednisone has had time to work, so we need to give you the odor I.D. test now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> We need you to tell us what you smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content> Oh… Something spoiled… Maybe, rotting meat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's baby powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I kind of like that one. Peppermint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's extremely bad body odor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Well, you got to admit, that one's kind of a good deal for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>My backpack. Oh, where'd you find it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>In the park, right next to a big pile of questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> What kind of drugs you shooting up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Vitamin supplements. I've been trying to boost my immune system. All right, test me if you don't believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ferris tell you his real name yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Peter Johnson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Danny Jennings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I bought those books used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>All from the same guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I'm sorry, you know, I think I should check out now.  And I should… Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Oh, my stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Gastrointestinal bleeding.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Is anyone else disturbed by this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What? She offered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Danny may have lied about his name, but he was telling the truth about the vials. Tests confirm they were vitamin A and B12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He also enjoys vitamin H. The kid's a junkie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Tox screens were negative for drug use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His hair wasn't. I had it tested…  'Cause unlike Santa and the Easter Bunny, homeless, non-mentally ill 20-somethings without drug problems don't exist. He was a heavy user sometime in the last five months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wow. That was incredible. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>No, thank you. I like a man with the big, strong, sexy feet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He really puts the "mani" in the "pedi."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If he has a history of snorting heroin, he could have caused the dysosmia himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But we still need to explain the bleeding in his G.I. tract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Vitamin injections could have caused that… Hypervitaminosis A syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So his symptoms aren't connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House, you buying this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not usually. But this guy's been sleeping on a bed of dog poop. I wouldn't be surprised if he's got six different symptoms for six different reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>The bleed could be caused by a G.I. obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat. Give him Tocopherol and zinc supplements for the excess vitamin A. If we're right… he could go homeless tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>And if we're wrong, his intestines could get further distressed, while we ignore the G.I. obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> See what happens when women don't have to serve men to stay in the country? The get all uppity. This is why we invented green cards.  Go X-ray the guy's abdomen, if it'll make you feel all equal. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a favor.  I want to add my fiancee's name to my health insurance a few days early. She wants to get a tooth capped before the big day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I'm not signing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I agree.  I think she looks beautiful the way she is. Oh, no, wait. You're not signing that for moral reasons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're declaring yourself the sole arbiter of true love? 'Cause you covered Taub's wife for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Voydi moya malishka </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wanted me to bribe you, like they do back in the old country.  Tell her what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>This is America… the land of the home and the free of the braves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, I just get teary-eyed every time I hear her say that. She brought you a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Almond kulich… I make with own hands. I-it's delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Almond kulich… How can you say no to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You realize if I do sign this and you don't get legally married, you'll lose your insurance with our carrier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. It's your life.  I wish you both the best with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>North, Miss Teschmacher! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Your blood test was clean, but your hair showed heroin use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I've been clean over three months now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How'd you kick it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I had to die first. I O.D.'d back in November, and they said I was clinically dead for several minutes. It was like God gave me a second chance to do things right this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're saying God cured you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>No. State rehab cured me. But, I should be dead, but I'm not. It has to mean something. I mean, I-I must be here for a reason, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Did you figure out the reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>My goal is to become a doctor one day. I am smart. I mean, I got a scholarship for premed out of high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Chase…  Look.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We found 13 masses spread across the wall of his colon, ranging from two to eight millimeters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It can't be tumors. Edges are too sharp and defined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I thought it might be parasites, but we didn't see any movement between X-ray exposures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And no larvae or eggs were observed in any of his stool samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which is kind of surprising for a homeless junkie living in a park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ex-junkie… Claims he's been clean for over three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>And he's not planning on staying homeless. He's trying to protect his health, which is why he's been taking vitamin supplements. He wants to be a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's just telling you what you want to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Once an addict, always an addict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Can you… please not do that in front of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doubt it. You're the main reason I'm on the stuff. We could be looking at fungal masses hanging off the walls of his colon. Start him on Amphotericin "B" tonight, and in the morning, run a scope up where the sun don't shine, see if you can find any truffles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think we should boycott this wedding on principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I kind of have to go. His fiancee did give me a foot massage. And he invited me to be in his wedding party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>W-what about Chase? He ask him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yep. He's in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You just said you weren't even going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I still have feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What's that?  That's definitely not a fungus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You were bleeding because you had 13 pieces of bone in your digestive tract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We think you have pica, a craving for nonfood items that's caused by a chemical imbalance…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I didn't crave them. I kind of… volunteered to eat them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>W-what? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>There's this great Italian restaurant I like to frequent. And by "restaurant," I mean their dumpster out back. The cook is kind of a friend of mine. He challenges me to eat stuff. Sometimes it's raw squid, or, you know, I have to chew on a chicken bone. But if I do it, then he hooks me up with real food, not just the garbage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Great friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>These fragments could have perforated your colon and killed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You have to promise us you'll stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content> I think there's something wrong with my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Uh, it's like I'm looking at you from the bottom of a well.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>If we add tunnel vision to the dysosmia, we can subtract the bone-induced abdominal bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I thought the dysosmia was from heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He said he never snorted, he just shot up. So that wouldn't have affected his sense of smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And we believe the lying liar why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House… Are you even listening to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll start when you decide what the symptoms are and give me some theories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If we combine the dysosmia with the tunnel vision, the symptoms fit for western equine encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But the patient doesn't… no fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Ow! What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Negative reinforcement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What about Foster Kennedy Syndrome? He could have a meningioma or plasmacytoma. Started by pressing on his olfactory nerves, it affects his sense of smell, and now it's growing and pressing on his optic nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. MRI his head, find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your potential donation…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>…Have an immediate impact on our community. We could extend the hours… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. I just think maybe it would be a better idea to have a tour of the clinic first. It's right this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Uh… We have several patients that are children, and we find that it's important to give them the opportunity to play to make the hospital a less intimidating place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content> M-my dad used to lock me in a closet, and it… and it feels like I can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> We need you to stay still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Give him a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You want him squirming around? We'll have to do it twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I want you to show him a little respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You really think this kid can turn his life around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He believes God gave him a second chance. That kind of belief can be powerful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Masters doesn't surprise me. He plays the fellow med student who dreams of being a doctor and reels her in. But you, falling for his deep connection with God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He has hope. After all he's been through, it kind of makes me root for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We don't even know who he is, except that he lies about who he is. The bit about his abusive father is probably all made up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And he faked the scars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's a punk. Probably got into a lot of fights. And he sucked you in using the dad story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I don't think I'm feeling very well.  I think I'm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's vomiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Should I ask him to stay still while he does that? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He has two dark spots in the parietal cortex. They're not tumors… Maybe some kind of, uh, injury or inborn defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Apparently he was clinically dead for several seconds when he O.D.'d. The dark spots could be brain damage from oxygen starvation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except it's not. I've seen MRI imagery like that in schizophrenics.  Three serving two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But schizophrenia doesn't explain why his blood pressure skyrocketed, and he threw up in the MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Panic attack. He's claustrophobic. He was fine once we let him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The dysosmia and tunnel vision could be hallucinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Except, as was already covered, he was screened for mental illness down in the E.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content> In your head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's "face."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>On your face!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Close enough. The E.R. docs missed it, because he didn't present with major symptoms yet. We're seeing it in its infancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So we treat him, and then what? He becomes just another schizophrenic homeless man wandering the streets… We have to help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'd love to, but I got four million other crazy people ahead of him on my to-do list, along with milk.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You two spent months trying to figure out a way to date and not have it affect your working relationship. Now you need to do the same thing for not dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is serious. Did you know that she's…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me. It's great. I mean, not the dumping part, but the part where she'll now let me do whatever I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you're just trying to punish her? She feels bad, and your only goal is to take advantage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not true. I got plenty of goals.  One of them is a 60-inch flat screen right there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're a lot of things House, but you've never been a sadist. You're pummeling an opponent who isn't fighting back.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I already gave him a second dose of Clozapine. You don't need…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll bet you 50 bucks his favorite sport is hockey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>How could you possibly know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just a hunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>My arm kind of hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I'll talk to the nurse about upping your pain meds.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Oh, my nephew bought it for me… knows I'm a huge fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I hate hockey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>If this is schizophrenia, you're gonna need regular care. I found some shelters that have full-time medical staff and also offer…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Oh, my arm really hurts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Let's have a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Ow… It feels like it's on fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We need to take a look under the bandages.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night. We assumed it was a schizophrenic delusion, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not. He's on Clozapine. He'd be getting better, not worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sounds like regional pain syndrome. Has to be a genetic disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Would you slow down! You're gonna get us arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I wouldn't worry about it. We'll probably die first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't make me take my shoe off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to run his DNA. He could have early onset of Parkinson's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration or Huntington's or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Hey, if you let us out, we can start testing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If we're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks. I'm not canceling my honeymoon to treat this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's a fake marriage, but a real honeymoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Most are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Danny could also die before we get through testing for all the possibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So we cheat. Since it's genetic, daddy or mommy's got it too. They're either sick or dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>He doesn't know where his mother is, and he won't tell us where his father is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's a homeless ex-junkie. Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him? Green light! </content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy got it for me. And now I'm drafting a request for a study into the effects of caffeine involving an Italian espresso machine and a massage chair, so make it quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I found Danny's father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The kid said he was in a state-sponsored rehab last November. There's only one Danny Jennings that was in treatment at the time, and he listed his father's address as his primary next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The "well done" was for making it quick. Now I'm gonna have to take that back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He lives about 30 minutes from the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the reason you're continuing to talk instead of driving there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Chase and Masters are already on their way.  Why didn't you ask me to be part of your wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Is it because I haven't been here as long as them? Or is it that you really don't like me? Or are… are you just s-screwing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Um… I'll… I'll come back when she's finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She is.  Oh, my God! W-what did you think she was doing? She's just installing the cable.  That's not a euphemism!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>Oh, I feel sorry for the little one. Isn't there something we can do?</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to talk to you about your son Danny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We're his doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to know if you, or perhaps his mother, have any family history of genetic disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You may not care about your son, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Um, not why we came here. We just want to know if there's any diagnosed genetic disease in your family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We're trying to make your son better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The important question is, who are you? Danny Jennings is dead, which means that Danny Jennings has no pulse. You, on the other hand… do. Ergo, you are not Danny Jennings.  Or I did the test wrong. So why don't you cut the crap and tell me your real name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hiding your identity… Well, either you're a criminal or a superhero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I'm not a criminal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Awesome. What color is my underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I'm not telling you my name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No problem. I just need your father's name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Care to tell me why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>He’s looking for me. He supposedly… cleaned up and got sober. And now he… he wants to be a part of my life again. And I can't let that happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're a big boy now. You still think he can hurt you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>You don't get it. If I ever see my dad again… I'll kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>What's happening to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, luckily for you, we don't need daddy to figure that one out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Did you find out his real name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cerebellar ataxia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>That's a weird name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup right in front of him. That plus everything else…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Means that we have whittled our list of genetic diseases…  All the way down to one… Early-onset Parkinson's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>After everything he's been through, now we have to tell him, "Hey, you have</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You could lie. I'm fine with that. But you'll probably both feel better if you give him Levodopa and confirm with DNA tests.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's gone too far. He's taking up six handicapped spaces with a monster truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's only four, and he's gonna get rid of it after the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And the chapel… He's turned the chapel into his own personal catering hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who cares? Other than a janitor sleeping off a bender, he's the first person to use it in two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Appeasement is never the answer in the face of naked aggression. It won't be long before his tanks are rolling down your Champs-Elysees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know what House is doing. You, on the other hand… why do you care? He isn't hurting anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're the first boss he's ever had who could handle him. Before you, he was either fired or buried under a mountain of malpractice suits. He needs someone to say no. He needs someone he'll listen to, when they say no. If you really care about House, you'll stop feeling sorry for him and get out there and start kicking him where he needs kicking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I changed my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What, you want the fish instead of the chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This room is for patients' families, not for doctors trying to defraud the government.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, so… you've decided to take a moral stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah. The chapel still has sanctity for some people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. I think I saw Blue the janitor passed out in one of the pews last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's "Lou," and I would have thrown him out too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, where are we gonna go? We got caterers staging everything downstairs as we speak. We've got floral arrangements, place settings… Other wedding-y stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's not my problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I sent out the invitations. People are coming here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's also not my problem.  And I want the TV back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>You should just let me die. The world's better off without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>It's normal. People feel depressed when they get bad news… because it's bad news… Obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I didn't O.D. by accident. I was trying to kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>'Cause I've done things… Horrible things. I've hurt people. And when I didn't die, I thought… I thought God forgave me. But he just wanted me to suffer. And I deserve it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No,  you don't deserve it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I… I had a girlfriend in college… And I almost killed her. I just snapped. And I started hitting her. And if her roommate hadn't come home… I'm evil. I am just like my dad. We're both monsters. I deserve to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I can't… I can't… I feel dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> I need a crash cart in here!</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>His heart is dilated and failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And at the rate it's happening, he'll need a new one soon. And there's no way we'll get him on the transplant list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are we missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Everything. We know nothing about this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Except that he's gotten worse since we admitted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Most of our patients tend to do that, unless we cure them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but why so fast? He had dysosmia for a couple months, never even came here to get it treated. He's just a random burn victim. We get him, boom, he's got tunnel vision, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and now cardiomyopathy. What's different here than, say, living in a filthy state park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think cleanliness is making him sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Allergic reaction? We treated him with Vicodin, Clozapine, and one I.V. bag of Levodopa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His condition started deteriorating before that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop that man!  I need the meal card for the patient in 243.  He's eating healthy… because he can. Most of the meals in here are vegetarian.  Adult Refsum disease… Fits all the symptoms. His body can't process the phytanic acid and chlorophyll. It's his healthy diet of green vegetables that's killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So if we change his diet…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We can save his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run him through a plasmapheresis treatment to remove the excess phytanic acid from his blood. Confirm with gene testing. Okay, I gotta go get married.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They say true love doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it never did. So without further ado…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Dominika</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Then by the power vested in me by the state of New Jersey just for today, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Those of you with cameras, please feel free to provide legal documentation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's okay. I'm just, angry at myself. I promised I wouldn't let this get to me. But it got to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just say the word, and we will climb out that window right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I wouldn't give House the satisfaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You see? Things are getting back to normal.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Are you feeling better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>So all I have to do is eat the right kinds of food, and I'll be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Basically, yeah. It's pretty limiting, and it is for the rest of your life. But if you follow the diet and get checked up regularly, you should be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Thank you… for not giving up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You're not a bad person. You made mistakes, but we all do. Maybe when you get out of here, you can… go talk to someone… A professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, some of those places you suggested had people on staff. You know, I think God really does have a plan for me. And all this… It was just his way of, testing my resolve. And I wouldn't have passed it without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>See you tomorrow, Danny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content> That's not my real name.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Danny disappeared without checking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>So you called the FBI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We didn't call them, they just showed up. Danny's DNA… When we sent it to the lab for testing, it set off alarm bells all over the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Alarm bells for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's linked to 13 unsolved murders in ten different states.</content></utterance>
