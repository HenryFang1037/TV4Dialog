<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You’re getting checked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I tripped on the ice. Eight other kids tripped. This is embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You said you were just going to hang with your friends. I turn around and you’re out there on the ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You don’t know that. You fell. Awkwardly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>No, I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You don’t know how to fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I’m sixteen. I’ve been falling a lot. I think I’m getting the hang of it. And I checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>And now the doctors are going to check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>You don’t think that you’re over reacting? I don’t need you to fix every boo-boo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>Then stop getting them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I was just playing around with my friends. I was having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You know you can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t have fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>You know what I mean. I’m gonna have a talk with your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Cynthia</speaker><content>And tell them that they need to stop…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>No! I don’t want you freaking them out! Fine. Fine, we’ll go to the hospital. But they’re going to tell you that I’m fine and they’re going to tell you that you don’t need to worry about…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Operator</speaker><content>911. What’s your emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>We got into an accident on the canal road just outside Kingston. My mom’s unconscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Operator</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content> I’m fine.  Mom. Mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>He’s down here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Somewhere. Very helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Do you have any idea when he’s getting out tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>I realize you can’t predict. I just thought you might be able to estimate. It’s Valentine’s Day. I’ve planned a surprise getaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Getaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Getaway.  Get away. </content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Is my mom okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s gone to surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman. Your girlfriend wants to know if you’re available for Valentine’s. Act surprised. What are you doing down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s a snowstorm. E.R.’s short staffed. We’re all supposed to be here. You’re supposed to be here. You’re an ass. Act surprised.  This could sting a little. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Ow.  Can we hurry this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Make sure that …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take your time. What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Hannah Morgenthal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have CIPA, Hannah Morgenthal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>No, I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have to do x-rays to make sure you don’t have internal injuries. Blood test to make sure no infections. An EEG for neurological anomalies and biopsy a spinal nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. Congenital Insensitivity to Pain is one of the rarest conditions on the planet. There’s only been about sixty documented cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, and I have seven reasons to think that she’s one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She says she’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And that’s reason number one. She knew what it was without us telling her. Two, she’s still went from the snow but she’s not shivering. That’s odd. Unless she can’t sweat or feel hot and cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>The ambulance was warm. I want to see my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three, scarring around the lip and tongue. When she was a baby she chewed on herself without feeling it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I fell through a window when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Four, when you cleaned the wound she flexed into the cleaner instead of away from it. It’s hard to fake pain when you’ve never felt it. Takes an imaginative leap, Ms. Morgenthal. That’s one of them Jew names. Ashkenazys are a higher risk group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>On the other hand, she says she doesn’t have it. And she’d be dead by now if she’d never been diagnosed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They killed our Lord. Are you going to trust them? She wants to see her mom. If she admits having CIPA she knows we’re not letting her go anywhere without a battery of tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You said you had seven reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I pulled a number out of the air. What, five isn’t enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Five lame reasons aren’t. I’m taking her to see her mom as… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I could hit her again if six aren’t enough. Do the tests. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Need to bail on the E.R. I got a case. Why are you wearing perfume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is this a real case or one of those imaginary cases that happen when you’re bored?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>CIPA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>CIPA is a diagnosis. Diagnoses happen at the end of cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s got no idea what’s going on in her body. There’s gotta be something wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>In other words, she could be perfectly healthy but you’re curious about someone who can’t feel pain because you always feel pain so you want to go exploring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was in a car accident. She needs x-rays, blood tests, EEG, nerve biopsy. I also note that, although the snow was coming down in sheets this morning, you left your hat at home and used ear muffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do your tests, except for the…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, while everyone else was just worrying about getting in, you were concerned with about “hat head.” Blind dates are never a good idea. Only reason to wear a scarf like that is as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do your tests. Except for the nerve biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need the nerve biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’d risk paralyzing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But it’s neurological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have no evidence of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She tripped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you have any evidence other than the fact that a typically clumsy CIPA patient tripped on an icy day?  If the EEG reveals a problem, we can talk then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You could have left the scarf at home and just told him you’d be wearing a look of desperation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Spiking on leads C3 and O2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She could be going into a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I think there’s a simpler explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>You’re not going to find anything. I’m fine. I wanna see my mom. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, sedate her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She won’t consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s a teenager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No dad, mom’s still in surgery. What do you want us to do? Hold her down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, only until you inject her with a sedative. Then you can let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We tried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s strong and doesn’t care. We’d have broken something before we could get her to sit still enough to inject her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, break her arm. She won’t mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re cranky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m in pain. Let’s go break her arm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nurse Shortie, your biz-nitch, how long are you gonna waste her time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m so glad we’re walking somewhere. Another sixty feet and this conversation is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When you guys are out of this program, Cameron will find somebody. Chase will find eight somebodies. And you’ll be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Thirty feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’ll date and you’ll date. But you’re the ultimate Darwinian. You’ve got to fight for everything. Anybody else would just slow you down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m still with her, aren’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. I can only imagine it’s because she hasn’t given you an excuse to break up and you don’t have the guts to recognize your own reality. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I want to see my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi again. I'm sure I can say this without being condescending, but then you'd get the false impression that I respect you so – you're a kid, you're scared, you're stalling. Grow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I'm not scared. I'm never scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? How juvenile was that? You can't feel pain. Nothing left but pleasure. Why don't you tell me how wonderful that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>It sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Better than being in pain all the time. Get in the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Every morning I have to check my eyes to make sure I didn't scratch a cornea in my sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh God, stop. I'm in a pool of tears here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I can't cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neither can I. Every morning I check my eyes for jaundice in case the Vicodin's finally shot my liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I can't run anywhere without examining all my toes for swelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can't run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Boys can't hold me for too long because I can overheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Girls can't hold me for too long because I only pay for an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I need an alarm on my watch to remind me to go to the bathroom. You know how many humiliating experiences before I thought of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The bathroom's 50 feet from my office. Every drink of water I weigh the pros and cons,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>After everything I do, I self-check: Mouth, tongue, gums for cuts. Count teeth, check temperature. Fingers, toes and joints for swelling, skin for bruises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I sat on the stove when I was three. Want to see the coil marks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>You think I’m lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think I just wanna check out your tuchus, as your people would say.  Put her in the chair and run the damn test. If she moves again, give her nitrous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You weren't shot because of leg pain, you were shot because you're a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Some think the two are connected.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>He didn’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>I’m sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, your EEG was normal. X-rays showed no breaks, blood test showed no infections, urine indicated no…  Hannah?  Call a code. Oh, God.  Need ice packs and cooling blankets. Got saline in there? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>She’s not flushed. She’s not sweaty. You must be…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She has a temperature of 105. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. She’s actually sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’ve got her temperature down below boiling. Could be infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. LP showed normal proteins and no white blood cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>High billirubin. Could be a liver problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Transaminases were normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be drugs. She’s smoked pot since she was eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No again. Tox screen was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’re doing this case backwards. We do the tests and then she gets sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe we did something to her. Maybe she got sick after the tests. We should rerun them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And biopsy a spinal nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want to risk paralysis because she’s got a fever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to risk paralysis because I don’t know what’s causing the fever. If it’s neurological…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s a fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In a CIPA patient. Obviously things are a little different in her upstairs wiring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And have been since the day she was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yah. It’s much more likely that whatever it is was cleverly waiting and hiding until you guys were done testing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re all against this, right? And, you’re all going to stand on principle and refuse to do it, right? I’m going to get Cuddy’s approval.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How long are we going to keep Hannah in the dark about her mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Long as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Side air bag should be standard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’m sure she’ll agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She should know her mother’s situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Breaking that news is that surgeon’s problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Any word from House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe Cuddy will say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Cuddy never says no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nobody ever says no. We don’t say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don’t say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’ll come back. He’ll browbeat us. He’ll give us seven reasons and eventually we’ll fold. We all will. Not just me. The only way we can avoid biopsying this kid’s spine is to find the answer some other way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All the tests were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need a better history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How much more paperwork do you need? We’ve got pediatric records, a few dozen E.R. records, our own admission questionnaire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What’s the first question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Insurance coverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay. Second question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just make your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Where does it hurt? If we knew where it hurt, we could diagnose her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You do know CIPA means she can’t feel pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. CIPA means she’s insensitive to pain. She still has scattered nerve fibers that could conduct pain but the signals don’t make it to the brain. What if we give her more pain signals? A lot more pain signals. Maybe some of them might get through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You want to torture her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. Yes, we do this to anybody else, it’s torture. Doing it to her, it’s no different than pricking her finger. We keep poking sharp sticks into her, eventually we’ll find the part that’s already tender.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>So, what does a dean of medicine do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, can we please not talk about that. I will talk about anything else, but I’m just trying to get away from work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Metaphorically. Because, geographically the coffee place around the corner from the hospital probably isn’t the furthest you could get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well the snow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Roads are clearing. But it’s a good place to beat a retreat from. Do you usually expect your dates to go wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Experience has taught me to have an escape route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Well, low expectations, that’s in my favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Whatever happens, I need you to understand that there are certain aspects to my life, I’m not happy about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I need the nerve biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you had to come here personally to tell me that. And how did you even know I was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had to bring the file. This is the most noncommittal location within walking distance. You left your car keys on your desk.  Greg House. You two must have met online. Either that or you’ve got a friend who secretly hates you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Uh, Don Herrick. Yeah, we connected through singleballroomdancelovers.com.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would he volunteer that information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Why would I hide it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn’t tell him that anything he said will be held against you?  So, what line of work are you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Uh, auto maintenance. Changing oil and filters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great, my place overcharges. You can’t trust anything you guys say. So, where are you located?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>In fourteen states. I own Eastern Lube. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Most CIPA complications are infection and she’s got a fever. LP? Urine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Clean. Normal. Same with the white blood cell count.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The paralysis caused the fall. Spine’s clean. No veritable fractures or spinal cord compression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even better. The nuttiness and paralysis means there’s definitely a neurological component.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Could be a nerve disease.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Had to give you the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I assume you’re thinking thyroid storm. You done a hormone panel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Normal. TSH was on the low side. Is that a cheery fire I hear crackling nearby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. What about CPK enzymes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Elevated. 275. Of course, people light fires for themselves. But then they don’t deny it. He’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>CPK isn’t high enough. Potassium’s what you’d expect because of the bronchodilators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh my God. You’re not wearing a bra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s not thyroid storm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Do you like me, House? I was on the phone with Bennett 15 minutes ago. His cell phone’s working. You’re M.O is to avoid me at all costs.

<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You noticed he was a Shriner because of the way he parted his hair. You noticed he was a momma’s boy because of the way he blinked his left eye. I’m not interested. I’m not impressed. There are only two reasons anyone would want to screw with me tonight. Either they’re an altruistic, decent person who’s worried about my well being. Or, they want me for themself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You left out the third option. Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people’s happiness.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-29"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I only said those things so he wouldn’t come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-30"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>I don’t really care about my job. I do it well. I provide a service. But my goal was always to make enough money to do the things I really like. Music. Travel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-32"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>You like them but they’re not really important to you. I don’t know whether it’s House, your job or if you just thrive on conflict but… You should hear yourself when you’re talking to him. Nothing else in the world’s going on. You’re focused, confident, compelling. Don’t… don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d like to go out with that woman.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You could paralyze her and get no useful information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do the biopsy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A little further from the truth. We’re talking paralysis. Good chance the spine is relevant. This thing is progressing. It could kill her in hours.  Give me back my papers.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Give us a minute?  Did you know they recently found a protein that speeds up nerve growth? Fascinating stuff. If you put that protein with the insulation from a spinal nerve, you could grow your own little garden. If that spinal nerve…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If it happened to come from a person with CIPA I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg. What an evil plan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wow, you nailed it. It was basically like a wasted weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The sacrifices you made were huge. But they were at the height of your love for him. Commitment is only commitment because it has no expiration date. You stand next to someone and watch them floss for 30 years like my parents have, then ask for sacrifices. That's how you know the real thing. Cameron, I wasn't criticizing you. People who avoid commitment are people who know what a big thing it is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You okay? We’re gonna have to take her back to surgery. Hannah, your BP is way up. We need to get you some rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content> My hand’s wet.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what does the pain tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No tingling, no itching. So we can rule out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It tells us nothing. It wasn’t physical pain, it was emotional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. What were they doing when she got the headache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Saying goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said they were arguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They weren’t really arguing. She was just frustrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What were they arguing about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Whose fault it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Peripheral neuropathy, fever and intermittent paranoia. Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things. But what if we add guilt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Guilt as a symptom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Alzheimer’s can cause euphoria. Pain causes depression. And B12 deficiency causes guilt along with all that other stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If she felt guilty, she wouldn’t be making her mother’s life miserable. She wouldn’t be getting into fights, getting arrested…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe she’s fighting because she feels guilty. She’s showing her mom she can take stupid risks and still be safe. Means her mom can let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is rational. If guilt is a symptom it’s caused by the illness, not by a thought process. And it would have to be new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A couple of years ago she was a model student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is pointless. If the headache was caused by the illness, it means she has a B12 deficiency. If it’s just because she was sad, it’s meaningless. How the hell do we test for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We don’t. Give her a shot of B12. If she gets better, I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We already did.  The E.R. gave her B12 when she was admitted, part of a multivitamin supplement. Apparently she’s just sad.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Trying to get a couple of patients into a drug trial. Paperwork’s due tomorrow. Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I still haven’t figured out why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, I meant here. In my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just dumped a cool B12 theory. Moved on to leukemia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Very pedestrian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not happy. Her white blood cell count was low. But the ones she’s got… Just a whole lot of eosinophils.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The immunoglobulin E level’s borderline. If you want to be one hundred percent sure, check the bone marrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Team’s doing a biopsy right now.  So it turns out, the weird lawyer knew that she used to be a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And he’s cool with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ho, ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is it possible for you to just watch me eat. Or do you get some primeval thrill out of beating the other hunters to the food.  See you later.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s so you don’t move during the procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that nitrous? What are you, trying to kill her? You gave her nitrous during the EEG. That’s what made this thing rear it’s ugly head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>B12 deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Are you having déjà vu? We’ve had this conversation. She was given B12. She didn’t get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because someone else ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>What? What are you doing?  Don’t touch me. Don’t touch me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See. There she goes. Another paranoid delusion. She’s going downhill. Forget the MRI. We need an O.R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Leave me alone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Hannah</speaker><content>Help. They’re trying to kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. You can either believe that we really are trying to kill her… or you can assume that she’s suffering from a medical condition. Seeing as this is a hospital and we’re all dressed like doctors and there are easier ways to kill somebody…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>Bev, help them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m going to need iodine, scalpel numbers 10 and 15, forceps and a largish salad bowl.  Okay. Hold her down. Come on, weenies, she’s in a cast. Swab.  Fifteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Surgeon</speaker><content>You’re not going to anesthetize her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. It’s just a magic trick.  She’s faking it.  We’re not falling for it this time.  Okay, keep that retracted.  Forceps.  Lake fishing can be fun. It can bring the generations together.  If you don’t cook that trout or perch well, you’ll be giving room and board to this fellow. By free board, I mean all the B12 you can take in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Bev</speaker><content>I could have a tapeworm in me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not likely. You’d be in a lot of pain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s gotta be twenty five feet long.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hannah. Wake up. Somebody here to see you. She’s got limited motion on her left side. You might have to take care of her for a while.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don’t feel it, but you’re about to rip your stitches out. Take care of yourself. Then you can take care of her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>I’m dating a doctor. I’d be an idiot to expect anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I did get you a gift.  MGH – best teaching hospital in Boston. Wanna be a nurse practitioner, that’s as good as it gets.  I made a few calls and, you’re in if you want in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>This is why you’ve been helping me get my surgical hours for accreditation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought you wanted…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content> Stupid. You’ve got ten feet of personal space around you. I step forward, you step back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’ve shared a lot of things with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Which is why you’re breaking up with me. You can’t stand to be close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wendy, you think I’ll stay with you because you’re angry with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>I’m upset. Because I care. Only you’d expect an argument to be rational. You and that ass boss of yours. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She owes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The hospital will send her a bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m just saying, if you wanna do it, do it while her B12 is still low. Guilt can be your friend.  Breakfast?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wow. Thank you for that dash of cold water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Don't get me wrong. I still think true love's out there it's just very far away. Possibly in another galaxy. We may need to develop faster than light travel before we can make contact.  So I'm thinking we should have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Despite the wisdom of pop songs. there's no point in putting our lives on hold 'til love comes along. We're both healthy and busy people. We work together so it's convenient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Like microwave pizza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And of all the people I work with, you're the one I'm least likely to fall in love with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Like… microwave pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The point here is to make things simpler, not more complicated. Someday there'll be time to get serious about someone. Meanwhile, we already had sex once and didn't get weird about it. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I get it. I get it. So, what if I'm offended by your judgement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Then you're not the man I'm looking for. </content></utterance>
