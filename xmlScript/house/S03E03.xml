</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Doctor </speaker><content>You're not gonna make this easy, are you?  Unfortunately; as much as I admire your spirit, je ne sais rien.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>71 year old cancer research specialist. Minor tremors, localized melanoma removed 2 years ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe. Also, disregard the facial lacerations. They're creepy, but unfortunately irrelevant.  Don't you wanna know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You… have your cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, why the lacerations are creepy. He was about to dissect one of his lab rats when he collapsed. The little vermin seized the day, so to speak and went medieval on his ass.  What, my fly open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So the… the pain's returned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're talking about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously. I'm obviously not. What is it with you people? I don't use the cane, you're shocked. I use the cane…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're just concerned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About the wrong person. I can breathe. Ezra Powell on the other hand, is gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>THE Ezra Powell???</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The researcher? The guy who wrote that textbook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>*That* textbook, THE textbook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wait - there's actually another doctor you admire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I… admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Oxygenation is through the floor and lungs are full of fluid. Gotta be his heart; could be amyloidosis. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Or his lungs; probably from using and inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not the lungs. Chest x-ray is clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So's his EKG, it's not his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're being too nice.  Outside the hospital he can't breathe, inside the hospital he can. Means we help, at least enough to screw with our test results. The source of the problem's either in his heart or his lungs. So all we gotta do is stop helping, put a little pressure on him, and see which gives out first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>At 71, we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get 'em to give in again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital. Put him on an incline treadmill and do a stress EKG. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So much for the admiration.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Let's get you started.  I'll turn your oxygen up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>I… I worked with Williams on the first protocol for this machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Everyone still uses it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>Except for Williams. He died four years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>He was 84. He died parasailing. He was always  an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>You okay?  Hang in there. You know the protocol’s only a few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His heart rate's flat. We don’t get it past 130, we're not gonna see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And if he falls and breaks a hip, we're not gonna see anything</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>I figured House might go back to the pills, but if he's using his cane he's right back to where he was before. Maybe even worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Luckily he'll handle it in a stoic, grown-up fashion -- he'd never take it out on us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>I can't. I… I gotta stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>Just a little longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His heartbeat's only 90. I'm gonna increase the incline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>I gotta stop. I… I… I gotta get off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're doing great, just a little faster, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>I don't need a cheerleader, I need oxygen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>Stop, this isn't working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His heart rate barely got above 90.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He can't breathe, there's too much fluid in his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>REALLY!? He's got FLUID in his lungs, whatever are we gonna do?? Oh yeah, now I remember.  Put him on a treadmill and run him like one of his rats on a wheel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He can't run, he can hardly walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's drowning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Then pull him outta the pool, and… Do. It. Again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>I'm assuming this isn't your idea of a long term solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need to get rid of the fluid in your lungs, so you'll be able to do the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>To see if it's my heart, or my lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>My money's on both.  I've been in and out of the hospital for the past year. I'm old. And sick. I'm getting older and sicker. Not a very interesting differential, but…  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Dad </speaker><content>You don't need a $400 handbag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Dad </speaker><content>Oh… sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Daughter</speaker><content>But it's for the fall formal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>House </speaker><content>He doesn't care if it's for the presidential inauguration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Dad </speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Daughter</speaker><content>But I'm using Marissa's old dress, it's free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah, you know what else is free? The roof over your head, the food you eat,  your phone, your computer.  How long have you been congested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>All week, ever since we got back from Fresno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Fresno. That's in France, right? See the Parthenon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Uh, California. I've got no appetite, I'm aching all over, I'm weak...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Does that hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Does his voice always have that unattractive nasal tone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Daughter </speaker><content>Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>House </speaker><content>I'm gonna take that giggle as a no. Fever, aches, weakness, loss of appetite.  You been having any anal sex with I.V. drug users lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Dad </speaker><content>Of course not, I'm married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>House </speaker><content>You think she might've been having--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Dad and Daughter </speaker><content>NO!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>House </speaker><content>It's probably a rhinovirus. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cold.  Take this 4 times a day, and stay off airplanes. Flying cesspools.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Daughter </speaker><content>Oops!  You dropped something. If there's anything else you can think of, please call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's… too old and weak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>Yeah, this is way better. This'll work. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>House </speaker><content>There are 20 words to describe chest pain -- burning, squeezing, stabbing, tearing -- each one diagnostically useful. For that you have to thank Dr. Powell's textbook. There are no words to describe degrees of what he's feeling right now -- shortness of breath. If he'd worked on those issues, there would be. Because he never would have given up until he had an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>This isn't working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>Dr. House…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Please don't get up. I'm sure you're very busy.  I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is that Epi? That's not the protocol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>House </speaker><content>No, the protocol, is what you tried to do and failed each time.  Over 100… now we're getting somewhere. How's it look, Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>No EKG changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Then we push harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House, you're gonna kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>No, he's right, let him -- let him do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>He can't breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>House</speaker><content>130.  The magic number. Nothing here. Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still no sign of blockage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means it's not the heart. So it must be the lungs.  See? That wasn't so hard, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>No! Just -- give me the rest of the epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The test is over, it's okay, we're gonna stabilize you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>No!  No. Just let me die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're not gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>Yes, I a-am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We'll find a treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>I don't wanna live like this. Please. I'm begging you.  Kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He says no more tests. He wants to die, and he wants us to help him do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>House </speaker><content>And I want to play a little game I like to call ‘Block My Spike’ with Misty Mae.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-85"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's thought this through; it's not an impulsive decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-86"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-87"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to reverse it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-88"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-89"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>It's his call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-90"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what do we do? We put a plastic bag over his head and get it over with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-91"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No. We give him a syringe full of morphine.  Every doctor I've ever practiced with has done it. They don't want to, they don't like to, but that's the way it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-92"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>I haven't, I won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-93"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I couldn't do it either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-94"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>You just said we should respect his decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-95"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Respect it doesn't necessarily mean we honor it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-96"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right. Just means we talk about it.  At some point, do no harm has to mean allowing nature to take its course, not stubbornly standing in the way of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-97"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sticking a metal syringe into a plastic I.V. line and pumping in a lethal dose of morphine is not letting nature take its course. Not according to the state of New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-98"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So it's better we allow him to slowly suffocate in his own plasma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-99"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-100"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow.  Certainly a lot of interesting things to consider. Stress EKG rules out the heart, which means something's gotta be attacking his lungs. Mycoplasmas or strep pneumo, which probably means it's too late to do anything about it. We could try levofloxacin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-101"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Coming up with a new treatment isn't gonna do us any good unless we convince him it's worth trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-102"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatever we want to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-103"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-104"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>I don't know. Must've fallen out of bed and got the nasal canula wrapped around his neck somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-105"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Ezra, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-106"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>I don't wanna live hooked to machines, too weak to wipe my own ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-107"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Why would you wanna wipe your own ass when you can have someone do it for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-108"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>You're wasting your time. There must be other patients you could actually help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-109"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-110"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>I won't consent! To any more tests. And if anyone tries to so much as touch me, I'll press charges for assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-111"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Okay well you heard the man; he wants everyone to leave him alone.  Why don't you go first.  GET OUT!  You came to me, I didn't come to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-112"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>I figured you'd have the guts to do what had to be done, if it came to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-113"><speaker>House </speaker><content>We're nowhere near that. It's time to test your lungs.  Breathe! You have to exhale sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-114"><speaker>Foreman </speaker><content>Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-115"><speaker>Cameron </speaker><content>House, you're hurting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-116"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're hurting me.  Fine; you don't help us, we don't help you.  Your lungs slowly fill with fluid. You gasp to catch every breath but never can. Every breath is petrifying. It'll be slow, painful; torturous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-117"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>We don't choose our birth, and we don't choose our death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-118"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if you could? How 'bout we make a deal? Give me one more day. If I don't find out exactly what's wrong with you by then, I help you die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-119"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-120"><speaker>House</speaker><content>24 hours. Come on, it's not gonna kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-121"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>Ha. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Old guy. Lungs. Fluid. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You canNOT help him kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cuddy's not gonna let you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Enough! You don't want me to kill him. Fine. Here's a big shock; I don't wanna kill him either. How do I not kill him? By you guys doing your job. We have 24 hours to figure out what's wrong with him.  Tick tock, tick tock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia; should be bacteria in his blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not if I spin down the sample. Separate off the buffy coat, then gram stain for bacteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer, C-reactive peptide, get a urine, and do a bronchial sputum while you're at it.  You check his home and lab for radiation and toxins.  And do a bone marrow biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All of that in 24 hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nah. Whatever you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Wow. You guys look like crap.  Whaddya got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chase </speaker><content>Purple dye on my fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Don't have the results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What? What've you been doing all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>JELLO shots and wild sex, what else? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No bacteria in the blood cultures. We still have some cooking, but so far, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nothing in the urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Lab was clean enough to do surgery in, because well, they *do*. There was no sign of viruses or fleas on any of the rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>House </speaker><content>Yeah. -- Who? – Well… tell her to call the clinic. Then tell her to leave a message, and I'll get back to her.  Then tell her to leave a personal message. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Who's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your protégé. What are these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dictation tapes. He records everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because he's a diligent researcher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or he's losing his memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>A lot of people dictate their notes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing. Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatever's in his lungs, is also in his brain. Unless you got something more promising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'll go get an MRI of his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Powell </speaker><content>It's been a long time since I took an anatomy  class, but I'm pretty sure you're moving farther and farther away from my lungs. Running out of places to look aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>No, not for six more hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You want us to fail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Powell</speaker><content>No, but you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia; he a drinker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not according to the history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Which means yes, he drinks, which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>But your entire view of human nature gets destroyed.  Six of one, half a dozen of the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Head is clean. You were wrong, his faculties are intact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it’s way further down the list than murder.  He’s unconscious. No more whining. I’m gonna keep testing him.  Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Were you in that room with him? Was he wearing a tux while he was choking on his own plasma? Keep doing the tests. Take your time, do it right. Go.  Get to work.  Wait!  Cameron, why’d you do these cuts so far down on this MRI of his head?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ok. Lying is sometimes good, right? Like when you’re trying to teach someone a lesson about humility, or something. All I’m trying to do is save his life. He’s not gonna learn anything; I just thought the same principle might apply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I coulda just let him die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is comforting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’re doctors: We treat patients, we don’t kill them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> How right you are, Dr. Cuddy! We also don’t pad our bills, swipe samples from the pharmacy, or fantasize about the teenage daughters of our patients, either.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.  We really should spend some time talking about that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The IVIG made him worse. O2 stats plummeted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> So we know it’s not Lupus. What else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because, if I think less of him, I’ll help you more? You’re wrong. The fact that a patient did bad things doesn’t change anything. He still deserves to have some control over his own body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If he had control of his own body, he’d be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Some control. We can withhold treatment without killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No you can’t! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can’t have it both ways. </content></utterance>
