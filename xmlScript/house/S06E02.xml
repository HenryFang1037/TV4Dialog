<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So how’s this supposed to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You sit. I sit. We talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>About whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me to whine about my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Do you want to whine about your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>If that’s where you’d like to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve had a billion things happen to me in my life. How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>As far as I’m concerned, they’re all relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, we better get moving, ‘cause this session could take 50 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Yes, you are the sum of everything that’s happened to you. And, yes, some events are more relevant than others. But, uh, the only way we can figure out which ones are is to talk. So tell me, what’s on your mind?  What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to get better… Whatever the hell that means. I’m sick of being miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>So you’d like to be happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again with the reflecting – Yes, I’d like to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Being happy is an excellent goal. Not many patients can crystallize exactly what they’re hoping to get out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, bully for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content> So now all we have to do is figure out how to get you from here to happy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>SSRIs? That’s your genius technique?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I don’t think we should ignore any tools than can help.  I know you don’t have a problem taking drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For my leg. For pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Well, think of this as being for psychic pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t want to change who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Miserable?  Do you think that by taking meds you’ll lose your edge, stop making the unique connections that make you a successful doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If Van Gogh was your patient, he’d be satisfied painting houses instead of The Starry Night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Van Gogh would still be making inspired paintings of the night sky, just maybe not from the room of his asylum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I know both his ears would be intact. And I know his life would be better.  I know this doesn’t come naturally to you. But you want my help, which means you need to trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm… Delicious.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m waiting for my communion wafer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You’re cheeking it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Tell me you’re cheeking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I swallowed it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>No, you didn’t. We don’t take meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don’t take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You’re scamming again. You can tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not scamming, Alvie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>They broke you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They didn’t break me. I am broken. Now stop worshipping me and go worry about your own loser life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>I hate you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Got an assignment for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Role-playing? I’m not sure how pretending to be a businessman with a foot fetish is gonna help, but I’m game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Have you connected with any of the other patients? You’ve been here four weeks. Tell me about your relationships with the other patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Diane… is convinced that Silent Girl hates her. Richter’s not as paranoid as you think. He just likes that you think that. And my roommate hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Only one of the things you said indicated how somebody else feels about you. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sure that they’ve done some form of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I’m a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You know, there is a way for them to find out things about you without deductive reasoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have had relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You’ve screwed up relationships. Every one of them. Almost like that was the goal. I want you to trust… people.  Try.  Get dressed. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just open up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Just open up. Trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Strangers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>We’ll start with strangers then work our way up. If it helps, I find “hello” to be an excellent icebreaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Garney</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s like “hello” only shorter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Garney</speaker><content>Yes. I’m glad we were able to save that time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Judging by the fancy suit, I’d say you were a donor. The nervous demeanor says maybe you’ve had issues, probably why this place has personal meaning.  But this is supposed to be about me.  I take advantage of my friends. Friend, really, I’ve only got one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Garney</speaker><content>It can be tough sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Garney</speaker><content>Oh, neither am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I am. See that guy over there?  He’s my lover. He’s also my psychiatrist, which some would argue is a little inappropriate, but they just don’t know what love is. Am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>You’re not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Maybe they should be true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hadn’t thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should probably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let’s get me better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I’m a philanderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Philanderer doesn’t mean that I give a lot to charity. It means –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I-I know what it means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d’oeuvres.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Honey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>What did my husband just say to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I… was asking him if there were nuts… in the hors d’oeuvres.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Then where is your EpiPen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>My what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>No one with an allergy would walk around without an EpiPen. Give me your purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> Give me your purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Come –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What really happened is… I thought he was cute. I hit on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> We’re going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Having fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did connect with one guy. But my propensity for screwing things up overtook me. Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You didn’t screw it up. The assignment wasn’t to get you to trust people with a piece of your soul. The assignment was to teach you that you can trust. Did any of these people rat you out as the obnoxious womanizer or the porn producer that they think you are?  Why do you think that people would treat you worse if they knew the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Good night, Doctor.  Are you in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Apparently not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>So what’s next? You want to be my pimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don’t we just talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How come you weren’t pissed at me for stealing your car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>It was a nice thing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hmmm. I’m not sure about the German-English translation of “nice.” Stealing was nice or… ruining Freedom Master’s life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>What you did was misguided and irresponsible, but it was also nice. You gave him a moment of pure happiness.  You asked me why I come here so often to visit Annie. She was my best friend. Then she started pulling away… from everybody. The doctors don’t know why. I think I married her brother because he was the only other one who was going through the same thing. But he stopped visiting after a couple of years. I just… couldn’t stop. I miss her.  I should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re talking to me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Was it fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She kissed me. Don’t read into the phrasing. We kissed each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>And how do you feel about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do I feel about that? It was a kiss. Kisses are good things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That was a loaded “okay.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Not at all. Why would you assume that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Cause you’re being judgmental. If I’d said that I’d had some delicious Chilean sea bass for dinner last night, would you say, “and how do you feel about that?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>If the sea bass was married, I might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> See, you’re being judgmental. Isn’t that against your code or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I’m simply stating the obvious. It’s complicated. Not just because she’s married and not just because you’re institutionalized. I know you spent the last 12 hours trying to figure out what that kiss means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Who’s that woman you were with in the parking lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>When you deflect, it’s more effective when you’re not that transparent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously you have no problem with the infidelity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You’re trying to rationalize that, “if it’s okay for your doctor, it’s okay.” But, just for the record, I am not having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Why do you think you’re working so hard to figure out the details of my personal life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I might not have to work so hard if there were some personal items in here. You got one number on speed dial. It says “Dad.” Come on, how old are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Why are you so afraid to talk about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to talk about you. I want to know who I’m taking advice from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I’m not giving you advice. I’m asking you questions. I think that kiss meant a lot. I think that scares you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think there are no personal items in here because you have no personal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>How do you think you and Lydia will end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>you are a lonely man. You’ve screwed up every opportunity you’ve had in life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>What’s the ending to the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don’t know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Orderly</speaker><content>Visiting time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why did you kiss me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> How many reasons are there?  I like you. It felt like a nice way of showing you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Safer</speaker><content>Open it all the way. Keep it open.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>How’d it go with Lydia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I found out you can only be happy so long before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator. Philosophically speaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Why do you value your failures more than your successes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My mother caught me masturbating… to pictures of her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Can we get past these cut deflections?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Successes only last until someone screws them up. Failures are forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>So you accept that fact. You accept that there’s nothing you can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I accept the fact that there’s nothing I can do. Now, what can I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You acknowledge failure, and you move past it. You apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow. Powerful things, these apologies. Get someone to jump off a building and you say two words and you move on with your life. Hardly seems fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Is that the issue? You caused him pain. If the world is just, you have to suffer equally?  You’re not God, House. You’re just another screwed-up human being who needs to move on. Apologize to him. Let yourself feel better. Then you can learn to let yourself… keep feeling better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Dr. House, everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Time for group.  Group time everybody.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>I have a surprise. Two weeks from today we’re going to have the Mayfield Talent Show. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Talent show? Who’s in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>I’d really love it if everybody here could participate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Then who’s gonna watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>The staff will come. Friends and family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>You gonna tape this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>No, it’s just for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Richter</speaker><content>Well, if it’s just for us, I vote we don’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Think of it as a fun way to work on – on our therapeutic issues. Alvie, maybe you could sing one of your songs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>I don’t sing. I rap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Okay, well you can write something just for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>I don’t write. I just do, freestyle style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>I think you’re gonna want to be prepared. Make something special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Always special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>How bout you, Diane? Is there something you’d like to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Diane</speaker><content>I don’t have any talents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Sure you do. You all do. Steve, don’t you think that Diane has hidden talent that we’d all like to see come out? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You really think he’s gonna answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Because things pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Things change. It doesn’t mean they get better. You gotta make things better, you can’t just keep talking and hope for the best. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Diane, maybe you and I can work together and figure something out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I can save him. “They stole her voice box.” That’s what he said. That’s what she was staring at. That’s why she’s staring. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Dr. House, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content> ‘Cause there’s a music box in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Orderly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Come on, just give it to me. I can –  I am not having a psychotic break.  I promise you this will work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s the blue box there on the top shelf.  This is what you wanted. This is what you needed – a voice.  You thought you could cure Silent Girl with this so by your own rationale, it should cure you.  There’s nothing wrong with you. You’re healing. All the parts work. Speak!  Come on, speak! Say something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content> I think maybe everyone should take a break now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You’re trying to fix instead of moving on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>I brought Dvorak. Four hands.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need to know what this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>It’s sheet music.  I told you. It’s just… two people having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s two possible outcomes. It ends, someone gets hurt. Or it doesn’t end, someone gets hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>So, the end sucks. It doesn’t mean the beginning has to. Everything ends. Life ends. It – it doesn’t mean that we can’t enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t – I can’t do this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>All I know is, I was happy five minutes ago, and now I’m not. How’s that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good-bye, Lydia. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Diane</speaker><content>I’m really worried about ECT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Apprehension’s normal. Has anyone else had it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>They shocked me, man.  Aaah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Diane</speaker><content>Thanks. That’s very reassuring. I don’t know if I should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, just do the treatment or shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Greg, there’s a process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, a process. Wouldn’t want to disrupt the process with results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Heezy had a rough night last night. Guess he decided to go back to being an ass instead of a hypocrite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Let’s move on. Alvie, are you making any progress writing your rap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Yeah. But really, no. I just don’t want to write my songs down. It takes all the spontaneity out of it. It’s not… of the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Alvie, if you write things down –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>When the time comes, my rhyme comes. When my spotlight shines… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re a genius. Rhymes with “penius.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content> Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley.  Dr Nolan asked me to give you this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Is this a day pass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Medina</speaker><content>He’d like to see you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Thanks for coming.  I was hoping you could, uh, take a look at my dad’s chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A consult? What happened – you went through every sane doctor in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I thought you wouldn’t mind getting off the ward.  The cleaning lady found him on the kitchen floor. Doctors here don’t think that he’ll recover, that I should pull the plug. I want a second opinion so I – I thought I’d be a fool not to call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Lacunar infarct. Converted to hemorrhagic stroke. It squashed his brain. They didn’t miss anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>That’s what I thought. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s what you knew. His brain has been replaced by blood. It’s over.  And that’s obvious to any doctor who looked at that scan, even a shrink. You want someone to tell you that what you need to do is okay, to give you permission, absolution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Not now, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have no friends, no family. At some point, you made a mistake. You lost everything. And now I’m the closest thing you got to a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content> Just shut up. I don’t need you here to play this game.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sorry I pushed you away. It’s what I do when I’m afraid.  Again, German-English translation may be a little off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> I’m not – I’m not crying because of you. I’m crying because I’m pathetic. I brought her cello in case she magically wakes up for the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, well, then I take the apology back.  We’re all pathetic. It’s what makes everything interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>I’m sick of life being interesting.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Trio</speaker><content>You’re nobody till somebody loves you.  You’re nobody till somebody cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content> Ladies and gentlemen. The one, the only, Juan Alvarez!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Yo, yo, what’s up?  Ward Six is jumping off, y’all! Give it up for DJ Richter on the ones and twos. Yo, DJ Richter, spin that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Uh. Yah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Then we wouldn’t have no regrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Wanna know my secrets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And my roommate is a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Dr. House is in the house, y'all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I can't get no sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>You got think before you act</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> If you don't make connections</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content> Yeah, so tell me, doctor, what I really got to know</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Just do a talent show. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Oh, well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> But at least we have each other</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>Oh, we got each other, oh, we got each other</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How are you doing? You hanging in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Usually I open with that.  Thanks for staying.  So, um… What do you want to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Things are actually… Actually good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Okay, you're not – you're not just saying that because you don't want to complain in front of the guy who just lost his father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but… I'm good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sorry.  I was trying to prove a point. I was trying to be right. I ended up putting you in a dangerous situation, and I was not equipped to handle it. You got hurt, and it's my fault. And I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Safer</speaker><content> Med time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm gonna try those pink ones today. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Annie</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Freedom Master</speaker><content> You're welcome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got a surprise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>Today we're here to congratulate… Annie! We're proud of her! We wish her well, and we hope to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>Never see her again!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you go silent for over a decade, you don't just get to slide right back into society.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>She's going to a rehab facility first… In Arizona. Her family's moving there. Sorry, House. I just found out myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want an overnight pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>I can help you with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've earned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>You have, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Isn't extending trust part of the whole "getting me better" thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>If you insist on a pass, I'll give it to you. But I know where you're going, and I know you haven't thought it through. We need to sit down, talk about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Please give me the pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Hello. Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> Ben, go inside, okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You didn't say anything. And now Annie's leaving, and I hear you're going to Arizona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>My husband travels to Phoenix a lot. His corporate headquarters are there. We've been wanting to move for years, but we've been tethered here. And now we're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't want you to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>I don't want to go. But I can't break up my family. I-I can't leave my children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just don't want it to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content> I'm sorry that I didn't come to say good bye. I thought it ended kind of perfect.  I have to go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Not the most exciting use of the overnight pass I've ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>And...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content> I'm gonna write your letter… To the medical board, recommending that they give your license back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can't just console me by giving me a lollipop when I skin my knee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Well, two things just happened. You got hurt, which means you connected to someone else strongly enough to miss them. And more important… You recognized the pain and came to talk to me, instead of hiding from it in the Vicodin bottle. The fact that you're hurting and you came here, the fact that you're taking your meds and we're talking right now… Come inside and get some sleep. Tomorrow you can start saying your good-byes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Nolan</speaker><content>Today we're here to congratulate Greg.  We're proud of him. We wish him well, and we hope…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content> To never see him again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>House!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Back off. People already think we're gay.</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Beasley</speaker><content>What do you need, Alvie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Alvie</speaker><content>My meds. I want to get better.</content></utterance>
