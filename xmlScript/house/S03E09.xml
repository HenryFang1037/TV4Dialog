<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's on parts of her body that we haven't touched. She's got a fever of a hundred-and-three. She's in and out of consciousness. But it's not a reaction to anything we did. Our mojo is off the table. Which means...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh! So close. Means thanks to Cuddy's candy-ass approach, broad-spectrum antibiotics are no longer an option. This thing has grown horns and fangs. We gotta figure out what species it is. Go in with a spear to the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Okay, you guys are sulking. I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Tritter released our bank accounts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Horrible, horrible news. Wow! I'm glad we didn't let that fester. If she did have Reye's, then it could be varicella or associated...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> He released our money. You do know what that means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> The correct question is "How can it be varicella given that she's not itchy?".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Rickettsialpox causes rash, fever and muscle pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Pain, not paralysis. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, on the other hand, rash, fever, anaemia, paralysis and I didn't say anything to Tritter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I've seen House be rude a thousand times, usually to achieve something. I have never seen him be mean just because he can.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Nothing. Doesn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Well, I've seen House be rude to you a thousand times, but I've never seen it get it you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>People think House has no... inner censor. The fact is he holds himself back, because when he wants to hurt, he knows just where to poke a sharp stick.  I have been trying to get pregnant. And House knew. He told me I'm a failure as a mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>And you're this upset because... you think he's right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> I have had three separate implantations - the first two never took, the last one, I... lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I'm sorry. You didn't fail. Those were physical events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> A little girl is... scared and in pain. I was... awkward. Terrified of doing the wrong thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> That's normal. That's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I didn't hug her. I didn't even... reach out and hold her hand. I told her it was gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> She needed reassurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I told her her folks might get back together.  When I see people with their kids, it's so natural. It's like they have an instruction book imprinted on their genes.  Maybe I just didn't get a copy. Maybe my wanting to be a mother is like a... tone-deaf person wanting sing opera or a paraplegic who wants</content></utterance>
