<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content> Excuse me. I've been waiting here for over an hour. All I need is a refill on my migraine medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We'll get to you as soon as we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>You can get to me now. It'll only take you two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You're not an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>This isn't an emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And it's not gonna go any faster by pissing me off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No.  A routine checkup can wait. What else you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm consulting on some clinical trials that involve CNS compounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>While it's true that no sometimes means yes, in this context…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>One's a new Huntington’s drug. Phase three trials are showing real results delaying neuronal degeneration. Probably get you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> No, thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Are you doing anything about your disease, following any kind of program?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No. Nor am I looking for a consult.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk. Either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Do you know when she'll be back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Sorry. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice try. Love to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Shut up! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You wanted to see doctor —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I said shut up. I'm sick, and I want to know why. I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now… Or I'm gonna start killing people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What seems to be the problem?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> Close those blinds.  You, push the sofa in front of that door.  You, move that table in front of the other door.  Now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, we're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>House…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a bathroom you're barricading. It might come in handy, especially since you've cleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> Do it!  My medical records. I need you to read them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You really think that reenacting "Dog Day Afternoon" is the best way to get diagnosed? I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I've been to 16 doctors in the last two years. Had three full-body CTs and two MRIs, seven blood panels, and one homeopathic consult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And all that was missing was the threat of violence. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>What's missing is an answer! I can't breathe! I'm tired… all the time. I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a cool constellation of symptoms. It could be something minor. At least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Shut up and do your job.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You barely looked at the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No need. Symptoms — those are the things you keep whining about. Tests — negative, or you wouldn't be here. History — shy, quiet kid. Kept to himself. Collected comic books and missing children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sandra</speaker><content> I'll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict.  What kind of breathing problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Shortness of breath. And sharp pain when — when I inhale. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right? Me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health problem. Since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I've never been married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. Got a match?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I'll look in Cuddy's desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stay out of the desk! Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Mitch</speaker><content>No, I — I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. You just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Mitch</speaker><content> Look, sir, I've never smoked in my life, okay?  Jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Oliver</speaker><content>I'm sorry. It's just… I got a lighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out.  Decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain. An intermittent rash — could be 100 things. If you add on that final symptom, it can only be pulmonary scleroderma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>What final symptom? Those were all my symptoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last one is the 16 doctors who missed it. Simple alkylating agent, case solved. See you on visitor's day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Crime scene!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House, what's going on in there? Is everyone all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About to be. Assuming he's not lying. But he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me.  I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma. Then we all get to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Propofol? You sure —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have one of the guards bring it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>No, no guards. No cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Mitch</speaker><content>Uh, I'll go get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>No one is leaving.  She's not a cop? Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs. Alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She might be armed. I'd have her deliver it shirtless.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, God, House. Maybe we should wait for —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Guys with even bigger guns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who know how to talk to armed —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> Say good-bye or I shoot her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Roll up your sleeve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Give it to someone else first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're the only one who needs it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Give it to someone else. If it goes in okay, you can give a second dose to me. I don't care who. Just pick someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again, had your brilliant plan included a roomful of hostages that don't have fetuses, bacterial and fungal infections, leaving their immune systems too weak to deal with the metabolic strain, or are already on pain killers that have fatal interactions…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> He's not on pain killers. I heard him tell her in the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Aw, come on, man. Don't take it out on us. You got a problem with doctors? Take it out on the doctors.  Give it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's sick.  You are a very large creep. Take off your shirt.  Satisfied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Roll up your sleeve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You think I'm an idiot? Huh? That's what you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size.  You're not gonna do anything. You still need me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mitch</speaker><content>Hoh. Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you doing? He didn't do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You're right. I need you. I also need you to know you can't screw with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of Medicine. We just heard a gunshot, but I haven't been able to make contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content> We'll handle that once we secure our perimeter and set up our positions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>By "perimeters," I assume you mean snipers? We have to put an end to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Got a husband in there or a loved one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Don't worry, we'll decide when to start shooting. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>It's House.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's Foreman, and every fellow you've had in the last five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>This is pathetic. If I strap a bomb to my chest, do I get seven doctors attending to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Robert Chase. On the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Do you think he's the only guy in New Jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol? I'm not playing this game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously? You're walking out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, he's just kidding. He's right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Throw me that marker, will you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chest pain, the lung problems, fatigue, rash. Sounds like chronic lung infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Heart palpitations and fatigue — could be a cancer that's spread from the lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If his diaphragm's not working, maybe his nerves are freezing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Regina</speaker><content> I think he's going into shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The shortest distance between stomach pain and insomnia is bad circulation. Plus troubled breathing. Could be a heart defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>You needed to write four things down to remember 'em?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not my wall. You're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood. Run tests for infection and cancer. Cameron, comb through his medical records. See if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed up his heart. Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>873 Marshall, South Brunswick. Back window's unlocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Giving out your address. Clearly you're not going back there. Means you do have an end game.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>I'm Lieutenant Bowman. How's everyone doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious. Unfortunately, not the guy we hoped. We're gonna need someone to deliver his blood.  It's gonna be hard to play doctor —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Shut up.  Open that blind. Just a few inches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Nikki</speaker><content>Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Just open it. Open it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Nikki</speaker><content>Why me? Anyone can do it. Why pick me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Get back! Get back!  I will kill her unless you back the hell out of there now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. Anybody else hear those guys outside?  Anybody? He's got hyperacusis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means we have a favorite. It's nerve related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Puff out your cheeks. Come on.  Now big mug shot smile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Left side facial weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seventh nerve palsy. Plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines. It's post-herpetic neuralgia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Herpetic? You think I have herpes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not judging here. This thing is just as likely to be caused by chicken pox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I need proof now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There is a test. It's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless. But you make a good point. You need proof now. I'll order up the test. If you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>It only hurts if your diagnosis is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Win-win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Jason, don't hang up the phone again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You're gonna send in… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Capsaicin. 200 micrograms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>And two syringes this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>And we'll give you the blood and his records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>No more meds, Jason, and no deliveries without something in return. You've gotta give us a hostage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You can have two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Great. Then I'll send an officer right in with the transfer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Everything gets brought in by Dr. Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Jason, I'm not gonna let her do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First — don't use his name so much. It doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy. Second — come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication. He's gonna shoot the hostages if she doesn't bring it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>I'll get back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>The guy's demanding that you do all the transfers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What am I supposed to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You're supposed to say no. It's not your job. If you got a conflict here, if you have stakes in this that you're not telling me about, then I can’t trust you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Got it. I'm okay. Can you tell him I'm coming in now?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Who's taking the first dose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Anybody here got a long-standing case of neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Oliver</speaker><content>How bad does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're looking to be the hero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Oliver</speaker><content>Well, I've been beaten up a lot, and I can handle pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Regina</speaker><content>How old are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The guy's got a gun. I think that covers the parental consent issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Regina</speaker><content>And that stuff can also cause nerve and muscle damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Ah. No way am I taking that crap. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have to. It's the rules.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>With a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Everything's not some fascinating character flaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is a genetic flaw. This is your Huntington’s speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yes, I have a shortened life span. Another reason why I'm objectively the right choice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wow! I would have laid money you had herpes.  Your turn. So why are we here? We've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love. That just leaves… work? You're defined by your work. But you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time. Couldn't focus.  Maybe you made a huge mistake… got fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I just want an answer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I've got debt too — you don't see me acting like a lunatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There's no excuse for what he's doing, but you've got millions of people, thousands of dollars in debt because they're sick — At least one of them's gonna do something inexcusable. Especially if it works.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh-uh. Whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract. They don't discriminate against trigger fingers.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Don't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Get the damn paddles! Or I'll shoot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense. Actually doing it, not so much.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Humiliation? Doctors treating you like a piece of meat? Too many fingers and tubes up your holes. You hate doctors. You want to take back control. If so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not all. Curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You never did anything just because you had to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Never shot anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You're not me. This is my body. This is my life. And there's a truth out there. I'd rather rot in jail knowing than… I can't handle not knowing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He overpowered me and got the gun back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> You're a coward. You need to know everything because you're afraid to be wrong. You're so afraid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor, just another human being, that you'll risk other people's lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death. You just want to cheat it by making it come sooner. Gives you the illusion of control.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Whoa, whoa, whoa… We have a new symptom. He is turning his head, favoring his left ear. Means he's partially deaf in the right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We'll keep that between us till you talk to your lawyer.  I need dexamethasone and enough time to provoke a respiratory reaction and confirm Cushing’s syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content> You need more time? House, we're not negotiating with you. Actually, we're through negotiating.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those were not the terms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> I lied. These drugs could be fake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You wouldn't. They would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She has Huntington’s. If these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> The chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't do —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>How long do you have to live?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>So if we get out of here —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs.  Take a deep breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Not knowing what was wrong with me… made me miserable. Maybe that's insane. Doing this… Yeah. Insane. But I had something to gain. You can't take risks with no upside at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.  Heart's racing. Fever.  And your breathing's unchanged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Does that mean she…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We have to get her out of here.  The dexamethasone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the patient's — why?</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This guy's been on 50 different medications. Maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I need to slap you. For diagnostic purposes.  Seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin.  That twitch is Chvostek's sign. Don't ask me how Chvostek discovered it.  He has calcium deficiency. Drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years. He has something that has a long incubation period. Something that should have wrecked his kidneys. Something that explains breathing problems, heart problems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Leishmaniasis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would make perfect sense if our patient was an Arabian Bedouin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Melioidosis. Bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart. It explains everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except that if you read the history, you'd know that our patient has never been to a tropical climate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is he absolutely sure of that? Mexico. Costa Rica. You've never been —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I've never been anywhere south of Florida.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Florida counts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, not to the Supreme Court. But it's warm enough for germs.  You keep blaming doctors when you can't even give a halfway decent history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>Negotiation's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>Bowman</speaker><content>He comes out, he gets all the medicine he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>You can have Dr. House.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>No…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on, give 'em to me instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content> She's taken everything I've taken. The combination of meds could knock me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her kidneys are failing. You give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>I need my answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your obsession is gonna kill her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Your obsession gave me back the gun! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It is pointless to give her those drugs. Even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-29"><speaker>Jason</speaker><content>Only if you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-30"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> House, get out of here.</content></utterance>
