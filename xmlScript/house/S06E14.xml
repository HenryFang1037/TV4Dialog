<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Actually, I need to speed up. Rachel woke up early with a fever and she's been terrorizing me all morning.  I'm already late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Sorry, stakeout went longer than I thought. Have you ever been to a rave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> You're already late and Rachel's sick. Neither of which can be solved by you leaving right this second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The entire hospital is depending on a proposal I've yet to finish, and need to present at 8:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> It's 7:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's 7:37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I'll have you on the road in ten minutes. Come on, you don't want to go into your meeting all tight and stressed out, do you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>That's yours.  It's House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ignore it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>It says "emergency page."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I said ignore it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>I'm sorry. It's hard to pace yourself when you've been thinking about it for ten hours straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That's great. Now I'm late, stressed out, and frustrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Sorry. If you give me a minute, I can –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It'll wait.  You can do it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>I thought you were coming in at 7:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Rachel woke up with a fever and then I...Just couldn't get here any sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>There's a problem in the pharmacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, boss lady! You don't answer emergency pages anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Tell them all I'll be by as soon as I can and tell him  I assumed it was either about the wolf again or the procedure I refused to approve yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Turned out it wasn't a resistant staph, but I still say that if it had been, infecting him with malaria –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Seriously, House, I don't have time for this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have a meeting in 20 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not talking about your meeting. I'm talking about the phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I didn't ask what you were talking about, because I don't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I was with your boytoy on a stakeout last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You were with Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He needed someone who could diagnose a soft tissue injury from across the street. Apparently he doesn't know any good doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Or the ones he does know actually have lives outside of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Things got a little slow, so we made some wagers. One being whether I could get you to stop the miscegenation with an emergency page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What made you think we'd –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He said you guys do it every morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Everybody lies. Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you weren't actually –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Good-bye, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm gonna need a definitive answer before any money changes hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Sorry to interrupt, but the GRC called about the budgets, the pharmacy is still waiting, and your 8:30 just arrived on campus. He should be here in ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Figured this would be the one day he comes early.  Can you proofread this for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>When are you gonna find your own assistant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Not today. Thank you. I'll be back in five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Claudia</speaker><content> Dr. Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know we're usually fine with two CS reps, but I want a few extra hands today just in case. And have IT recheck the network. I don't want to hear later that the new lines can only dial out or the computer crashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Claudia</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Hopefully nothing. Just make sure you're ready if people start calling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You wanted to see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>Hey, Dr. Cuddy. Yeah, uh, I wanted to let you know there's a problem with one of the orders that came in last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>They sent double the amount of meds we ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you call and ask why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>Yeah. They insist it's not a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So fax them the original PO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>Yeah, that's what I was planning on doing, but, um... I can't find it. Actually, I can't find any of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oscar, I don't have time to straighten out your paperwork. Where's Stan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>He doesn't get in till 9:00 and it's actually not my paperwork. It's Gail's paperwork, and she's out sick today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So put it on her desk and let her figure it out when she comes back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>All right, but it's not my problem if –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oscar, not today, okay?  Was it the whole shipment or just one med?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>It's just one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Vicodin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>No, 25 milligram ephedrine tablets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Call Gail. Tell her I want to see her in my office ASAP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Oscar</speaker><content>But she's sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This place is full of sick people. Just get her in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content> Dr. Cuddy, your 8:30 is waiting in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, I got to make a quick trip upstairs.  Can you get the guy in my office a cup of coffee? I'll be right back.  I've gotten you coffee before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>It's freezing in here. I can hardly feel my fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Please tell me you didn't send a 911 page to tell me the heater's broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>It's not broken. House bribed the physical plant to turn on the AC so I'd hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>This man's abdomen is wide open. His core temp is down to 95.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Fine. I will deal with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Hourani</speaker><content>You better or I'm gonna file –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't care what he told you. Turn it back up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thought you had an important meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're an idiot. What are you gonna do the next time one of your patients needs a liver transplant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go talk to Wilson about something completely unrelated and see what happens. Mystery infection guy is now covered in boils and has an abscess big enough to put your fist in. He needs to get into an OR tout suite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Hourani will be done soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. I'll have some hot chocolate waiting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Marina, hey. How's she doing? She vomited? Give her some more ibuprofen and put her in the bath for a bit. And call me in a half an hour if it doesn't go down.  Sorry, Marina. I have another call. Just call me in a half an hour either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Hey. What's up? Tell him I'm halfway there. He's the one who insisted on the early meeting. I – all right, I'm coming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Morning Eli. Sorry about the wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content> Oh, it's all right. I hear you got a sick kid. Yeah, I know what that's like. Or, I should say my wife does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> So you guys ready to give some ground so we can make this deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Why would we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We've been going at this for eight months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Soon as you decide to get reasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm the one that's unreasonable? You've taken weeks to respond to every proposal I've presented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Atlanticnet Insurance is the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey, and you're not the only hospital whose contracts are up. So is your team ready to come back to the table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah. We're not going to.  This is our final offer. We're willing to go with a capitated structure, but we need at least 12% increase in reimbursements across the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Well, the good news is I can give you a quick response.  Not a chance. But as always, nice talking to you. Say hi to your sister for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you don't accept the offer, we're gonna terminate the contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Gonna be hard to keep this place open if all your patients have to pay cash. Princeton Plainsboro is the smallest hospital in our entire network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We're also the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Doesn't matter. We are responsible for covering 13 million people. We don't have enough cash to buy them all Maseratis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know what you paid Bergen, Newark Beth Israel, Robert Wood Johnson –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>'Cause they have leverage. You can be expensive or small, but you can't be both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I've engaged Jones/Curtin to handle the PR, and I'm prepared to make the announcement at 3:00 p.m. today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>First lesson every good poker player learns is don't get emotional. You don't have the cards. And the sooner you realize that, the sooner a reasonable contract will get signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have until 3:00 p.m. to change your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>I always did like your style. Gonna be sad to see you go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>They're waiting for you in the conference room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Thanks.  Uh, take this up to the call center and tell Claudia to give one to each CS rep and to start going over the answers to each question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And under no circumstances is any of this info to go outside that room. The scripts are numbered and I want a list of every person she gives one to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Got it. Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you really wanted to make a deal, you should have ditched the push-up and gone with a demi. Nothing makes a guy wanna close like high beams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What have you heard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your meeting with the weasel lasted less than five minutes, which means you either agreed to a completely sensible 30-day extension or one of you issued a completely ridiculous ultimatum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, goody. You or him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Way to go, boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You said it was ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ridiculous to make, fun to watch. As long as it's not just a bluff. Please tell me it's not a bluff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It is not a bluff, and it is not ridiculous. Just because we're not some huge –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Mr. Pluta started hallucinating before we could put him under.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>His BP is plummeting. He has an elevated heart rate. Looks like congestive heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I don't care how interesting it is. You are not infecting him with malaria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Since when is malaria a cure for heart failure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not. It's not congestive heart failure. It's gotta be...</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Dave. I don't really have time right now –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I took care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So you didn't want Chase, but now you're pissed you can't have him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, just refereeing a dispute about the OR. So, we don't yet have a contract with Atlanticnet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>We gave you an extra week and you assured us you'd have a deal by today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We could have a deal, just not the deal we deserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Female Board Member</speaker><content>So what do you want, approval for an extension?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We've been at this for eight months. An extension isn't gonna change anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>So what’s your plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I presented a final offer. I told them that we would agree to a capitated structure if they increase reimbursements by 12%.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Female Board Member</speaker><content>A final offer? What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If they don't accept it by 3:00, we're gonna terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We're not asking for anything they can't afford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>Their last offer was a 4% increase and you're demanding 12?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They're paying even more at some places. Units that have lower ratings than ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>In a perfect world, that would definitely matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sanford, they're all about growth, and they know they don't get new customers by marketing themselves as the biggest. They do it by claiming they're the best, and they can't do that if their patients can't come to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>What was  Morgan's reaction when you told him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He didn't give in, but he will. I told him I'd make the announcement at 3:00. He'll call back before then.  They need us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sanford</speaker><content>We need each other.  The negotiation is your responsibility, so we can't stop you if this is what you want to do. But just so we're clear, if we don't have a contract with Atlanticnet, you're not gonna have a contract with us.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Guess who didn't show up for clinic duty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Oh, don't tell me. The guy with all the boils needs a liver transplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>No, his doctor needs a nap. You want me to try to find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You really need him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>I need someone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>I have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why do you think you have cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>I don't think I have cancer. I know I have cancer. I had surgery to remove a malignant polyp in my colon six months ago, and now it's spread to my liver and lymph nodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So you're under the care of an oncologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Yeah, but he won't give me the prescription I need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Do you need more painkillers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>No. I need breast milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Human breast milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Yes. It has cancer-fighting qualities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, in newborns, it's been shown to reduce future risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>No, in adults with cancer too. I - I've read studies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Look... I even know a place where I can buy it. I just need a prescription so I can get reimbursed by my insurance company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They said they'd reimburse the cost of breast milk as a cancer treatment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>They reimburse prescriptions, so if you write me a prescription, then they have no choice but to pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, actually, they have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>What are you, some type of shill for the insurance company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Look, I've been paying premiums for 30 years, and I've never been sick a day in my life till this happened. Now I can't work, I got no money. And you want to help them screw me over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not screwing you over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Well, then give me the script.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It won't help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Will it hurt me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content>Okay, so it won't harm me, and it won't harm you, but it's this insurance company –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This is not about insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content> Then give me the damn script.  I'm sick. I need help. I need something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Clinic Patient</speaker><content> Bitch.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Yeah. The ER. They said the vascular who's on call doesn't have privileges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then why is he on call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Dowd's at a conference and got him to fill in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Be nice if he got somebody who can actually work here. Call Ereshefsky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Ereshefsky? She's not gonna do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She owes me a favor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why is he in my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Said he didn't want to sit around a bunch of sick people. I tried to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content> Ronald Westbrook. I appreciate your taking the time to meet with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hard to avoid since you're already in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Sorry about that, I just got over a wicked cold that didn't want to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>I represent Martín Acevedo. He's filed a suit against PPH, and Dr. Robert Chase for performing surgery without consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes, I saw that. I also saw the consent forms. They were all signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Yes, but my client was assured that the procedure would just be a few minor sutures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wait. Your client accidentally cut his thumb off with a table saw, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And Dr. Chase reattached it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're saying he didn't want it reattached?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>No, he most certainly did not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His insurance only covered 60% of inpatient expenses, so he would only agree to the cheapest option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So what did you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I said I'd sew up the skin over the exposed bone. Then I put him under, got his thumb from the paramedics, and reattached it. What's he gonna do? Tell the judge that I harmed him by reattaching a vital digit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Both he and the insurance company are suing to get out of paying the bill. It's over $80,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It was his thumb. I couldn't just let him toss it in the trash to save a few bucks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>You don't understand how hard it is. Ever since our second child, no matter what I do. I just wanted to lose ten more pounds and then I was gonna stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Forging pharmaceutical orders, stealing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy, please. I'm begging you. If Sam finds out, he'll divorce me for sure, and my kids – I will never do it again, I swear. Just give me a second chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I won't report the theft to the DEA... But I have to fire you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Just take a few minutes to compose yourself, then go down to HR and they'll give you your last check.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Got three hours to save this place from bankruptcy, I just fired one of my best employees, and the woman taking care of my sick child isn't returning my calls.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They'd never fire you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I just told Atlanticnet Insurance I'd terminate unless they gave us a 12% bump.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Marina, hey, it's me. I haven't heard back from you. Can you call me as soon as you can? Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What do you think I should do about Atlanticnet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're asking a guy who paid full sticker price for his last car. You ask House?  He's a master manipulator who always gets what he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This situation is out of control enough already. House is the last person I want to get involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Get out of my chair. And the answer is no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You ever noticed how many porn sites have "mom" in the domain name? Hot moms, hungry moms, mature moms. That ought to make you feel pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like boils, altered mental status, and heart failure was caused by renal cell carcinoma.  I need your signature to start treating it with malaria. Don't worry, I'm giving him chemo too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What is your sudden obsession with malaria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just trying to play my part cutting costs. Malaria is the simplest, cheapest method of delivering hypothermia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right. The only money you care about – You bet someone you could use malaria as a diagnostic tool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That doesn't sound like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, let me see if I've got this straight, a bet that puts one patient at minor risk is juvenile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And irresponsible and dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But going all-in against Atlanticnet –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is not a bet. That is a carefully considered negotiating position.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm gonna put this in your inbox. I just hope it doesn't get lost underneath all the other stuff you're carefully considering. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sure you didn't come looking for more people you could brag about our sex life to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> Okay. Sorry. From now on, I got nothing but bad things to say about our sex life.  Or nothing to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And what's going on with Marina? She hasn't called me back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>She was gonna call. I told her I'd let you know everything was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So her fever broke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>What exactly does that mean, "when a fever breaks?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Lucas, I'm very busy. Does she have a fever or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content> That was gonna be your lunch? And you didn't have breakfast either.  No, she doesn't have a fever, and the rash was just, like, a little diaper rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What rash? She has a rash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Little one.  Lisa, don't worry. I'm telling you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>Oh, god. I must have grabbed Marina's cell by mistake.  And, I turned the ringer off on the home phone so I could sleep.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>Lucas</speaker><content>How about I take a quick look into the guy who's in charge of the negotiations? Or better yet, the CEO. If I get some dirt, you can use it as leverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>There's no time.  How do you even find these guys?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content>That's me. How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, actually, I think we can help each other. I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of Medicine at Princeton Plainsboro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Well, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I'm a little unhappy. You're aware that our contract with your company is up this week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content>Yes, and we have a negotiating team that's working all that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Princeton Plainsboro has the highest-rated ER in the state, the most advanced ICU, and the most innovative diagnostic medicine department in the entire country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content>Good to know. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>While Atlanticnet Insurance has a marketing budget that's more than our pediatric ICU’s and transplant units combined. Your PGA sponsorship could pay for our walk-in clinic, and the money you spend to fuel your two private jets could fund our air ambulance service for the next three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content>Your point being?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your growth may be good for your bottom line, but ours allows us to save lives. And I would rather not have to announce to the press how selective your company appears to be when it comes to cutting costs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Tannenbaum</speaker><content> Morgan was right. You are one tough gal. You can portray me as a rich bastard in the press all you want, just as long as I stay rich.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Enough to tell me to get my ass back over here today.  Here. He's willing to go to 8%.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>8?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>We were at 4. Your board's gonna think you walk on water.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>You're not gonna get 12. There's just no way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>8% barely covers our cost inflation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>But capitated structure should allow you to hold down inflation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And shifts all your risk onto us, which is why we deserve 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Eli</speaker><content>Lisa, come on. The guy who mows my lawn makes more than my kid's teacher. Hell, the two guys whose lunch you interrupted could get fired, and their severance would be more than most of their employees make in a lifetime.

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>About the contract, with Atlanticnet. I got them to come up to 8%, but we should get at least 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's all numbers. Do the math, and nothing else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's not about my pride. It's about the principle. They're trying to screw us over because we're small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's what they're supposed to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>They should be pressuring other hospitals to be more like us, not trying to make us more like them. It's stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably. But then I also wanted to try to cure cancer by infecting a guy with malaria to win a $50 bet. You really want to be like me?</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As you know, for the past eight months, we've been trying to renegotiate our contract with Atlanticnet Insurance. It's been a difficult process, but I wanted to let you all know before we made the formal announcement, that as of 5:00 p.m. today, our contract with Atlanticnet will be terminated. We've doubled the number of customer service representatives in our call center. Current patients will still be allowed to remain in our care for 30 days, but starting tomorrow, we will no longer be accepting patients with Atlanticnet health insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Why weren't we told about this sooner?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hourani's not the problem. House is. Now he wants Chase to do the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>To prove to Hourani he doesn't need him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To prove to Thomas that Chase was his department's best surgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And what does Chase want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase wants to do the surgery.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't care who does it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So what's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>In order to get our patient into the OR, we have to get him on the surgery schedule. In order to do that, we need someone to put him there who neither House nor Thomas can overrule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you rather I go back on vicodin?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why am I the only person here who cares what happens to this hospital? Get off your ass and get your department under control. At least for the next few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Its gonna take longer than a few days for a company the size of Atlanticnet to start feeling the squeeze of your PR Campaign. If they ever do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And you know this how? From all the time you've spent researching them and their other contracts? The way they handle their press relations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know they have a nascar team. Despite what you may have learned at hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff, sometimes the bigger they are, The harder they kick your ass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mr. Acevedo, I am sorry you're having financial difficulties. But because of us, you still have a thumb. I assume that's something a carpenter might need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>And I assume you didn't ask for this meeting so you could lecture my client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You have insurance. But by filing this suit, you've caused us to get paid nothing by them either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>That's not our problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Actually it is, since he's responsible for any expense we're not reimbursed. But if you drop the suit and make it clear that Dr. Chase was acting in your best interest when he reattached your thumb, then we'll be able to resubmit the claim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>And you'll cover his deductible, attorney's fees, and 50 grand for pain and suffering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Actually, I was thinking more like we'd cover half his deductible, which means you'd only owe $16,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>You want him to pay you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes. Do you have any idea how much it costs? How many years it takes to train someone in microsurgery? We gave you back your life. You can still work. You can button your own shirt, hold a fork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Martín, let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You think you'd be in better shape without a thumb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, so would we. But when you came in, we didn't think about that, we just took care of you, made sure we did whatever you needed to get well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content>Yeah, right, all you doctors care about is healing.  That's why there are all those BMWs and Porsches in the parking lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>Westbrook</speaker><content> Come on, we're out of here.  We'll see you in court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're right, you will.  You still have a thumb because of us, and like everyone else in this world, we don't work for free. We earn this money. And if we have to take your house to get it, we will.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Out of my way. Now. Out of my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I told them to use their words.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>That pharm tech is back. She's in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> You, there.  You, over there. I don't wanna hear a word out of either one of you until I get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content> So? What're you gonna do about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Well, for one... Notify the DEA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>Good. I'm sure they'll be very interested to hear how Dr. House forced me to help him steal the meds and the administrator who he's having sex with has been helping him cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You really think you can lie your way out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. Anything else you wanna know... Bitch?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Tell him I'm busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>I did, but he –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then tell him I quit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You owe Lucas the money. We were having sex when you called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The breast milk guy finally found a doctor to give him what he wanted. If it works, it's way better than malaria. It’s worth a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I... I thought they were the ones bluffing. No way they'd let us terminate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're not gonna fire you. And you're not gonna quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you're an idiot.  This place needs you. And that matters to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What do you think of that pharm tech, Gail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's a sociopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You knew she was stealing meds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But have you seen the way she opens the mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why didn't you ever tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Figured it might come in handy one day.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Gail, I like you. I always have. And I know you must've gotten sucked up into a situation you weren't able to control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>Really, is that what happened with you and House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not gonna back down just because you threaten to smear me. Now, if you agree to tell the truth, there are things I can do to help. Think about your husband, your kids. I know you're a good person deep down inside. You can't completely hide everything about yourself in seven years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Gail</speaker><content>You're an idiot. I started stealing from here six months after you hired me. You still don't even know the half of it, and you never will. You wouldn't have even found out about this if I hadn't gotten sick. And you aren't as tough as you think you are. There's no way you'd let this job get taken away. And if I go down... You're going down.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Least I came out on top once today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Nurse Regina</speaker><content>Where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>To hand the board my resignation. Hopefully whoever they hire to replace me can still get the 8%.</content></utterance>
