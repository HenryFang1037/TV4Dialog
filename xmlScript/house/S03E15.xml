<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Would be hugely helpful. Somehow he got rewired as a music specialist. I wanna know how that happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He had access to parts of his brain that you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>His brains doing nothing. Looks like any jerk listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He's not savant at listening. He's a savant at playing. Both listening and playing are different neurological processes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Turn off the music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Patrick, I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>PATRICK</speaker><content> But it's not a piano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> I know. That's why I said "pretend".  Kid's a moron.  Keep your head still, use your fingers.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Cool, huh? His heart rate rose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Emotional response?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Then why is there no activity in the limbic system? Unless there's a problem in his heart. Do an echo to confirm. And scrub up. He's gonna need surgery.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> The chowder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Plane tickets, this Friday. I opened his mail. I heard there's an opening at Harvard for division chief, Infectious Disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Ambition's not one of his more prominent traits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Although...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He was testing blood in the clinic. Don't think it was the patient's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Why? It was green?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No, he was checking for routine stuff.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> He doesn't look sick. He should have symptoms. Blurred vision, headaches, confusion, clumsiness...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Depends on how far along the cancer is. What kind, how agressive? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>It was a heart problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>But no vasoconstriction. The heart problem couldn't have caused the hand problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Unless the bleed happened suddenly. Less blood to the brain explains dystonia. Less blood to the heart explains the heart attack. Scope him both above and below. If that doesn't work,  gut him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I could set up a tower on the roof during a lightning storm. Help you switch brains with your patient. Then you would be the brilliant pianist and he would be the doctor hiding brain cancer from his friend.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You need to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You need to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>At least, let me look at your medical file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You're making a big deal out of nothing. Who else knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> No one. And cancer isn't nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Sorry, didn't mean to offend your specialty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Why didn't you come to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Stein's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Stein's in Africa for the next six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He's given me at least six months. Go to Boston, get the treatment.  Everything will be fine. No need to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> You're right. Surgeon found a bleed behind the kidney and the retroperitoneal cavity, but no reason for it.  No cancer, no ruptured arteries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content> So bleeding explains the symptoms, but we've got no explanation for the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>And while they were closing him up, Patrick had a grand mal seizure... which makes no sense, since he's on an anti-convulsive medication.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Just wanna make sure you weren't misdiagnosed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I wasn't. Let's move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We're just asking for a couple of vials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, we're going to proceed as if I'm perfectly healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>How can we do that if we know you're not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You don't know anything! Except, hopefully, our patient on anti-convulsive medication has a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Anti-seizure meds don't prevent seizures, they just make them manageable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> According to the surgeon's report, this one wasn't even close to manageable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Means the question isn't why is he having seizures, it's why are his seizures getting worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What's changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>His brain, it's gotten worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why don't we make it even worser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> We take him off anti-convulsive medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He'll seize even more. Multiple seizures can seriously damage a brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Dude can't button a shirt. How much more damage are we really talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Strongest seizures will light up different parts of the brain, which will indicate response to damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Thank you for signing it. Saves me from having to fake your signature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Stay away from Weiss. He cries with his patients. Holds their hands as they die. He won't like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Your new-found nonchalance in the face of cancer.</content></utterance>
