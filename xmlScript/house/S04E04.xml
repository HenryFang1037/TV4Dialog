<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> FYI, if you ask me, it's more the guy's fault than yours. And House isn't blameless either. If he hadn't pitted us all against each other...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Was that always there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> Hello.  Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> It's House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Gooood morning, Angels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> As you will see from the file, we have quite the interesting case. Not often do you get a patient who sees dead people.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>What the hell? I gave it to Bosley a half hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>It was not a half hour. It was ten minutes. And he made copies of the ER records first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Less lip, more whip. I only agreed to take this case because you said that this Mocha Frappalicious would have whip on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>Fine. I'll refer the case to Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Can't. Mercy fired him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Gimme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>He got fired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Disobeyed a superior officer under fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>How do you know about it? You keeping tabs on him?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>When Bosley drags his ancient ass in there...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>I'm here. Twenty-four-year-old funeral cosmetician suffered a grand mal seizure at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Why does he get to be Bosley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> You wanna be Bosley? Bosley's like the asexual messenger boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>She had a vision of being raped by a cadaver before passing out. Seizure rules out psychiatric illness. No history of epilepsy, head trauma, or drug use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Bosley keeps his job while they replace five Angels over three seasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Could be a tumor to the temporal lobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Not with a normal CT scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>You mean it appeared normal to the doc in the ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Way to get right back on that horse, "Thirteen".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch. That was the worst "Thirteen" imitation I've ever heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Funeral home prep rooms are filled with toxic chemicals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>And cadavers. Everybody in that place obviously died from something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> I have a question. Is he the one who's not a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content> Bullets aren't contagious. But infections, parasites...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> You said one of us wasn't a doctor, and you called him a fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> He's not a doctor. Continue, Boz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>Could be an STD...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Why isn't he fired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Oh, you're breaking up. I'm going into a tunnel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Dark religious nut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>What did you call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I'm sorry. What do you people want to be called this week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>Cole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> I'm never gonna remember that. Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The rest of you young white people, the world is your oyster. Get an MRI with contrast, EEG, LP, and blood panel. And, Angels, be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>Just because he's religious doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You wanna bet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>No, I want you to stop being such a jerk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> One hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Smart call.  Guy's a wuss. He's gonna be the next one on the train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>Define "kick your ass."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Any physical confrontation...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>Or verbal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Define verbal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content>Anything over...seventy decibels. And you can't start suddenly being nice to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You realize what you're encouraging here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>ALLISON CAMERON</speaker><content> Yeah, someone kickin' your ass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CONNIE WALESA</speaker><content>Don't worry, Reena. The doctors are going to take good care of you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Once the Valium kicks in, you'll feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CONNIE WALESA</speaker><content>And then we'll have some nice, warm milk when you're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>IRENE WALESA</speaker><content>I'd rather have more Valium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CONNIE WALESA</speaker><content> Reena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Let's wait just a bit, see how it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Try to lie as still as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> I guess Father Time's a lock for one of the spots.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>He doesn't have a medical license and he's still around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>She killed a guy in a wheelchair. And his dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>He doesn't care about our qualifications or ideas. He just wants to have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>And she's the ultimate fun 'cause he can't figure her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>This game is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>So quit. Happy to lose the competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> If it's gonna be on your résumé, it's gotta be better to quit than get fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Either quit or shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Actually, with House, getting fired might look better.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> That's why I left. We had different ideas on how to practise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>To be honest, I don't think Dr. Schaffer really gave me a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Saved a patient's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> Have you spoken to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>Then why are you asking me what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content> What'd she tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ERIC FOREMAN</speaker><content>That's what happened. Nothing more I can add to that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> Cadavers were clean. So is her food. It's all organic unprocessed crap. It's gotta be the embalming fluid.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>Ethanol can have psychoactive effects...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Bosley! Tell whoever's talking he's an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Bosley. Either tell him he's an idiot, or tell me why I'm wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content> You're an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> You actually think that I'd take a patient who had a seizure in a funeral home if the ER hadn't already ruled out embalming fluid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>I thought we weren't supposed to trust...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Idiot! From the old French,  "idiote", meaning effeminate, mentally deficient moor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>I found something in the mortuary's files from '05. A forty-eight-year-old male's cause of death was listed as pneumonia, but the symptoms in the autopsy report didn't fit. Uh, confusion, memory loss, depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Mad cow. Very cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>No, she's a vegetarian and only ate organic vegetables at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Tell him he's an idiot again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content> The disease can be spread by brain tissue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Which is very cool. Run with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content> So because the answer might be "cool", you want us to do a brain biopsy on a twenty-four-year-old woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No, because the answer is something cool, I want you to do a brain biopsy on a forty-eight-year-old dead guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> The guy's already been buried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> We dig him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>I am not digging up a body without a court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Don't think of it as digging up a body. Think of it as keeping another one from being buried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>I can't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>We gonna have another one of those ecumenical discussions where I tell you that your beliefs are ridiculous and you totally cave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>I just gotta be home at six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>The Sabbath. The Lord works for six days, then tells the Union he needs a rest. You know, if I was all-powerful, I'd take at least two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, then it must be the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You have oatmeal on your pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>Do you have a camera in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>No. I was guessing. He had oatmeal on his pants yesterday and the day before. Have one of your wives look after the spawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>I'm a single dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Where's the single mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Interesting. You claim a lapse of judgment, or you gonna admit that a lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>He's gone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>Sexual harassment claims go through HR. Stress-related leaves through worker's comp, and any accusations of criminal activities go directly to the Princeton Plainsboro Police Department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Actually, I was wondering if you needed any extra help in the clinic tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content> You're not going to score any points with House by kissing my ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Understood. But I hear Dr. House hates clinic duty. If he were to hear through the grapevine that I was willing to work overtime, take some of it off his hands...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>My advice to you is to do whatever House wants you to do tonight. And then tomorrow night, you can come back and I will give you extra clinic duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Does everybody around here have trust issues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>I don't know what House wants you to do, and I don't want to know. But if you really have a problem with it, quit now. It's only gonna get worse.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>I'm a surgeon. If anything happens to these hands, I'm screwed. Let Bosley do it. As long as he can keep folding laundry, his career won't...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Shouldn't we be running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> If it's a cop, run. Security guard, I say we take him down.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Oh, I got lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> Been here over three hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Really lost. I brought coffee and donuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>So "Thirteen", you grow up around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>I'm just making conversation. It's what people do. Why are you hiding everything? And I'm asking you that question because you're hiding everything. There's something seriously wrong with you. I'm worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Fine, but I am freaked, because I don't think you're a freak. I think you're doing this on purpose because you know House will be intrigued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content> Honey, I'm home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>Get the crowbar.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You have a Grandpa Walt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope. Which is what made me suspect that maybe she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>What is this sudden obsession with the afterlife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Only obsession is with the idiots in the right-here-and-now life who think there's an afterlife. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>And you want me to...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Nothing. Just need a place to hang low for awhile. I'm pretending to be spooked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>Because...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead patient thinks that I believe her, maybe she'll let me chat with her mother's ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>The one you don't believe exists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion which most likely is the result of a hereditary disease that her mother died from when the patient was four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>And you think you can tap into her subconscious memory by tapping into her hallucination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hmm-mm. She might not know what caused her mother's death, but she will know how she acted before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>JAMES WILSON</speaker><content>You're quite impressed with yourself right now, aren't you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Yeah. There's a lot of blood in here. Sponge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>You got any advice for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>You always put up with this crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> Was it a mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>It was irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>He fired you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>He'll fire you either way... eventually.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>'Cause... House is watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>Not a metaphor. Look up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> You guys gonna shoot the breeze or you gonna do something about all that bleeding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>That's not coming from the spleen. It's the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>It's necrotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>ROBERT CHASE</speaker><content>She's dying from the inside out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Enlarged spleen and liver failure are classic AIP. It's porphyria and it's moving fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content> PBGs were negative. If you read the report...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> PBG tests are only conclusive if done during an attack, which you would know if you were a real doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>That is just great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>What is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>Which one of us is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Both of you. Together. Fighting. Passionate to prove the other one wrong. Couldn't care less about the patient, but it all works out the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> I hate "Thirteen".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Not as productively. Continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>It could still be vascular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> Vasculitis is off the board. Steroid treatment didn't help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>Vascular isn't just vasculitis. Something's gotta be cutting off the blood supply to her liver and spleen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Do a visceral angiogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content> This is a joke, right? He can't be right every single time. You're feeding him your ideas just to embarrass us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd... have you mop up the doctor's lounge.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>We couldn't finish. She started groping me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You couldn't let her get to second base just to get the test done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>I think that's third base.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>She was convulsing, delirious, and hyper-salivating. We had to knock her out with lorazepam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, it's definitely not vascular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>What do you want us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content> Question is, what would Joseph Smith do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>This isn't the time for...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Casting out the demons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> The patient's not possessed, she's dying. You can mock me tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You believe that the Book has all the answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> To morality, not science!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>But the book is inconsistent with science. You know how many epileptics were tortured because they were possessed? How many teenage witches were stoned to death 'cause they took mushrooms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> Just shut up already! We got a patient dying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Either got to prescribe an exorcism or admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>I know what she has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You couldn't have spoken up ten seconds ago? You coulda saved me a hundred bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> Mushrooms weren't the only thing that got people stoned to death. Jimsonweed, belladonna, mandrake root, and... moldy bread. It's ergot poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content>... completely unprocessed and untreated like what's in that organic rye bread she's been eating.  Should I be going home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Is it six o'clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>It's why she got worse on the bromocriptine. It's an ergot derivative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>TRAVIS BRENNAN</speaker><content>There hasn't been a case in fifty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>She kept asking for milk. Dairy products counteract the effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>Cravings based on actual needs. It's a fairly common evolutionary development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>You okay with an answer based on evolution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Hypocrite.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>IRENE WALESA</speaker><content>She's not here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content>The fact that you're even willing to accept that answer means the medicine is starting to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CONNIE WALESA</speaker><content>But you'll live. You're beautiful, Reena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>IRENE WALESA</speaker><content> You too, mama.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>LAWRENCE KUTNER</speaker><content>But I'm sure they're part of the rose family. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Actually, I'm surprised there are seven of you.  You punch your boss and stick around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>JEFFREY COLE</speaker><content> Gimme the flower and shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Don't overdo it.  Now I would love to keep all of you. But not enough to do anything about it. So according to my arbitrary schedule, one of you has to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> You're kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> I came up with the answer. I robbed a grave. I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>AMBER VOLAKIS</speaker><content> No, I never...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm sure she did it. That's why she's getting the flower. It was beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She just overreached. She got into your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>She owned you. Planting the idea was good. Letting it fester was good. Leaving the collar was stupid. Well known fact, ghosts don't leave things lying around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness. I'd totally forgotten about you two. Well played.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Sorry, Henry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>We had some giggles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CHRIS TAUB</speaker><content>You agreed with everything he said. You finished each other's sentences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content>That's why I gotta go. Don't need someone to tell you what you're already thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>Funny, I was gonna say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>GREG HOUSE</speaker><content>If you want to hang out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>HENRY DOBSON</speaker><content> Yeah, I know. Um, call Wilson.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>LISA CUDDY</speaker><content>You haven't rethought anything. You've just been blackballed. You're "House Lite" now. The only administrator that will touch you is the one who hired "House Classic".  Good news is, she'll pretend she's not doing you a favor.</content></utterance>
