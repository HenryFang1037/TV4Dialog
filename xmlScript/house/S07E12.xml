<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content> I'm afraid the teriyaki chicken's no longer on the menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. That's what you had last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Wife</speaker><content>We've never been here before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>I definitely remember you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content> Your hair was lighter. You had little round glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content> Sounds like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Wife</speaker><content>Henry, don't play along. It's a gimmick, for tips.  Could we get some water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>It was last August. Saturday, the 14th. You were wearing a blue dress with polka dots. Your eyes were puffy, like you'd been crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>The 14th is Darren's birthday. You said he had to cancel his party 'cause his old girlfriend showed up. They got into a huge fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Wife</speaker><content>Henry…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Henry</speaker><content>I knew it. Damn it. Ever since that ski trip when the two of you disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>I'll go… get your water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Are you all right? Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>I can't move my legs!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Picture a door. Unlocked with the key of the mind. Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>That actually makes no logical sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up.  Case number one. 33-year-old woman named…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Something I can't remember. You'll see the irony in a second. Presenting with temporary paralysis, high CK levels, and a perfect memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How perfect is perfect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfectly perfect. Hyperthymesia. Complete recall of every moment of every day since puberty. All 7,600,049 of them. It's cool, huh? One of only a handful of recorded cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So we have two symptoms: Temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition 'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover. There's a third symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her memory's unrelated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Why? It's a strange medical phenomenon—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hyperthymesia is known to manifest in adolescence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, in the whole five documented cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To be related, it would mean 20 years between symptoms. Plus, I don't know of any diseases that cause great memory, only ones that destroy it. MRI showed no evidence of stroke or tumor, so probably a toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She's a waitress. They're no strangers to botulism or alcoholism. We should search the diner and where she lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or you could search her brain. You know, where her memory lives. Save the gas.  You two check her home.  You two get a complete patient history. We'll see who gets an answer first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You said there's a second case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh! Yeah. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The case of the 45-year-old doctor who just failed his pathology recertification exam and is going to lose his board certification and get fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How'd you fail it? You spend half your life in the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was recovering from the flu. I'm retaking it next week. It's not an issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Normally, I'd let Darwinism run its course. But Cuddy's in a big tizzy about her poster boy getting canned. So, how are we gonna get the short guy off the short bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>What about a tutor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I don't need a tutor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tutor it is. Choose your poison. Chase, if you prefer pounding Aussie beers and commiserating over the suckiness of divorce. Masters, if you want nervous energy, flash cards, and obnoxious pieces of arcane trivia. Foreman, if you need to be berated by a humorless hard-ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a consult, Dr. Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> So call me in a week if it still itches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Patient</speaker><content>Thank you. And be sure to give Sarah a kiss for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Will do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's Sarah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Her granddaughter, I think. Early stages of dementia. What's the consult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need your medical opinion on what bar we're gonna hit for happy hour tonight to kick off the official end to your three-month pity party over Sam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I can't tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because of Sarah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, because of my senile patient's granddaughter. You caught me. I'm busy! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who's Sarah? Wilson's friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My computer crashed. Lost my database of his acquaintances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or you're both lying to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I know nothing about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Satisfied? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nooo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> What are the eight types of vomitus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I could show you four right now if you ask me one more review question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, you picked me. You said you wanted a hard-ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>No, House said that. I pretended to agree to get him off my back. I picked you because I wanted the guy who doesn't like getting involved in other people's problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Yes, I thought you'd want to skip the massive public humiliation of getting fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> By treating me like I'm an imbecile? I'm totally fine. I aced my first pathology boards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Medicine has come a long way in the last hundred years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You know… I heard of a guy, who knew a guy, who could get the exam ahead of time.  It was something I heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Patient's file said she lost some weight on a new diet, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, she went vegan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Are laxatives vegan?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the parking garage, searching Wilson's car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We have an answer. Magnesium poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We found a pretty large stash of laxatives. Abuse can lead to hypermagnesemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I admit that's… impressively outside-the-box thinking.  Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House. You still there, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. For a second I thought Wilson might have a drug problem. Turns out it's much, much worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Okay… Uh, so we push fluids and wait for her kidneys to clear the hypermagnesemia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has. Her BP and respiratory rate are normal. While you two were so busy being impressively outside the box, you missed the actual box. Chase and Masters done yet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Two light beers, November 16th. One really bad glass of Pinot on the 17th. Uh, nothing from the 18th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Shouldn't you be working for NASA or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>You mean why am I just a waitress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>No, I didn't mean… I'm sorry, I-I-I-I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>It's okay. Remembering something is not the same as understanding it. I'm not a genius. I love my job. I'm great at it. Keeps my mind busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I'm Dr. House. You are not pooping. Question is, are you also a klutz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Uh… I guess I'm no clumsier than most people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you guessing for? You've got a perfect memory. I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>What do you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's go back to 2008. How many trips, stumbles, falls did you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content> Eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This really works. Cool. How 'bout 2009?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Twelve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Even cooler. Last year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That's a big spike in discoordination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's. Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, I'm so surprised you broke into my apartment without telling me. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>An intervention.  Exhibit A. A baggie filled with nepeta cataria, also known as…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> That had better not be what I think it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you mean your new junkie girlfriend, then yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Okay, fine. I got a cat. Release the Kraken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't think you appreciate the severity of your situation. You are rapidly approaching an end-stage male spinsterism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That cat, that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with Insulin and buying dime bags of catnip for, that means you've given up on ever finding anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Don't you think you're completely overreacting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Um, because I knew you would completely overreact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Its name's Sarah. Cats aren't named that, women are. What the Freud is that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Look, I didn't name her. My neighbor did. She died, and I felt bad. Sarah would have been destroyed at the shelter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Aww, who would want a cat that croaks if you're not home twice a day to shoot it up? It's like having your own button on Lost.  You know, I'm pretty sure that there is a river nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm keeping her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Okay, shrug your shoulders and don't let me push them down. So I have to ask, uh… is there a trick you use? Mnemonics? Meditation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>No, no tricks. I don't even try, really. It's just there. Is my memory gonna go away… with the Parkinson's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's quite possible. But we still have a lot of tests to do before we have a definitive diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Well, here's hoping for cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Nadia? Your boss called me. Sorry, um… I'm Elena, Nadia's older sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>You don't have to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>But I'd like to pretend you'd visit me if I were in a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>You brought daisies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>They're your favorite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>No, they're my least favorite. I was stung in the face six times by —  Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>My heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fast, wide-complex rhythm. Get the paddles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cardiac involvement rules out Parkinson's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We're back to transient paralysis and high CK, plus arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Masters, when you finally blossom into a woman, would you ever sleep with a man who had a cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wrong, the answer is no. Slut. Any of you ever had a cat?  Any of you ever had sex?  I think, as your people say, quod erat demonstrandum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>An excess of catecholamine could set off an arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not a pheo. Her blood pressure's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Maybe we're missing the obvious. The heart could be behind everything. If it's not pumping effectively, the muscles shut down, CK elevates, coordination suffers. Why are you asking about cats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Curiosity.  Can we focus here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Uh, her heart problems started when Nadia saw her sister. Stress-induced arrhythmia could be caused by long QT syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her sister was barely in the room five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>She said they'd been estranged for over six years. That's a lot of tension.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Run a stress test to confirm long QT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It'll have to be drug-induced. Treadmill will pull her stitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Drugs are never the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You lied to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> No. I said I didn't know anything about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Under House rules, that is not a lie. He's lonely. That cat is a nice way for him to get some affection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from. He needs a putty tat he can tap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why is it so important to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged Siamese. He stopped answering his phone, redecorated his place like Grey Gardens. He wasn't able to come back to humanity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open. How that cat opened the window, I will never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He just needs more time. Leave him and the cat alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I won't if you will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Sorry about the daisies. I always get it confused if you love or hate them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Do you want to know exactly how many times told you that I hate them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>I didn't do it on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Her heart rate isn't moving. The sister stress pot needs stirring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You want me to start a fight? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Just agitate a little. Use something from the history. You're not lying to them. In fact, you'd be telling the truth, and serving their medical needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You haven't seen each other in a while, huh?  I heard the story about the time you hit Nadia with the car. It must have been pretty scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Why would you tell them that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>They asked about broken bones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>I swear that I checked my mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>You know that's a lie. You knew I was getting the mail, and you just didn't care enough to check! Just like you didn't care that you ruined my 23rd birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Nadia, don't start!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>You started by coming here, acting like you give a crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Here we go again! I'm such a monster because I brought daisies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> You-you need to leave right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Well is she gonna be ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>Elena, get out!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You said you'd be ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I couldn't decide on the cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When are you getting an apartment? Or at least a storage room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I'll get to it. I like it here. They have video on demand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I pulled a practice test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I hate practice tests. Hey, I never saw The Usual Suspects. You wanna check it out before we start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What are you doing? You've got three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why is everyone's first assumption I'm gonna fail this stupid test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe, because you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I was recovering from the flu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don't care if you were dying from ebola. You shouldn't have gotten less than a 70. You're nothing but excuses and distractions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well it's a nice match with your condescension and superiority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Enjoy the movie. Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>How is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We started her on a beta blocker. It should keep her heart rhythm under control. She'll be fine while we run more tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>Did you hear that she banned me from her room? I know I'm not perfect, but she's… Oh, she can be such a bitch. She never ever, ever lets anything go. Look, tell Nadia she doesn't need to worry about seeing me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content> I started the fight. We needed her heart rate to rise, so I provoked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>You can't play with people like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Maybe if I explain to Nadia—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Elena</speaker><content>No, it doesn't matter! It's just one more fight for her to remember. Guess you're both bitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Masters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Smell her breath.   Breathe out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Ammonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I think your kidneys are shutting down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Failing kidneys puts the heart back on the list as a symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe she went vegan because she lost the taste for protein. It could be Amyloidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We would have seen a stiff heart on the nuclear study. But autoimmune could account for multiple organ systems and paralysis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Why are you giving me these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because, while they're off running all these tests, you will be submitting the insurance forms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There's an entire department for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. The Foreman department. Of which you are the foreman, Foreman. I know you got the time. A little Wallaby told me that you recently vacated your post as Taub's savior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're worse than Masters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>How's this my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn't need a tutor. He needs Ritalin and a babysitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Consider the forms incentive. Taub doesn't pass, he'll become a permanent part of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This isn't really about Cuddy, is it? It's about you. You don't want to lose me. I think you care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't think you can disgust me into pulling Foreman off you. Pulse the patient with steroids for the autoimmune. Start her on dialysis for the kidney failure. Treat the Taub with insults and small slaps for the obstinacy, and start him on studying for the brain failure. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'm not paranoid. I'm allergic to ragweed and dandelion. I'm not allergic to cats. You're trying to gaslight me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe your subconscious is afraid that you're gonna die alone. And it just comes out as gibberish and sneezing. Prove that I'm overreacting.

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, we all hold our grudges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>It's not a grudge. It's common sense. It's simple math. She's hurt me more than she's helped me. Most people edit their memories. They add small, little lies so they don't have to face the truth. My memories remain the same. My truth never changes, because… my truth is the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So no one ever gets forgiven? Sounds like a lonely way to live.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He tells me he's working with our Uncle in Florida.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He tells you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don't look at or touch anything that doesn't belong to you, including food. You will study and you will sleep. And you will not leave my sight until the exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Great, I'll be back bright and early tomorrow, and—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This is no longer just about your future. It's about mine too. You fail, and I will kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Respiratory distress means we were wrong about autoimmune.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think this is an allergic reaction? It can't be. We pumped her full of steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have good news and bad news. The good news is I was right about you having some autoimmune disease. You're just allergic to the dialysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>Nadia</speaker><content>But if I can't have dialysis and my kidneys are failing, won't that mean I'll die?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We look for another case. Even if you're right about autoimmune, we now don't have time to prove it. The transplant board will never give her a kidney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Maybe we could go around them, get a relative to donate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which relative? The sister who walked away and told you she was never coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>We caused this, you know. They were estranged, but we made it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>That relationship was broken long before we got there. Nadia literally keeps score. She tallies everything.  She decided Elena's done more bad things to her than good, doesn't deserve her affection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm sure she's right. Unlike everybody else in the world, her memory seems to let her keep a pure and objective view of people in relationships. There's no petty</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>'Cause it's making her die alone of kidney failure in room 205?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not necessarily. Nadia's sister's not like her. I'm sure she's got plenty of subjective emotions we can exploit. Why don't you go channel your guilt, see if you can get her to cough up a kidney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Me? I'm not good at that type of thing. Someone else should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone else didn't screw this up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You make life and death decisions every day. You work for House. You're under constant pressure, and you never choke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I got a perfect score on my first pathology boards. I kept thinking, whatever my score is now, it's going to be a measure of the distance between me and the man</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Well, the last test was before I lost my wife and my home, so I'm sure the next one will go much better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If she's telling the truth. She claims she objectively sees reality. Weighing the good and bad in people. If that's true, I don't care how many times her sister borrowed her scrunchie without asking, a free kidney ought to trump all the bad stuff.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That means she sucks like the rest of us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not about the cheating. It's about your confidence. You steal that test, and you'll never get it back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're a good doctor. I've seen what you're capable of. You're fast, you're decisive, and you're bold. And those are not the qualities of someone who needs to steal a test. There's nothing on it that you don't already know. You just need to know that you know it.</content></utterance>
