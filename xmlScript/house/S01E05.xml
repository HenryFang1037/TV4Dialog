<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fourth circle of Hell. Charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate the whole of classic poetry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. Pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re over two weeks behind on your charting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oops. I missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What are you, eight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could an eight-year-old do this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You better stop or it’ll stick that way. You have a patient in Exam Room 1.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but see, see, I’m off at twelve and it’s already five of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’s been waiting for you since eleven. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Dr. House. What seems to be the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler. You been washing a lot of dishes recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anything new in the kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Should have spent your time saving souls, it’s easier on the hands. This is contact dermatitis; you’re allergic to dish soap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve been a doctor for years. Why do I have to keep assuring people that I know what I’m doing? A person can become allergic to substances that they’ve had repeated and prolonged exposure to. The good news is: free samples. Diphenhydramine. It’s an antihistamine. It’ll stop the allergic reaction. Take one every eight hours, it might make you feel a little sleepy. And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want some water? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, you just relax for a few minutes. That stuff works pretty fast. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Still out by twelve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do you solve a problem like dermatitis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She talking to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t know. She’s certainly looking at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you don’t? Then you’re wearing an awfully funny hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oooh, boy. Excuse me. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Lift up your chin.  Sister, you’re having an asthma attack. I need you to relax.  Roll up her sleeve, please.  I’m giving you epinephrine, it’ll open your lungs and help you breathe. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did she take the pill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s probably an allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You figure somebody’s out to get her? How’re you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll put you on some steroids instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast.  But not this fast.  Get a nurse, please. Lie back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Somebody get in here!  Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She’s got no pulse. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You diagnosed the patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine, she went into respiratory distress, and you injected her with epinephrine. Presumably 1 cc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>People don’t go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s too bad you didn’t make a notation in the chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can make it up right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The drawer has syringes with both dosages, you could have easily reached for the wrong one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Everyone makes mistakes. This is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax, they’re not going to sue. Worse they’d do is whack my hand with a ruler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And the discipline board? Are they gonna whack your hand, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re going to report me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What choice do I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, how ‘bout not report me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I can justify keeping her here for 24-hour observation. If you haven’t found an underlying cause for the cardiac arrest by then I will have to notify our attorneys. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her hands were red and swollen, maybe she has a skin infection. Cellulitis? That could manifest with tachycardia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no history of fever. Results from the CBC didn’t indicate an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate’s up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not allergic. Allergies don’t cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Vasculitis? That wouldn’t give you an elevated eosinophil count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart problems. Covers all her symptoms. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Need a biopsy to diagnose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Chest CT’d be quicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The lady just came in with a rash. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What the hell are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Candy canes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Candy canes? Are you mocking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No! It’s Christmas and, and I, I, I thought –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax. It’s a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Isn’t the prognosis for Churg-Strauss a bit grim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah. Untreated only 33% of patients survive past a year; treated, five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then I’d definitely suggest treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If it was any other attending doctor, I’d say that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Saying you wouldn’t say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Everyone screws up: your rule. I think you fit inside the subset of “everyone”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn’t screw up.  Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, didn’t I mention? The patient’s a nun. Sister Augustine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Aw. I hate nuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Who doesn’t?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sister Augustine? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>We weren’t watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Pius</speaker><content> We were trying to see if this was the bed control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh, um, this one’s the bed control  and that one’s the TV control. I’m Dr. Cameron, and that’s Dr. Chase and Dr. Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I hadn’t seen television in over twenty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Do you consider it the work of the devil, or do you just not get cable where you live? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Um, how’re you feeling, Sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I seem to be a little better; they gave me some medication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Prednisone. It’s a steroid to help with the inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Has Dr. House figured out what I have? Will I be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re not sure what’s wrong yet. You’ll have a chest CT scan this afternoon that will help with the diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Pius</speaker><content>Dr. House is giving her medication and he doesn’t know what she has yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Trust, Sister Pius. It all happens for a reason.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He doesn’t know what he’s doing. The only problem that woman has is that House grabbed the wrong syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You don’t trust him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t trust a man who won’t admit he might be wrong. I notice you weren’t so quick to tell her she has Churg-Strauss and only has a couple years to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t tell patients bad news unless it’s conclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Because you know he might be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>About Churg-Strauss, not about what happened in the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about you, Chase? You think he’s infallible, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All I know is, if House didn’t make a mistake and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss, he’ll be self-satisfied and our lives will be good for a few weeks. If House did make a mistake, he’ll be upset and our lives will be miserable for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There is that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She doesn’t confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am human and capable of error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you might have screwed this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So, it’s only a theoretical capacity for error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good point. Maybe there isn’t one. Maybe that’s my error.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know, most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Most people don’t like to listen, so what’s wrong with you? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let me guess… inflammatory bowel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes. It’s also written on your chart. Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain… took sulfasalazine, but it didn’t work –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>No, then I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine… I’m impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>By my medical history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By how well your last doctor charted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>It’s one thing to have to go to the bathroom every hour, but when the kids sit on my lap, it’s…. The store sent me home, they’re gonna fire me. Can’t you put me back on 5ASA? Maybe it’ll work this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not likely. I’m giving you a prescription. It’s cheap, which is good because your insurance company won’t pay for it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content> Cojorius?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cigarettes. One twice a day, no more, no less. Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is one of the most effective ways to control inflammatory bowel, plus it’s been established that you look 30% cooler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About the looking cooler, yeah. The rest is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>Isn’t it addictive and dangerous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it’s completely legal.  Merry Christmas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I was talking to the nurse, Arsenio. Do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>He can take pictures with his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>That woman from the lab was interesting, too. She studied astrophysics before becoming a nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You know the staff better than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Well, I love to hear about people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yet you live in a monastery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>It’s where I serve our Lord and the world best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Our Lord, maybe. The rest of the world, on the other hand, would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Healing the sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>As an example, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Did you always want to be a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Always. You always want to be a nun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>My parents died when I was six. I was raised in a foster home run by the Church. When I was eighteen, I went to the monastery where they let me take my vows. I’ve known no other life and I haven’t wanted to.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay, Sister, we need to you lie as still as possible. If you get scared, just let us know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>As Jonah said from inside the whale, “When I had lost all hope, I turned my thoughts to the Lord.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>At least she’s got God on her side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t believe in God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re not even a little agnostic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content> Is it supposed to smell funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Tech</speaker><content>Someone ralphed in there this afternoon. We cleaned it up, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s normal, Sister. It’s just a few more minutes.  I believe in a higher order that’s in control of what happens, but not one anthropomorphic entity called “God” that’s concerned with the everyday workings of you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What else is there to control but the everyday workings of you and me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s always about you, Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What else are you talking about? The trees, the fish? Should they be the ones to think it’s all about them? What about you, Chase? Do you believe in God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I believe Sister Augustine has no vascular pathology, which means no Churg-Strauss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which means House made a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, not necessarily. It could be something else. Thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t get you. You don’t believe in God, but you’re willing to put complete faith in one man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Please, the smell!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let’s get her out of there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m coming, Sister. I gotcha, I’m coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Please, please, the smell, I’m sick –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s no smell –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>No, God, no –  Oh, it’s Jesus! It’s Jesus!  He’s coming for me. He’s burning me with his touch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let’s get her on some Ativan.  Smells, religious visions are symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling. We don’t want her to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s seizing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Help me get her on her side. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Religious visions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. And next comes… </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what’s that tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her immune system is severely compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ooh, I know! Prednisone compromises the immune system. Isn’t that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn’t have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, but… hey. I’m think that’s a trick question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her immune system is severely compromised. Two doses of prednisone wouldn’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In ten seconds I’m gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re gonna admit negligence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless you leave the room. If you stay you’ll have to testify.  Five, four, three, two…. So, there I was in the clinic, drunk. I open the drawer, close my eyes, take the first syringe I can find –  So, what are the options for compromised immune system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mixed connective tissue disease. It’d explain why she was feeling better on the prednisone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sure, she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary problems, cardiac problems – it all fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Except her ANA was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So redraw the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>But the treatment is corticosteroids, prednisone, and we can’t go there because of the encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then we’ll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn’t suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chamber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no protocol for putting a patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, you people. Always with the protocols.  Prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone.  I am both amused and annoyed that you think I should be less stubborn than you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The one that starts: First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone. Yeah, took a read once, wasn’t impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Every treatment has its dangers –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is why we treat when we’re only convinced the patient needs the treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m convinced. You’re not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I have an opening Thursday at three. Do you have a fourth? Is he any good?  Can I call you right back? Okay.  What’s up? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The pressure will force the oxygen into your system and saturate your blood. It will enhance white cell activity and reduce the inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>And that will help with this mixed connective tissue disease?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody’s ever here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content>I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine believes in things that aren’t real.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content>She’s been known to lie to get sympathy. She’s a hypochondriac.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content>Sore throats, joint pains… there’s always something wrong, and there’s never a reason for it. Mother Superior plays right into it. Lets Augustine off work duties, treating her as fragile, special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That must make you angry. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content> Mm hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, we’ve got pride, anger, envy, gluttony…. That’s four out of seven deadly sins in two minutes. Do you people keep records of these things? Is there a Cathlympics?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s pretty stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content>And you make jokes because you’re afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter, and if they matter –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I’m not tough, I’m vulnerable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Eucharist</speaker><content>I barely know you, and I don’t know if I’m right. I just hope I am. Because the alternative is, you really are as miserable as you seem to be. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, yeah. I’d like to clear my reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, right. I forgot that you care about what people think. Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? It could cause lung cancer, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They ran out of colors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s because people blame lung cancer patients. They smoked, they screwed up, they deserve to die. The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. Well, guilt does a lot of damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said that with great significance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re not here to find your stethoscope. You’re not here to clear your reputation. You’re here because you’re having doubts. You might have screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m here because, if I’m right, Cuddy is killing that patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, but if you’re wrong? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then she’s saving her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Fine.

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The cute one. I think she likes me. The sick one, obviously.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s she lying about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why do you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don’t know nuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You hate nuns. You can’t hate someone if you don’t know them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have a theory on what makes good boys “good”. It’s not because of some moral imperative. Good boys have the fear of God put into them. Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training, to make good boys afraid of divine retribution so they will do what their daddies tell them, like, for example, going into medical school when it’s the last thing they want to do. What do you think?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Any way she could have got access to drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Well, we lock all of our medications in the infirmary, and we don’t keep prescription drugs here.  Why haven’t you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is probably the last person you should ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Ah. And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I’d have her repeat a year of nun school. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Becoming a nun doesn’t make you a saint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Becoming a doctor doesn’t make you a healer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer doesn’t mean we don’t find time for drama.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what is the sick one’s drama?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us.  Tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure. Do all of you lie? It’s a good strategy, simpler when you all tell the same lie, but she has not spent her entire life as a good Catholic. When she had a cardiac arrest I had to open her blouse to do CPR and I learned two things: nuns can have nice breasts, and she has a tattoo on her shoulder of a skunk. Now, maybe it’s the Sacred Skunk of Joseph, but as far as I know, Catholic foster care and monasteries do not keep tattoo parlors in their refractories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>We consider that our life begins when we put on our habits and take our vows. What happens before then –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is irrelevant to you, but it’s relevant to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Nun</speaker><content>Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old, but she left when she was twelve. She lived on the streets, she got into drugs. When she was fifteen, she became pregnant, tried to self-abort. She lost the child, she became ill. We took her in when she came back. If we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not.  This tea is delicious. Local herbs?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Any change with medication?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s getting worse. Lung function’s deteriorating, BUN and creatinine are continuing to rise. She’s starting to run a fever and the rash is spreading. At this rate she’s not going to make Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe House was right. Maybe there is an underlying condition that explains the symptoms, something we haven’t considered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be a metabolic disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Specifically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Mitogenetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Specifically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m just saying –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re just saying you think House is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Might be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Of course he might be right! It might be the Hand of God at work. Don’t say it’s something else unless you’ve got something concrete to offer.  What’s this, hemlock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“I’m going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another. I’m gonna stop you from killing your patient.” It’s figwort tea. Great for that little pick-me-up we’re all looking for in the morning. Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart. Unfortunately, if you then get injected with even 0.1 cc of epinephrine: instant cardiac arrest. Still, what the hell, it tastes great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Sister Augustine –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe long-term allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s what Cameron said in the beginning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, she did. Well done.  But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost killed this woman.  Take a lesson from Foreman: stand up for what you believe. Okay, let’s go figure out how to save a nun. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because it’s been untreated for so long, it’s gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I’m-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems. So, what’s the source?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The dish soap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode. It’s gotta be something she’s been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be, but it’s not definitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ll skin test for allergens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not yet, she’s too reactive. She’d test positive for everything. We need to stabilize her, isolate her from all possible allergens. Give her system a rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get her in a clean room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. And we’ll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we’ll know that’s what killing her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Can the other sisters come in and pray with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’d be better if you don’t have any visitors. Once we isolate what’s causing your allergy, then we can be a little more lax.  I can pray with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I want to die. Why has He left me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was in seminary school. They asked us once what our favorite passage was. I chose 1 Peter 1:7. “These trials only test your faith to see whether or not it is strong and pure. Your faith is being tested as fire tests gold and purifies it.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>“And your faith is far more precious to the Lord than pure gold; so if your faith remains strong after being tested, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day of His return.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He hasn’t left you. The only thing in the way of your knowing if he’s left you is your fear. You have a choice: faith or fear. That’s the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Do you think faith doesn’t mean I won’t die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It will affect how you experience your death, and therefore your life. It’s up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Why did you leave seminary school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>A test. You passed. I didn’t.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t need verification from you to know that I’m doing my job well. That’s your problem, not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I was just being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you don’t need to always do that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Merry Christmas. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sister Augustine’s been extubated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s requested to check out against medical advice. She wants to go back to the monastery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, talk her out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I think I may have talked her into it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Room’s paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>This illness is a test of my faith. If it’s His will to take me, it doesn’t matter where I am. I can accept that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does anybody believe anything you say? You’re not accepting. You’re running away. Just like you always do. You ran away from the monastery, you get laid, you ran away from the real world when getting laid didn’t work out so good. Now things aren’t working out again, so off you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Why is it so difficult for you to believe in God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn’t based on logic and experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I experience God on a daily basis, and the miracle of life all around. The miracle of birth, the miracle of love. He is always with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby? Hmmm? And watching her mother abandon her because she needs another score. The miracle of love. You’re twice as likely to be killed by the person you love than by a stranger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don’t be an idiot. ‘Cause you can tell me you put your faith in God to put you through the day, but when it comes time to cross the road, I know you look both ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I don’t believe He is inside me and is going to save me. I believe He is inside me whether I live or die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then you might as well live. You’ve got a better shot betting on me than on Him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>When I was 15, I was on every kind of birth control known to man, and I still got pregnant. I blamed God. I hated Him for ruining my life, but then I realized something. You can’t be angry with God and not believe in him at the same time. No one can. Not even you, Dr. House.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She has God inside her. It would have been easier to deal with a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe she’s allergic to God.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We looked everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place: inside her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>On her medical history she didn’t mention any surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She didn’t have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if she refuses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tell her I’m looking for a miracle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No piercings, no fillings, no surgical pins in the arm, no implants…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It’s clean as a whistle. What’s House looking for? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Lock on it. Get a 3D representation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The copper cross, a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So, she’s allergic to copper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rare, but it happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Wouldn’t she know she had an IUD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She had an abortion. IUD must have been left in, embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn’t be detected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So, all we have to do is remove the IUD –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>-- and the symptoms should subside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>I got this IUD when I was fifteen. It’s been more than twenty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Prolonged exposure to an allergen with minimal symptoms. But at some point, all it takes is one last contact to cause a full-blown reaction. It’s like a balloon filled with air. One last breath, it explodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>The first time I got the rash was when I was washing the copper cookware.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And all your subsequent symptoms came from ingesting food prepared in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>Dr. House found his miracle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I doubt he’ll interpret it that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>You told me your favorite passage. Would you like to hear mine? . “Celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The prodigal son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Augustine</speaker><content>He’ll be waiting for you when you’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We’ll schedule your surgery for tomorrow.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose and all the tissues are soggy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I think that’s the seventh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, seventh is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>God, we must be fun at parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I think we both know the flaw in that theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How’s the Sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kidneys functioning, heart rate is normal. You know how it is with nuns: you take out their IUDs and they bounce right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Told you I didn’t screw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave her 0.1 cc of epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn’t taken you off the case, you would have killed her.  You want to come over for Christmas dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re Jewish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, Hanukkah dinner. What do you care? It’s food, it’s people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe I’ll come to your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your wife doesn’t mind being alone at Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m a doctor, she’s used to being alone.  I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Neither do I. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You did good with the nun. Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Merry Christmas, Dr. House. Dr. Wilson. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Good night. That was sweet.</content></utterance>
