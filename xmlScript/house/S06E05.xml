</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BUSINESS MAN</speaker><content>$52 million includes over $6 million already issued pursuant to the over-allotment option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>When can we close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>OLIVER</speaker><content>It would be subject to regulatory approval in both Toronto and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content> I didn't say, "how," Oliver. I said, "when."  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>You sure this is a direction you want to go, Roy? This would move us from energy service into energy...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>You don't think oil's going up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>Well of course it's going to go up. The question is when.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>The question is always when, and if we wait until the deal makes sense to everyone else, we're going to be waiting in line behind everyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>All I'm saying is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>The same cover-your-ass crap you always say.  We're going to have to wrap this up. I've got to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Upstairs.  Get the regulators on it. I want to close by the end of the month. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>Come on, Roy. There are ten other items on the agenda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Which will have to wait until next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>KEN</speaker><content>You can't drag us all out of the office, get halfway through, and then just kick us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Yeah, I can. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>The antibiotic treatment had no effect. Both the fever and the pain are getting worse, which means it's not clostridium difficile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>But you said that was the only diagnosis that made sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>DOCTOR</speaker><content>It was. We need to get him to a hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> Dad?  I don't want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>I know, buddy. But we may need to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>Am I going to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Well, I just do.  And I'm always right, aren't I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>I want House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>I understand, but I told you Dr. House isn't available. Dr...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Call him. Tell him I'll have a private jet pick him up from whatever island...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>He isn't on vacation. Dr. Foreman's one of our best doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Is House in jail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No. Foreman is currently working with two of House's most veteran associates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>No. Mr. Randall, your son will be in good hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>My son... has already been in good hands, and he's still dying. I'm through dealing with good. I want the best, and everyone I've asked says that's House. So unless he's dead, comatose, or insane, I want him treating my son, today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You could have said no, in good conscience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>The kid'll still be Foreman's patient, but his dad wants you making the decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Then he's not my patient. You want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Which means I get...  Oh, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Don't let him do anything crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>When is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Maybe never. This game is fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>You also need to prepare President Dibala's case for this week's morbidity and mortality conference. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh... Unfortunately I'm overdue a mani-pedi appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Not you. Foreman's department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We made the wrong call, he died. There's nothing to present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It obviously garnered a lot of curiosity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>And we don't have more important things to do than satisfy everyone's idle curiosity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>It's not idle. The question of how we deal with two possible diagnoses whose treatments are contraindicated is worth discussing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Abdominal pain increasing in severity and frequency, fever, dehydration, diarrhea, weight loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes, which has been ruled out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>17 doctors. Everything's been ruled out. Which means we have to re-rule out. Get a new history and physical.  Unless that's crazy, boss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>You been out of the country or on any recent camping trips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>No camping. But we were in Montreal back in January.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>We went to see the NHL all-star game for my birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Where's Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>In his office. He's really more of a decider than a do-er. He's decided we should start over. Never know what previous doctors may have missed.  Like this.  Does that hurt more when I push there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I'm not sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Just keep it clean, simple. We did a test that called into question our initial diagnosis, so we changed our mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>And if they ask how the test was done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Why would they do that? It's a routine lab test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Routine lab tests don't involve blood you stole from a corpse to trick me into giving the guy the wrong treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yes, and if you brought that up, it'd certainly make for a lively debate about the morality of murdering murderers. But since you burned the only evidence of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>To cover for you, not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>You're protected. The decision was a coin flip. There was no right or wrong answer. The body's underground, 8,000 miles away. Nobody can prove anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>That room will be filled, not because of a coin flip, not because of the patient, but because House's department screwed up. They're going to be like sharks in a chum-filled swimming pool, and there's no way I'm jumping in unless I'm in a steel cage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>So what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I want to know you have everything covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Got what covered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>We're just reviewing the Dibala case. Making sure we didn't miss anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>We didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>He's constipated. Physical revealed a mass in his abdomen, so I repeated the X-ray.  Old one was clean. New one shows that his colon's almost completely impacted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Obstruction would explain the pain. You think they just screwed up the old X-ray? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Hirschsprung's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's a congenital disorder of the nerves in the colon. Very rare in a child your son's age. Most doctors would never think of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>And you came up with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>It's House's idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>We need a barium enema and biopsy to confirm. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>Let me guess. It tastes really bad, but it's going to make me feel a lot better. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Actually, you're not going to taste it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> You should try searching for "Misty May digs for gold."  Make sure you put it in quotes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I'm making travel plans. Just need to get away. Have some time to myself.  You getting the hint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So that's it?  You're done with your little experiment with Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>It wasn't an experiment. It was a relationship. You may want to look into the difference.  I'm glad you're better, House. I actually liked working for you. But I'm not coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good. 'Cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Are you here to try to save my relationship with Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>God no. Trying to save MY relationship with Foreman. Right now I'm Kobe, playing the game I love, however the hell I want. Phil Jackson has to listen to everyone else bitch about it.  Enjoy Cabo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I'm going to Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Really? Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Good-bye, House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good-bye Thirteen. </content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Last week, yesterday, today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>I can't believe it. He's pain-free for the first time in months. He's even hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>JACK</speaker><content>I'm starving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>We're still waiting for the biopsy results, but obviously it's a good sign. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You're going to want to take it slow. Don't try to regain all the lost weight in one meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>The abdomen feels normal, but it looks bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Jack, are you feeling... Jack?  Hey, Jack, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Right eye's fixed. Lateral rectus palsy.  He's seizing.  Need five milligrams of diazepam. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>What, what's happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Hold down his head and turn off the lights. I need to see his optic disk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Heart rate is elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Come on, hold his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>NURSE</speaker><content>I'm trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Wait! Where, where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> OK, Mr. Randall, we need you to step back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>His optic disk is swollen. He's got intracranial hypertension. Furosemide. 20 milligrams IV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>If we could intubate him, we could hyperventilate him...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Need five more milligrams of diazepam. DC the monitors. Push 500 milligrams phenytoin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content> We can't push that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We got to relieve the pressure or his brain could herniate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>50 milligrams of phenytoin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Page Chase. Tell him to meet us in the OR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> We need your consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>What's happening to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Pressure in his skull's too high. If we don't reduce it, it could irrevocably damage his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>But he was just talking. He was smiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>We need to drill burr holes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Drill into his head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Phenytoin's not working. Paralyze him. Three milligrams pancuronium. Then intubate and hyperventilate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Where's House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>House isn't here. Do we have your consent? Do we have your consent?  Ready? One, two, three. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Injecting three milligrams of pancuronium. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Look at the monitors. He's still seizing. We need to do this now.  Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Electrical seizure activity's stopped. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Intracranial pressure's declining.  Come on. Keep going. Pressure's down to eight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I'll go tell the dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He hasn't had any more seizures, and cytological examination of the subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He was fine after the procedure. No headaches. No mental status change. It wasn't anything we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>It's not just his brain. He's continuing to build up fluid in his abdominal cavity as well as the Dura. We've inserted shunts to drain it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Got to be some sort of systemic infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not after spending the last week getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Notice anything odd about the shape of the fluid collection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, God, it's... The Virgin Mary. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The edge should be tapered, lens shaped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Unless... The Dural layer was already separated from the brain when the fluid started to build up. Get a Dural biopsy to confirm brain cancer.  Nice catch.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker><content>Wow. Bangkok, that sounds awesome. How long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Not sure yet. Luckily I have a friend who's staying at my place, taking care of my dog. He's really big, so he needs a lot of exercise.  Remy Hadley. H-a-d-l-e-y.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Okay, you're a saint.  That's impossible. I confirmed my reservation last night. So rebook it. Well, obviously it was a mistake on your end, not mine. No, I'm on my way to the airport right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ROY</speaker><content>Our luck just keeps getting worse, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Treatment options are getting better every day. There's no visible mass, so even if the biopsy comes back positive, we've caught it early.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>I'm saying we will do whatever we can.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I know you canceled my reservation. You obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was talking to you. I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Which is why I don't want you back on the team. Now that you're out of the picture, he's better than ever, which is going to make me less miserable than ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you went to get from it all.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The printout they sent you included just the anticentromere antibodies, but the lab also did a full blood panel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>So, I'm not an idiot. I obviously made sure the cadaver I got the sample from had the same blood type.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies that could cause seizures.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Yeah...  It's no big deal. Cholesterol didn't have anything to do with his death, but, you know, after being let go from Mercy and then that thing with Thirteen's drug trial, Foreman's paranoid about people questioning the way he handled the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Well that's ridiculous. If anything, Foreman should be feeling secure. He's the one who had the right diagnosis. We're the ones who talked him out of it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>That's just the way I am, but still don't know what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Cuddy had IT trace all the IP addresses who've logged in to my email account. There were two. Mine and yours. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Obviously House decided he needs you more than he's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I already asked House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>And he'd certainly never lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>No, he'd lie. Except he wants me gone. And he'd do a lot better job of lying than you just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Really? It was that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>No, actually. But it doesn't matter anymore. Why? Because of House or Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You're good for both of them, but Foreman's not my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>House will be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Maybe. But with you on the team, he'd be better. He needs someone... Who doesn't need him. You're the only one he's never really been able to suck into his crazy House vortex. Keeps him grounded. His ego in check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Why didn't you just come to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I figured you'd only stay if House asked... And I knew he would, eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> Bye Wilson. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>This is a great job. Maybe even better now that House is at least trying to have real relationships with people.  I said "trying."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> It doesn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>The job you love doesn't matter? Don't throw it all away just because of a bad break-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Bye Wilson. </content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I just confessed.  I told Thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You mean why did I confess or why did I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You want her to stay because you want her back or because Foreman does? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Why would I care what Foreman wants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Because you're not as big a jerk as everyone thinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>No you're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I just made a $10,000 short sale on a stock I know is going to crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>No you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>You are a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She's making a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So you did it for her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She's a good doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So you did it for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'm not the one in charge anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So you did it for Foreman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why don't you just admit that you like having her around? She's good for you. You need her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>No you weren't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yes I... </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good. Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>For Degos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The cardiac arrest wasn't just a "everything goes to hell in a hand basket" arrest. It was a coronary event. Coronaries are large vessels. Means it can't be Degos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>But the biopsies confirmed...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Obstructed blood vessels. But they can't be obstructed because of Degos. Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nope. But I will be if he responds to the heparin and the immunoglobulin.  By the way, someone screwed over your girlfriend and she ran to me, Cuddy, and Wilson. Everyone but you. She's not over you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Or she is. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>Find what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>The niacin bound chromium supplements.  It was right on top of the file. You don't know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No. Been here all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>One of Dibala's previous docs was prescribing ultra high doses of niacin bound chromium to boost his HDL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>So it gives us something to point to. We can explain the wide variation between the HDL numbers. We're safe. We're covered. You really didn't request the info?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>No. And obviously you didn't either. Which means...</content></utterance>
