<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Robin</speaker><content>3, 6, and 9 are in your folders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Can I have some more –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Robin</speaker><content>Tea’s at your seat. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Robin</speaker><content> Hello? Oh, hold on.  Ben Federman again. Another pre-call. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>We did the pre-call. This is the post-pre-call-call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Board’s gonna want some specifics for the push into the Asian market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Ben, there are no specifics about Asia. We came up with that as a Hail Mary at three in the morning to placate the board about International!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Carly, I’m just giving you a heads-up about Asia. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>There is no Asia.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Let’s talk about Asia. We’re in the preliminary stages of forming a strategic alliance with Credit Lyonnais. Within three months you won’t be able to walk four feet in Kyung Hong, South Korea, without seeing one of our beautiful models smiling at you from billboards and drugstore windows inviting you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Boardmember</speaker><content>That’s incredible news, Carly. We’d hoped to hear something about Asia, but had no idea plans were so far along. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Well, you know Asia. Nothing’s done until it’s done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Boardmember</speaker><content>Carly, I was wondering, could you walk us through what you were thinking for other Asian territories?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Absolutely. India has over half a billion women. In terms of spending power it’s the single largest potential market in the world.  Um, we have retained a local firm to ensure that cultural differences are respected, um, however, I can’t go into the specifics of my plan with you until tomorrow; right now I have a meeting and I need the room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Boardmember 2</speaker><content>We were just getting started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content> I know, and I do apologize. It’s last minute, but the meeting is with three State Department officials to smooth the way for China. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Boardmember</speaker><content>China? This is just incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>We’ll be in touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Boardmember</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Robin</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I need a doctor. I can’t move my leg!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>32-year-old female, paralysis and severe pain in her right quad. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How’d she get to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics. Three assistants and fifteen VPs checked out who should be treating her. Who da man? I da man. I always suspected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House, I know the chances are very slim, but I’m sure you recognize that she may have what you had: a clot in her thigh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> A bit of a long shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What about a disc herniation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I don’t know, Eric. If her disc were herniated, she’d present with pain elsewhere, wouldn’t she? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, I suppose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You’re right, a clot’s also the most deadly, right, Robert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>True. The clot breaks off, she could stroke and die. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House, I believe that they’re right, and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You read one of those negotiating books, didn’t you? “Getting to Yes: Fifty Ways to Win an Argument.” “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Being a Pal.” In five seconds you just manipulated these two into agreeing with your point of view.  Fellas, this is known as “soft positional bargaining.” It’s not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. House, are you saying that she doesn’t have a clot or are you saying that if she does have a clot she doesn’t need blood thinners and an angiogram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase, put her on blood thinners, do an angiogram.  When that comes back negative, MRI the spine. If that’s clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Excellent suggestion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Read less, more TV.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s rare for an individual to make a donation significant enough to impact an organization as large and unwieldy as a hospital. This donation does come with one string: that he be made Chairman of the Board. I think that’s a reasonable request.  I think he should have the right to know what it is we do with his $100 million. Please welcome our new Chairman of the Board, Edward Vogler. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Thank you, thank you. When I was eighteen, my dad loaned me $20, 000 for a college tuition which he would have known was a mistake had he known that I wasn’t actually in college.  I took his money and invested in a friend who had a little business, and when my dad found out what I had done with his money, he and I didn’t talk much after that. But my friend’s business took off, and I used the profits from that to buy another company, and another, and I must have been pretty good at it, had a good eye, because before I knew it people were making offers for my company. And, uh, about a year ago I went public and overnight I was worth a billion dollars. So I went to see my dad.  I’ll admit, I wanted a little payback, you know, kind of shove the wind in his face, so I went upstate and sat in the kitchen I grew up in and, uh, he had no reaction. It wasn’t his fault, he didn’t even know who I was. Because his Alzheimer’s had taken a turn for the worse, despite the best drugs and care out there, and that is why I’m here. What if my contribution to this hospital is the difference between no cure and a cure for cancer? The difference between a man not recognizing his wife of 35 years and being able to look at her and say, “Good morning, honey. I love you.”  If there’s a disease out there killing people, I am writing you a blank check to fight back.  So, things are going to change, a lot. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Do what you need to do, I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pretty sure my x-ray machine can take your phone in a fight. It’ll fry it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content> Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Jenny </speaker><content>How old is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>32.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Jenny</speaker><content>Wow. She’s already the CEO of a public company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s a workaholic. Okay Carly, hold still. The x-ray machine is gonna pass over your leg.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What, you want to put more vending machines in the hallway? Maybe a roulette wheel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Nice one. But I’m serious. The product that you’re selling is good health, it shouldn’t be a tough sell. You don’t want to sell, it means people don’t care about your product. You care if people are healthy, or are you too proud for that?  Who’s that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s, uh, just one of our doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Aren’t doctors supposed to wear lab coats. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He’s… different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Everyone’s buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, not exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Then why does he get away with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It’s just a coat. He’s very good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rick</speaker><content>Ah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Perfect. Okay, that’s it. We should know in a couple of days what’s growing in your son’s throat.  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ricky</speaker><content>He can’t talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ricky</speaker><content>He had knee surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ricky</speaker><content>About a year ago, and then he couldn’t talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, yeah, well, that happens. You know, it’s very dangerous operating so close to the vocal chords. Okay, well, we’ll send your kid’s culture to the lab and somebody will call you.  BOO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ricky</speaker><content>AAH! </content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need you to wear your lab coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. Like half your age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wear the coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Man oh man. Someone got spanked real good this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Guy gives $100 million to cure cancer, pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cure cancer. Is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating patients?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You know that’s not what he’s doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know exactly what he’s doing. He’s using us to run clinical trials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, shame on him! Saving lives like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s unethical.  Oh, are you coming in, too? I thought I had you convinced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Clinical trials save thousands of lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s using patients as guinea pigs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Pharmaceutical companies do that every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are we a pharmaceutical company? We’re gonna wind up pressuring desperate patients into choices that are bad for them, good for us. You’re gonna compromise patient care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who the hell am I talking to? Suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s interesting is it suddenly doesn’t bother you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So, if you ignore ethics to save one person it’s admirable, but if you do it to save a thousand you’re a bastard. All he’s done is taken your game and gone pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He’s not going to kill a few patients. He’s going to kill this hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It took him three seconds to size you up, and surprise? He doesn’t like you. Wear the damn coat.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hello. I’m Dr. Foreman, I work with Dr. House. Our initial tests say you’re fine. We think you may have had a clot but it resolved on its own, so we’re gonna keep you overnight to be safe and you can go back home tomorrow. Or, back to work. Hey, you okay.   Get in here! I need a line in her, IV morphine, stat!</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Get any read on the new Chairman of the Board?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, he took your parking space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not necessarily bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Do you ever watch “Gilligan’s Island” reruns and really, really think they’re gonna get off the island this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We should introduce ourselves. It couldn’t hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Make him a bundt cake. Patient hit a ten on the pain scale. What would explain that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There was no clot in her leg, the angio was totally clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What about the muscle biopsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No neurogenic or myopathic abnormalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s also negative for trichinosis, no toxoplasmosis or polyarteritis nodosa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Robert, what was her sedimentation rate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Normal, Allison, therefore no inflammation, no immunologic response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you mind sharing that number with me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fifteen, Allison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you mocking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Duh, Allison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m just suggesting we look outside the box. What if her sed rate is elevated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, let’s go further outside the box. Let’s say the angio revealed a clot, and let’s say we treated that clot, and now she’s all better, and personally thanked me by performing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>My Aunt Elisa lives in Philiadelphia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, it’s storytime! Let me get my baba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Her normal temperature is 96.2, not 98.6 like you and me. If her temperature were 98.6, she’d have a fever. I’m just wondering if you think we could apply the same logic to Carly’s sed rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s absurd. I love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If 15 is high for Carly, then she has inflammation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I’ll talk to Wilson. Next time, skip Aunt Elisa.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re probably talking about a primary bone cancer. Can be tricky to detect, you’ll need a bone scan –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s why I’m talking to an oncologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sure, I’ve nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports… new Chairman of the Board, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh! I hadn’t heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right. Clinical trials…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Completely unethical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And a very bad omen for you. There’s not much money in curing African sleeping sickness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I have seen every scary movie ever made. Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator of blood, boys’ choirs: those are bad omens. This is much more mundane: a billionaire wants to get laid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid. They buy hospitals to get respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And the reason you want respect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>To… get laid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay then. You’ve just gotta think like a billionaire.  Let’s see, big scary changes, and then, “Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to discuss your future on my G-5 private jet.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, come on. You know how good you have it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I’m the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You do the cases you want to do, when you want to do them. You’re not going to get that anywhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Relax, I’ve been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time, same story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Just keep your head down, that’s all I’m saying. And put on your coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It itches.  So, are you going to do this bone scan for me or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You remember a guy named Van Der Meer? Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>Well, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn’t get hypertensive during surgery? No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>What, you’re going to get involved now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>I didn’t touch the son. I’m not taking any responsibility there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The son’s fine. Can’t shut him up. The dad show any signs of cortical disease? Wernicke’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Simpson</speaker><content>No. Nothing. And that’s why we settled; because we couldn’t find anything. The guy got over a million dollars, don’t tell me he’s complaining.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Robin</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content> Thank you.  There are two Dr. Wilsons in the hospital. One in ophthalmology and one in cancer.  My eyes are fine, so you’re here to tell me I have cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There’s no cancer in your bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>You’re not smiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There’s something called referred pain. You could have cancer in one part of your body that presents in another. Given your age and your family history, I’m thinking your colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content> Great.  I was at Columbia when my mom died. Now there’s a blast. Cleaning up her vomit and running to my econ final. Look, if I’m a short-timer give me drugs, I’ll go back to work, I’ll die there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Whoa. There’s a quick test to see if you even have it, a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I know how you do that test. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you have colon cancer, we can treat it, it’s early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>That’s what they told my mom. She was dead six months later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You’re a smart person about to make a very bad decision. You know, cancer treatment’s come a long way in twelve years, but if you don’t do this now –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I don’t want to be looked at! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There is another way. We could do a virtual colonoscopy. Basically, we do a CT scan of your colon. It’s non-invasive, but it’s very expensive. I assume that’s not a problem.  Say yes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She was uncomfortable doing any more tests! I had to convince her to do that one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s not an inflammatory process, it’s not a clot because Chase’s angio says so, and it’s not cancer because her toosh is perfect. Anybody else got an Aunt Elisa with weird stuff? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There’s no indication of any abnormalities. No lesions, no spurs, no masses –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her toes are screwed up. They’re backwards. Do you guys know how much surgery it’s going to take to swap them back?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ll redo her angio straight away –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’ll do nothing! Foreman, you do the angiogram. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There was a shadow on the first test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>A shadow? A shadow means there could be a blood clot, right? I read Conn’s Current Therapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Real page turner. No, it’s not that kind of shadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>My chest hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s from the tracer I injected. Might also get a little nauseous, or have a metallic taste, all normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I’m a runner. I shouldn’t feel like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Carly, I’m looking at your vitals right now, and –</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay, see, now you’re just being stubborn. It’s cold, perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Thoracentesis revealed a transudate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Haven’t gotten it back yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fracture? Maybe you could treat it, surgically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Haven’t done the MUGA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you know she needs a heart transplant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t tell you anything. Professional responsibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Like that matters to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not my professional responsibility, yours. New regime, you gotta keep your head down, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Now, that’s good thinking, because I was going to go right to Cuddy and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not saying you want to, I’m saying you’d be obligated to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because of my position on the Board?  Because of my position on the transplant committee?  Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You sure you’re doing the right thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve come up with a few really great rationalizations. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry to interrupt. We have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Thoracentesis revealed a transudate.  We did an echo. She’s in severe congestive heart failure. She needs a heart transplant. We’ll get her on the list immediately –</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Thanks. What is a “Department of Diagnostic Medicine”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s Dr. House’s department. They deal with cases that other doctors can’t figure out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>It’s a financial black hole.  Department costs us $3 million a year, treat one patient a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He saves one patient per week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>What about everyone else? His department’s not going to find the cure for breast cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, maybe not, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Are you sleeping with House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>But you did, right? A long time ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That’s an incredibly inappropriate question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>If your judgment is compromised by prior or current relationship, that is my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I respect him, that is all you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>He’s still not wearing a coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I told him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>I’m sure you did. And yet, he’s not wearing it. I’m just wondering if that’s a reflection on him, or on you. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I run, I work out, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You cut yourself. Probably highly ritualized. You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin song over and over while you do it, probably works better than anti-depressants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>I don’t understand how that has to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re a high-powered bulimic. You make yourself throw up. You have to find the most efficient way to vomit without revealing the tell-tale signs of bulimia, which is all, eugh. Very unseemly, for a CEO. So, you found a common antidote for accidental poisoning to do the job: ipecac. Which is great, if your kid’s just swallowed a bottle of aspirin, but really, really bad if it’s a habit. It causes muscle damage. It caused the pain in your leg. And it destroyed your heart. How often do you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Three times a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In about an hour, there’s going to be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available. Problem is, I am required to tell the committee of your bulimia, it’s a major psychiatric condition. Ranks right up there with suicidal, makes you a very bad risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>So you’re here to tell me I have just a few hours to live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless I lie to the committee. But if they find out, I lose my medical license. This would be a very good time to offer me a bribe. How much is your life worth, how much is my job worth –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Why are you here doing this to me? What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to know what’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Am I worth it? You think I’m pathetic. Has a good job, everything in the world, but she just doesn’t like the way that she looks –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, stop hiding!  I’m asking you if you want to live or die, you can’t even say that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>What do you want me to do? Cry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes! I want you to tell me that your life is important to you, because I don’t know!  Because that’s what’s on the table right now: your life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content> I don’t want to die. I don’t.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh. Patient rapidly deteriorated and now has severe congestive heart failure. Pressers and vasodilators have not improved her conditions whatsoever. Pulmonary function tests show an FVC of over 3 liters with EDD-1 of at least 90% of predicted. And preserved FEB/FEC ratio and preserved DLCO as well.  Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19% with no focal wall or motion abnormalities. Heart catheterization revealed clean left, right and circumflex arteries, and subsequent biopsy revealed irreversible cardiomyopathy.  Which is why we’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, Dr. House, I’m confused by your time and date stamps. It appears that you put Carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had a hunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don’t have hunches. You know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the lists, but on the long shot…  On the long shot I was right, I didn’t want to waste time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>CAT scan revealed no tumors and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No atherosclerotic vascular disease –</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No alcohol, no drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Any psychiatric conditions, history of depression –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s a little blue, but turns out she needs a heart transplant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr. House, if you subvert or mislead this committee, you will be subject to disciplinary action. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason to think that I would lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I simply want you to answer the question! Is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria that would disqualify your patient from getting a heart?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Wait, you’re getting mad at me for sticking up for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, I like it here.  You guys don’t think it’s weird House knew the patient needed a heart transplant before we did any heart tests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That’s House. He knows things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>But usually, he’s putting it in our face, telling us how cleverly he figured it out. This time, nothing. Just “I had a hunch.”</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, sing for me.  Oh, no, no, no, no… come on, look. When you had your surgery, you were intubated. Surgeon stuck a tube down your throat. Now, it never happens, and it’s never caught, but it happens. Your vocal chords were paralyzed. I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox. Ironically, a substance that tightens every other corner of your face actually loosens the tongue. I have healed you. You can talk.  Oh, well.  BOOOO!  Okay, you don’t have to say anything, it can be our little secret. If you can talk, blink twice.  But you’re not going to, because you think you won’t be entitled to the money you won in the settlement with Simpson. Yesterday I would have said you’d have to give the money back. Today… hospital’s come into a lot of money, mum’s the word. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines, schedule of medications, and a strict diet: just what someone with an eating disorder needs. So, I thought I’d get you started.  Fried chicken from the Carnegie Deli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Carly</speaker><content>Why did you fight for me? You risked so much, and you hardly know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re my patient. Don’t screw it up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Love this part!  Okay. He ruined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself. I’m Edward Vogler, new Chairman of the Board. In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am sorry about the lab coat thing. The dry cleaners destroyed it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>That was my very first heart transplant meeting, very exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Trust me. Six Flags, way more exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Patient’s very lucky to have such a passionate doctor who stands up for what he believes in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sweet of you to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Yeah. ‘Fraid you’ve been duped, though.  The nurse found this in the patient’s purse. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, my. If only I’d known.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Tough being a doctor. You’ve got all that power. The power to play God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I don’t envy the transplant committee their responsibility. They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl. I’m not sure I could have done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>This is not a game to me, Dr. House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. This is actually more like we’re dancing right now, so let’s get to the point. You don’t like me. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to like you. It’s nothing personal, I don’t like anybody. But none of that really matters, does it, because you’ve got money, and I’ve got tenure. You need full board approval to get rid of me. I’ve got Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And Wilson. So, as long as we’re stuck with each other, we might as well ignore each other.  That wasn’t nearly as dramatic as I was hoping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>Vogler</speaker><content> I looked into that tenure thing, and you’re right. It’s actually easier for me to get rid of a board member like Cuddy or Wilson than to get rid of a doctor. That’s interesting, isn’t it? </content></utterance>
