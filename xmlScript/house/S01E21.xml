<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it? I think I’m coming down with a little bit of the clap. I may have to go home for a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Dr. Riley doesn’t have a history of lying to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said this is the fifth time he’s missed a class this year! Either he’s dying or he’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’ll give you two hours off clinic duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. [He starts to walk off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why is it always me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Because the world hates you. Or because it’s a class on diagnostics. Pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not doing it.  You’re supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Two. I know you’d rather spend a couple of hours listening to yourself than listening to patients. Class starts in twenty minutes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Dr. House, there’s a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m outta here, take it up with Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>A voice</speaker><content>Gregg. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi, Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like… you ever see those “Girls Gone Wild” videos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Your life’s been like that, or your life’s been spent watching them?  I have missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that why you’re here? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I need your help. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who am I looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>My husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells. No sign of tumors, no vasculitis. Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone. A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Did you think I wasn’t going to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy’s pancreas is pathetic. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, maybe there’s nothing to be found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The walks are out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I was around you long enough to know when something’s not right. Mark’s had personality changes, he’s acting strange, disconnected…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting. It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No affair, no nothing! He’s sick! I know you’re not too busy; you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I’m asking you a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not too busy, but I’m not sure I want him to live. It’s good seeing you again. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What’s wrong with them?  I’m not going to like you, am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Statistically, you’re right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That’s six legs. So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>What were they doing when pain presented?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I have no idea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>You didn’t ask? You didn’t take a history?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The Baywatch thespian. And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer.  Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which?  Okay, I say we start with the farmer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you hike to the fence, and how far?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Farmer</speaker><content>Yes, it’s about half a mile from my farmhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And where’s the pain localized?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Farmer</speaker><content>It started just above my ankle and it’s radiating up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, what should we do first? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Family history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Indicative of leg pain? That’s a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Could be a blood issue. We should run a CBC and a D-dimer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>And get an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>MRI or a PET scan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>If the problem’s vascular, he’s better off –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You had time to look at the leg. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>I thought we were starting with the farmer’s case first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We are. But if we’re going to look at a leg…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need you to take off your pants.  Puncture.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Snakebite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be my guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>Farmer didn’t know he had been bit by a snake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>What kind of snake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don’t know what kind of snake it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, there are people to find those things out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Shouldn’t we wait for the Humane Society or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The guy might only have a couple of hours. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You have tendonitis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>How old is this person? I mean, it’s not really a 40-year-old man on a girls’ volleyball team, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Well, I was just worried that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you worry about her more if she was younger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Obviously we should care about our patients no matter what age –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She’s mine, stay away.  Would you operate on your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Of course not. I’d be too nervous; couldn’t be objective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family? The actual patient is 16. Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I need to know everything about you. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson’s, or any other degenerative condition. But there’s this boy at school, and he’s on the boys’ volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won’t call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn’t like her and never did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got all this from an examination of the knee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think she’s depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She doesn’t have tendoni—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She has tendonitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s depressed about having tendonitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, the boy’s a jerk, she knows that, and yet she’s depressed. I found a nodule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah. Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> I’ll run the tests.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Carmen</speaker><content>Can I put my pants back on now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’d rather you didn’t. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Which Carmen Electra is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>First one. The golfer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Then why isn’t she wearing pants? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>Slipped disc?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Could be. How bad does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Carmen</speaker><content> It hurts really, really bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>It doesn’t seem real. Is she the one faking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, for God’s sake. She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep.  Fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Late 30s Man</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with me?  Do something! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Or it could be referred pain from his groin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>He’s curling; it’s not the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sir, where are you getting pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Late 30s Man</speaker><content>Help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>He’s not going to tell us anything if we don’t get him out of pain. Give him 50mg of Demerol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>We have no history, he could be allergic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>We can’t diagnose him while he screams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>Better than killing him with pain killers, then – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Apparently, he’s not allergic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>Late 30s Man</speaker><content>Thank you, I feel a lot better now. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>We screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you did exactly what his attending did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>And that was the proper way to handle the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>The guy used him as a dealer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Yeah, timber rattlesnake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Four vials of the CroFab antivenin. Hey, how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Farmer</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast.  He’s having an allergic reaction, bag.  Paddles and epi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>But his heart’s fine—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not going to stay that way.  Paddles!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn’t think she was going to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She asked me the same question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And… what? You’re not gonna treat him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s probably nothing wrong with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, sure, that makes sense. She’s just using the old “sick husband” routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she’d be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I should help her because she hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She doesn’t hate you. She loves you, she just can’t stand to be around you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Uh, Dr. House? It’s been almost six minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Found him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don’t really care about the volleyball player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I didn’t. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We’re going to start you on Thyroxin. It’ll make you feel better and level your moods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Volleyball Player</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>So, that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were right the first time. Snakebite guy’s way more interesting. Gross, actually.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested. Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it’s a timber rattlesnake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, it’s not. Notice the volume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>We’re supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>So we give him the antivenin for the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is that a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>Well, we can’t just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>We’ve gotta find the right snake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>But you said –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin?  And who goes looking for the snake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>Keen</speaker><content>But we can’t be blamed for –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay. It’s much simpler than that. It’s just plain wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> We gave the guy the antivenin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Farmer</speaker><content>What if I’m allergic again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s why these people are here. If you have a reaction, we’re ready to do whatever’s necessary to ensure your airway stays open and your heart keeps beating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Farmer</speaker><content>My wife’s on her way in, can’t this wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m sorry, it can’t. [He begins to inject the serum, and nothing happens. House nods, and leaves the room to be confronted by the Late 30s Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Late 30s Man</speaker><content>It hurts again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>He came back?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It’s not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You’d be getting better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s just taking longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No, it’s not. We’ve got to let him cut the leg off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s my leg. It’s my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Would you give up your leg to save my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I would say it’s their choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Wha – not a chance! You’d browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You’d shove it in their face that it’s just a damn leg! You don’t think you deserve to live? You don’t think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>The pain alone is going to kill you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="49-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No. He’s asked to be put in a chemically induced coma so he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What happens after he’s in the coma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We’ll obviously monitor his condition closely, and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I meant, I’m his health-care proxy, I get to make medical decisions for him if he’s not able to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You should talk to him about what he wants to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I know what he wants, but if he’s out it’s my call, right? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="50-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>The middle ground you were talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We go in, take out the dead muscle. There’s still some risk of reperfusion injury, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Give me the forms you need signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re saving his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="50-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He won’t see it that way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="51"><utterance uid="51-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="51-7"><speaker>Caring</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. It’s the patient’s call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-8"><speaker>Rebellious</speaker><content>The patient’s an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Twenty minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="51-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m not doing this again.  And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad. Not even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That’s why he’s always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. </content></utterance>
