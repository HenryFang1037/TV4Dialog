<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Muahahahaaaaahhh  Gotcha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you actually wake up early and hide under the bed just to scare the crap outta me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Set an alarm and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's like dating a ten-year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>God, I hope not.  Now that we're down here…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hold that thought. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I have to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'll wait. I brought a book.  I didn't know what time your alarm was set for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know, you can rent this space out down here. In Japan, that would be like a deluxe—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, shut up.  There's blood in my urine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You really don't have to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're my girlfriend. I'm being supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm mainly talking about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, given that there's almost certainly nothing wrong with you, and my patient definitely has something wrong with him—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That can't wait an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Fraid not. He's…  Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>16-year-old male spit up blood during a pick-up basketball game. E.R. couldn't find the source in his lungs or GI tract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>See? Serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Could be vasculitis, bronchiectasis, inhaled particles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What about angiodysplasia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Urologist</speaker><content>Ready when you are…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Get them outta here. My urethra is not for public entertainment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But it is a good-time adjacent.  Feed the kid a camera. Check his gut for angiodysplasia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Urologist</speaker><content>All right. If you could scoot down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hey, I'm, uh, I'm missing a watch. So can you keep your eyes open while—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay! You too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This little camera transmits images to the data recorder so we can see if you've got any vascular malformations in your GI tract.  Your records show you've lost some weight over the past year. Was that intentional?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Todd</speaker><content>Well, he's been eating less since he quit the swim team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>You have to get up early for swim. It wasn't fun anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I need to talk to your son about sexual activity. Generally, it's less embarrassing for everyone—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Kay</speaker><content>We're leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>Actually, I've only—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How long have you been cutting yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>Those are from a layback grind that went wrong. Came off my skateboard straight into a fence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>So… no to cutting but yes to appetite and sleep changes, and you quit something you used to enjoy. How long have you been depressed?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Imaging showed no sign of upper GI issues. But the kid did admit to being depressed and to smoking pot to take the edge off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are very pleased with yourself, aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>His marijuana could be laced with formaldehyde or lead, which could cause a pulmonary hemorrhage which could make him spit up blood.  Yes. Yes, I am. I thought it was a good catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Run a lead level and push 5 liters IV fluid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Feel free to tip your other server.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cystoscopy was clean. Cytopathology was normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why do you have my lab results?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I don't. If I did, I'd know you were fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Unless the blood came from my kidneys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come on. Your hypochondriac mom had a brush with mortality last month, and it's understandable that you're worrying more than usual, worrying that you might turn into her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You're right. Odds are, this is nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Meet me in the cafeteria in ten. There'll be a corn dog with your name on it. I mean an actual corn dog. They fixed the deep fryer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I need to schedule an ultrasound.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>My dad's head's still in one piece, so I'm guessing you didn't mention the pot. What'd you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>The truth. You had a… minor chemical exposure, and we can't be 100% sure how it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>Thanks for covering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I know what it's like to be 16.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>You also know what it's like to be depressed. You figured out my deal after only a few minutes, but I been fooling my friends and parents for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's my job to notice things. Maybe talking to your parents would make things better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>I've tried. They take it personally that I'm not happy, and then I end up having to make them feel better. They don't get me. No one does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>In Med School, it seemed like everybody else could handle the pressure. I couldn't. I ended up hurting myself. Stupidest thing I've ever done.  You've got red spots in your eyes. They weren't there before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You have nice skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you. Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Sorry. Just thought it would be rude not to comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Just treat me like any other patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right.  Are you sucking in your stomach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.  Hurry up before I pass out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Ultrasound isn't definitive. We should run other tests before—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Stop talking like a doctor and tell me what you see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's a mass in your kidney.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We still don't know why Ryan coughed blood, and now he's got small hemorrhages in his eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sounds like an acquired coagulopathy, which gives us a pretty wide differential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Gets a lot narrower if we factor in his depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, don't do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Mood swings can be a symptom of physiological illness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not talking to you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Mood swings are also a symptom of adolescence along with emo music and masturbation. More importantly, his weight loss and sleeping issues started a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Infection makes the most sense. He shoots hoops at school, showers in the locker room. I'm thinking staph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You don't think—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not talking to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Everything okay with Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's fine. She's just too stupid to accept it. Start him on nafcillin for staph.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>All that's in the, uh, First Mutual safety deposit box. The retirement accounts—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're freaking out because of one ultrasound performed by an incompetent Bonobo monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly going about my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Calling a lawyer, drafting a will!  Okay. I-I… hacked into your online schedule. Look, tests always show something. A mass in your kidney could be a complex cyst. It could be benign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm a single mom. I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian. It's silly that I haven't done it before now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The biopsy's not till tomorrow. It's the first opening in the schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is… Oh, look! Now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My worry isn't any more important than anyone else's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But I'm not sick, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Good point. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Roid Rage</speaker><content>I want my stuff, asshat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>I told you, man, I don't have it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Hey… guys. Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Roid Rage</speaker><content>On my way out. I'll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You wanna… tell me what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>My friend gave me some leftover Klonopin he had when he switched his seizure meds. I sold them to Roid Rage for 80 bucks, but I landed in here before I could deliver, and now he's gonna rip my arms off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How often do you sell drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content>It was a one-time thing. I needed the cash, I had the pills, so I thought, "why not?" It was a bad idea. The pills are at my house. I could have a friend go get them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Give the thug his money back. One time only.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I mean, if you're okay with this. You have three kids of your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>It's not even a question. Of course I'll be Rachel's guardian. And House is cool with this? I mean, you guys…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We've only been together a few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Julia</speaker><content>Hmm. Seems like a lot longer. Probably because you've been talking about him for ten years. And by talking, I mean ranting about wanting to smash his teeth in with a stapler for being such a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>People change.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> That better be her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sitcom Studio Audience</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Rachel Cuddy, you were supposed to be home half an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don't blame me — he's the one who wouldn't run any red lights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content> Mouth on that kid makes Mel Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela. Where'd she learn that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know why you're here, but I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's the problem, officer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>She was shoplifting down at the mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sitcom Studio Audience</speaker><content>Aw!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Are either of you this girl's father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. But since her mom died, she's my favorite tax write-off. Officer, you have my word it won't happen again.  'Cause next time…  she won't get caught!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Good for you. You could have just assumed he was a drug dealer, but instead you took his word for it.  It's nice to finally see someone have a little faith in humanity around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why would you do that? Ryan, you okay in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Ryan</speaker><content> I'm not sure. I think I just peed blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Looks like peeing blood is the new black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Peeing blood after a night on antibiotics means we can move on from infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Scoping showed no sign of a bleed in his bladder, which points to a kidney problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably some kinda mass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood or the hemorrhages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You think it's cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mass doesn't have to be cancer. Could be renal hematoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>But the patient doesn't have any other abdominal trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He's… not talking about the patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's probably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's a mass, not a mystery. They'll do the biopsy, then you'll have your answer. Just… have to wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Patient admitted to using pot. Who knows what else he's doing. This could be a heroin-induced nephropathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>I thought you trusted this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And then you pointed out how sweet that was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the patient on plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>While he's doing that, can I at least search his house for drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have I ever said no to that question?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Pie-eating contest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You should be keeping her company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Okay. You've been worried that your relationship is getting in the way of your diagnoses, you're protecting your patient. Either that or… you're an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Three — I hate the smell of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The chances of Cuddy having renal cell carcinoma—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm talking about our relationship. She needs support and comfort, both things that I famously suck at. This will inevitably lead to—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You know what's good for that? Practice. Doing it — I don't know — once?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's no proof she's being stalked by Ninja squirrels either, but if she's scared of them… as her boyfriend, it's your job to figure out how to help her feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House told me to keep you company. Nurse told me to give you antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Tell House I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mm! Tom Cruise got married.  Do you want me to quote from First Corinthians? 'Cause I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As a Jew, I'm gonna have to decline that offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don't know what you're missing. St. Paul was really on his game.  He'll show up eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You don't actually believe that. But I do. All these years, he's never stopped trying to annoy me for more than 15 minutes. And now he can't even walk into the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Love hopes all things.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What is it with you and this kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He's doggy paddling in a sea of misery. I remember what it's like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How far did you have to reach back for that memory, last night? Sometimes I hear you in the living room watching TV at 3:00 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah. If only they had some device that allowed you to record them and watch them another time. I'm just saying… I don't think fixing this kid is gonna fix you.  Yep? We're on our way back.  Our patient lost all feeling in his right arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Look at this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase? How'd it go with Cuddy? Chase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Aah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good thing I brought my ax cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> House… help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm coming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House… please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It looks like we got company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Aah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House!  Aah… aah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was sleeping. What could go wrong?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>Patient lost feeling in his arm while on steroids — rules out autoimmune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So what causes bleeding, kidney problems, and unilateral numbness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if we had it backwards and it's not a bleeding problem, it's a clotting problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There's no patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>She backdated the file? That's very clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hands off. She's mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Clots could explain everything including the numbness. We should do an angiogram of his brain, see if we can find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House.  We're worried too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How sweet. I'm not worried. I just wanna get the results so she can stop worrying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Okay, but in the meantime—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Masters</speaker><content>You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.</content></utterance>

He tilts his face up toward the camera. He’s wearing a jacket and a huge, floppy, red bow tie.  He taps his fingers on the head of his cane. He’s wearing fingerless, white gloves but the fingers look like they were sawed or ripped off. He’s wearing many silver rings including three that cover the entire middle finger of his right hand. His cufflinks and the buttons on his white vest/waistcoat are skulls.</content></utterance>

Two nurses are stretched out on the stairs above him. They’re wearing short, white robes with red at the neckline and white leggings with red bands around the top. They also have lots of red eye makeup on.  Three masked surgeons, in white, sleeveless scrubs, are standing on the stairs. The bright red drawstrings on their pants look like splashes of blood. They have the same fingerless gloves as House and canes that they use to slowly point forward and then to the ground.  Close up of Cuddy’s eye opening.</content></utterance>

They’re seated the whole time and push off the step behind them with their arms. Their left feet go down to the next stair while they do high kicks with their right legs. On the next step it’s reversed, with the left leg swinging up.  Behind them the surgeons dance down the staircase using lots of shoulder action. Their canes are debonair props as if they were in an old musical likeThe Band Wagon.  House gestures as if he were doffing a plumed hat.</content></utterance>

Three people are curled up on it. They wear long, dark red surgical robes. Their masks and caps, also red, cover their entire faces. Large, silver caduceus pins are at their collars in the center of their backs. They curl to the floor then up on their knees, arms open wide. The have even larger caduceus pins on the fronts of their gowns.  Two of the red figures and two surgeons, who aren’t wearing shirts, wheel in Cuddy, lying on her gurney. They are next to it, on it and hanging from it as they whirl her in a circle.  Behind her a few of the red figures look like supplicants, rising from the fog. The walls of the room have large, artistic medical drawings – anatomy, scans, etc. In the center, behind Cuddy, is the staircase which stretches to infinity.

He rocks back and forth as he sings into it. He’s standing on the end of the gurney, singing to Cuddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>♪♫ You better chase all your cares away  Chorus: ♪♫ Chase all your cares away  House: ♪♫ Shout hallelujah, come on, get happy  Several of the white-clad dancers hold the gurney in place, dancing from the waist up, as House rocks from side to side and the gurney rocks with him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>♪♫ For the judgment…                                                                                                           Cuddy sits up, twice.</content></utterance>

White swirls appear, joined by red ones. They spin like a pinwheel. Cuddy sits up. She and House sit on the edge of the gurney watching the carnival atmosphere in front of them. The music has completely changed to match the look.  Nurses with megaphones line the sides. A surgeon and several nurses following him ride tricycles toward House and Cuddy. There are large balloons in the air. The back wall has red and white stripes in an enormous fan pattern.</content></utterance>

House is with the cavorting chorus. He leaps in the air.  He is seated next to Cuddy, talking in her ear again. She laughs joyfully, throwing her head back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Get ready!                                                                                                            House is seated next to Cuddy again.</content></utterance>

White light washes everything out. With a couple of chords, the mood becomes more somber again. Cuddy is seated on the gurney. She’s wearing a white satin gown and white opera gloves. A satin sheet is across her chest, hiding the bottom of the deep v-neck which is edged with rhinestones. It’s impossible to tell where the sheet leaves off and the skirt begins but it is enormous. It almost covers the entire surface and drapes nearly to the floor. There are four Klieg lights behind her.  House is at a baby grand, playing slow, gentle chords. The nurses are in a pile on the floor in front of him.</content></utterance>

She reaches forward with her free arm.</content></utterance>

One of the nurses is standing between her and the camera. She reaches in the other direction.</content></utterance>

Surgeons on the gurney adjust the klieg lights. House’s cane is now a giant candy cane. He slashes it through the air dramatically.  The chorus joins in from this point on, singing loudly. They may or may not be singing the words – only House and Cuddy’s voices can be clearly heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>♪♫ The lord is waiting to take your hand                                                                                       Cuddy takes hold of the top of the cane.</content></utterance>

She stands and embraces him. One of the dancers, in a long white skirt and a surgical mask that covers his face, spins. Two of the nurses, behind him, are holding klieg lights facing up. In the background, the number of lights behind the gurney has multiplied.</content></utterance>

Images of House and the chorus continue to speed past.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your tumor was benign. An oncocytoma. They cut it out. You'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then what was in my lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Once they ruled out cancer, I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics. So I had them test your blood, and your IGE levels were through the roof. Because the lung masses were an allergic reaction. So now you're off the antibiotics, your lungs should clear right up.  I brought you something.  Say hello to your tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Ugh! Wait.  There are so many things that I could be afraid of, and most of the time, I manage to… lock them up behind doors.

I think I'm gonna wait a few years. Oh, and I moved your sleeping pills back in the medicine cabinet because I just worry. Rachel always calls them candy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How did I not know? How did I make myself forget for months that you're an addict? My subconscious was trying to tell me you could never get through this without drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was a one-time thing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. You don't take Vicodin because you're scared. You take it so you won't feel pain. Everything you've ever done is to avoid pain — drugs, sarcasm… Keeping everybody at arm's length so no one can hurt you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As opposed to everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Pain happens when you care. Y-you can't love someone without making yourself open to their problems, their fears. And you're not willing to do that.</content></utterance>
