Ample Parking comes from behind and it’s Ample Parking by a nose!  This is the last call for the third race. You may still wager if you hurry. Here’s your information on race number three…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Out of the way, cripple coming through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Man in line in front of House</speaker><content>Um, sixth race at Golden Downs; I’ll take the two and the four. Hey, that’s my birthday! February 4th, 1963, you think that’s a good bet? What’s your birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Take your time, don’t worry that there’s only thirty seconds to post.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Is there any way I can bet on the six and the three also? You know, for the year? All four horses, can I do that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>He wants a $2 exactabox, 2, 4, 6, 3. Give him $24.  Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ninth at Gulf Street and Park; five hundred on the 3 horse, Seminole Uprising to win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Might as well burn your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ll burn my winnings. Bigger flame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Race announcer</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, they’re at the post. The flag is up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Same race. Termigator to win. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Race announcer</speaker><content>And they’re off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Teller</speaker><content>Sorry, race just closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Damn it! She was 14 to 1, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, fat ass over there just saved you money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>No way Seminole Uprising’s going to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don’t bet on the horses, I bet on the jocks. My rider’s bulimic; purges after his weigh-ins; leaves a two pound pile at the starting gate, shaves valuable time off that final eighth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Nice to have inside information. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is anybody here a doctor?  You trying to cop a feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I took a CPR class at the Y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That would be useful if she was having a heart attack instead of a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Seizure? Hold her tongue down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you want to get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Methodist is three blocks down, I could drive her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just make the call. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How should I know? Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsboro. The doctor’s name is House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Race announcer</speaker><content>And it’s Termigator winning by two lengths!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Since when does House hang out at OTB?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The man’s an addict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Right, but addicted to pills, not gambling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s the same thing! Drug abuse, drinking, gambling – they all fire up the same pleasure centers in the brain. An addict is an addict is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Gambling doesn’t take away his pain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does when I win.  Hot OTB babe, has grand mal and inexplicable bruising. What up with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were just standing there and she started to seize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her platelets are 89, she’s anemic, and she has a blood alcohol level of 0.13.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Hot OTB babe? Obviously a working girl, probably an STD, infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No fever, no infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Alcohol abuse explains it all. Causes seizures and affects her blood’s ability to clot, which causes bruising. Start her on heparin, she’ll be fine by morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Except for the fact that the bruises are not petechial, which means it’s not DIC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So the bruises were caused by trauma. She probably got beat up by a boyfriend, or a pimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s that called when you judge someone before ever meeting them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s a regular at OTB. Somehow I don’t see her holding down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was there. I have a 9-to-3 job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be SLE, Familial Telangiectasia, or even Cushing’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good. Start with those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cushing’s. Explains the seizure and the bruising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not the anemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So she doesn’t eat a lot of meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>DIC brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely. Do a full workup, H and P, and lab her up, LP, MRI – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just, ever so subtly, order me to get her medical history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cuddy put me in charge last week, so yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It was a pretend “in charge”, formality to get past the suits in Legal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Right, those licensing board folk love to play dress-up and pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey, no worries. I’ll let you keep your parking space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You can have it. You’ll also need my handicap placard. Bend over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you make a pretty convincing argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Chase killed that woman, now Foreman’s in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah, we have a pecking order here: if Cameron kills someone, Chase takes over. There’s a flowchart in the lobby. For the next three weeks you answer directly to Dr. Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And I expect you here for grand rounds at nine. By the way, I like sugar in my coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> If there’s a screw-up, it’s your screw-up. You won’t have Dr. House to fall back on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>“Do you wear a seatbelt?” Is that really relevant to a seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Skip it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>How about, “Were you vaccinated for polio?” I think you gave me the form intended for FDR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Will I like Teeny Tiny Moe in the fifth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I went 4 for 6 yesterday. You want winners, cure me first. “Are you generally satisfied with your life?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It does not ask that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>You know; I was going to ask what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor. Somehow that question doesn’t seem relevant anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What’s your excuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Turns me on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah? What else turns you on? Drugs? Casual sex? Rough sex? Casual rough sex? I’m a doctor, I need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>No sex; just moved here. Haven’t even found a job yet. Don’t know anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Came here without a job. That means you didn’t move here, you moved away from somewhere else.  Does that hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I already answered that one; I think it was question number 20-something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well yeah, and I could reach down and get it, but that would kinda spoil the whole “cool move.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I’m not on any medications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You vegetarian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>No, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because you might have something called Cushing’s syndrome, which basically means that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>My pituitary is overproducing ACTH, which is causing my adrenal glands to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What a coincidence. I’m a doctor, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Yeah, I had it last year. They did brain surgery, removed an adenoma from my pituitary.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huh? What did you just say? “You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew, it is Cushing’s, uncanny how you do that….”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Actually, it was Cameron’s idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope, Cameron had three ideas. I chose one to encourage, to nurture –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re all about the nurturing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You need a hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I don’t see any regrowth. You get her medical records faxed over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>“Work smart, not hard,” that’s my philosophy, boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Take that as a no. Anica, I need you to stay completely still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, so it’s a micro-adenoma, too small to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So small it’s not even there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, it’s just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that she happened to have a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Results from her LP back yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn’t do an LP. Knew what she had. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Go do the LP.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Party time. I thought it only took one doctor to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m observing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s here to make sure I don’t paralyze you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>You’ve done this before, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Successfully?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He’s kidding. He’s an excellent doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m gonna numb the area with some lidocaine, and then we’re off to the races! See what I did there? I used horse racing jargon to make the patient feel more comfortable. Okay, here we go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Felt like bone. Does that hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>A little bit. What are you doing? Owwww.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Trying rounding your back a bit more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’re perfect just the way you are. Oops, that was all me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You might want to move down one vertebra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is actually much harder than I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Uhhh. My chest feels a little tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Try taking a deep breath. Dr. House, maybe I should take it from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eighth time’s the charm. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You trying to piss off Foreman, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just let – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>BP’s 240 over 140.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Turn that thing off, will you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Take the needle out. Take the needle out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.  It’s a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she’ll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At the risk of sounding redundant, and right, again, she has Cushing’s. Cushing’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right, the fact that you mangled her LP has nothing to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, it has everything to do with it. Cushing’s plus stress equals hypertensive crisis. Smart move, sending the rookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced DIC. She had a hypertensive crisis because it’s been at least six hours since she had her last drink. She’s detoxing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The exact same moment that I’m futilely trying to give her an LP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Right, an invisible tumor on her pituitary is much more likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What if the tumor is somewhere else? There could be an ACTH-secreting tumor on her lung or pancreas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s awfully rare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not as rare as an invisible tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why didn’t they put you in charge instead of Foreman? Oh yeah, you’re the guy that killed that woman. Get a pan-man scan before she dies of cortisol OD. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine, do it. But when you don’t find anything, put her on a Librium taper for the withdrawal and get her a bed in the rehab clinic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lungs look clean. Pilar lymph nodes not enlarged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cuddy tapped Foreman to run the department. I didn’t even get asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Neither did I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You were suspended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I was kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s the irony of women in charge; they don’t like other women in charge.  What, you think it’s something else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You sabotaged yourself. You went on a date with House, you slept with me. Putting you in charge of this department is like a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re really worried that I’m going to create a hostile work environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe that’s the problem. Being in charge means having to say no to House. Would you hire you for that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You ordered MRIs for the entire maternity ward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was in a crazy mood. Good thing I got a new boss to back me up. Although I think one of those is actually necessary. Better comb through before you cancel them all. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What do you expect me to do, House? Quit? Cry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Actually, I expect you to act like what you are, my employee, my subordinate, my bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, since you asked nicely…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My God, I can’t believe I got more than a year behind on my discharge summaries. Gotta get caught up. Oh no, wait! I’m not authorized to sign these anymore! Only you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Keep it coming. I’m not gonna break. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Scans showed a mass on her pancreas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Looks malignant, probably inoperable. I’d give her two months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On the bright side, it still means I was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Where’s Dr. House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Dr. Foreman’s overseeing your case. He thought it’d be best if I spoke with you. We found a mass in your pancreas. It looks like cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>So something in my pancreas caused me to have a seizure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Probably, but the bigger point is a one-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>So what’s the treatment? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need to biopsy the mass to see what we’re dealing with. Then we can recommend options from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I need your consent to do the biopsy.  Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It was weird. She barely reacted at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’ve had people hug me and people take a swing at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This was more like she didn’t even hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Magnify three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House assisting. That is funny. Too bad Foreman’s gonna die.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good afternoon. I’m going to be looking at your – Perfect. Excuse me.  Need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room 1 for a consult. So when did this start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>A couple weeks ago. I didn’t want to get pregnant. Jake’s not into rubbers so I got on the jelly. You think I’m allergic or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I brought the jar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, I meant a sample of your –  Okay, we have a neurological problem here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>There’s something wrong with my brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh yeah. You can cover yourself up, got what I need. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Smell this.  Smells like vaginosis, but it’s not really my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Great, I’ll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board. Anica’s biopsy for pancreatic cancer was negative. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, I’m gonna give you some antibiotics, and you probably shouldn’t have sex for awhile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>How long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>On an evolutionary basis, I’d recommend forever.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The mass in the pancreas is benign; it’s probably just scar tissue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Good news, she’s not sick at all. Other than being an alcoholic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter. She’s got Cushing’s, something set it off. It’s gotta be in her brain, set her up for a venous sampling. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There is another possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Chase, hold on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How’d you get him trained so fast? Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She didn’t even read the consent form for the pancreatic biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who reads those things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe she didn’t read it because she knew there was nothing wrong with her. There is another explanation for the Cushing’s; maybe she injected herself with the ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen’s. She’s had four hospitalizations in the last four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s had zero symptoms since she got here. The scarring on her pancreas could be caused by injecting herself with a benzene and setting off the seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache; you can’t fake a brain tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You can fake an invisible one. We should check her apartment. Look for medications, syringes –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Venous sampling’s easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And more dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not if you get caught breaking in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So don’t get caught, House.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me? Have I done something wrong or if there’s something I needed to improve on…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How would you describe my leadership skills?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nonexistent. Otherwise, excellent.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s even books in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, either she’s very smart or she has a severe fiber deficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday. Multiple appointments with multiple doctors, symptom of Munchausen’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading. There’s three pairs of reading glasses, each with different prescriptions, which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because you’re looking for her to have a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you are looking for… A person with Munchausen’s syndrome drinks battery acid; they don’t go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she’s crazy? It’s not Munchausen’s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It’s not your call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you think she’s got Munchausen’s then obviously you’ve got something to show the man! A syringe in her apartment, a bottle of ACTH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Munchausen’s patients are good at covering their tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there’s something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Look at the pathology reports from the surgery she had in Chicago. They removed 30% of her pituitary, they found no tumor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s possible the surgeons just missed it. In that kind of surgery, you’re just cutting and hoping –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course! We’re both right! Excellent solution. Everybody’s happy. Come on, step up, Foreman. If you think I’m right, order me and stick a needle in her brain, and if you think Cameron’s right, send the patient home. Either she’ll be fine or she’ll die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Do the venous sampling. Get her consent. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I just agreed with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not because you think I’m right. You’re just taking the safe route. You’re a wuss. Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.  Hey Wilson, guess what Foreman just did!</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Hi. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This is a consent form to stick a wire into your brain. It’s important for hospitals to get these signed for procedures that are completely unnecessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Then why are you doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because you’re mentally ill. You injected yourself with ACTH to induce Cushing’s to get attention from doctors, and so far it’s worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I’d like to see another doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I’m not giving you what you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I don’t want a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Just sign the forms, okay, and I’ll get out of here. Hopefully for you, whatever you injected yourself with won’t wear off before you get the fun of a caring and concerned doctor cutting into your head. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Find someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. For the first time in six years I’m getting copied on experimental tests and procedures. Clinic hours have been logged and completed. You’ve given me four months of House’s dictation so I can finally bill insurance companies –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I only did that stuff to prove that he couldn’t make me miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, way to go! Now everybody’s getting what they need, even House! He gets to play mad scientist and this department runs smoothly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So I’m stuck with this for the next three weeks.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah. Mentally ill patient is right on track for a pointless procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, we get your objection.  Foreman. Are you sure? That doesn’t make any sense, check it again. We got to delay the venous sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why, her urine turning orange?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How would you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Because that’s what rifampin does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She’s not on antibiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But if a Munchausen’s patient thinks she’s about to get busted, she sees pills labeled “Dangerous: Might cause seizures,” she might grab a couple. And if that label were accidentally on a bottle of antibiotics and if that bottle was accidentally left in her room –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You set her up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Might have. It’s Munchausen’s. All this, she did to herself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>You know, just because you stick your fingers down your throat doesn’t mean the rest of us are screwed up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Correct, but not complete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You just don’t wanna admit that she skunked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At the end of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You’re not telling the story now, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, I checked her records. All her hospitalizations were for different things. Brain tumor, fainting spells, skin rashes, seizures… she’s had every blood test known to man and the results are all over the map. There’s only one constant, low HCT. The anemia’s real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There’s a million things she could have taken to have done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>True. Could just be her MO. She self-induces two illnesses, one always changes, one never does. Or maybe she has Munchausen’s and aplastic anemia, which would mean without proper treatment she’d continue to get sicker, weaker; eventually she’ll start bleeding internally and die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s not getting sicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She will!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected. Her white count’s normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No, no more tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, you kick her to the curb with a Munchausen’s diagnosis; you’re guaranteeing that no doctor will ever listen to her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We do more tests we’ll only be feeding her psychosis. The more attention we give her, the more she’ll want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if she doesn’t know we’re testing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House, you were wrong. Live with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s probably some blood left over from previous tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Blood tests alone can’t confirm aplastic anemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yes, I know. That’s why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-31"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fine. You wanna test the extra blood, knock yourself out. But the patient is off-limits.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not a coup. I just want to figure out some way we can work together. I mean, I keep the team running from an administrative point of view; House doesn’t have to deal with the red tape. It’s a win-win.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It means you’re not just sick in the head. The problem is, the rest of you appears well, so I’ve got to make you seem as sick as you’re supposed to be by injecting you with a drug that simulates the symptoms that you actually have. All you need to know is, you’ve hit the Munchausen’s jackpot. I’m going to give you a cocktail of insulin for seizure, and colchicine to kill your white blood count. This will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia. There is one small catch. If you’ve actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia, then I’m wrong, and if I do what I plan to do, then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you. So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room?</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I’m Dr. Foreman; I’m in charge of your case. You have aplastic anemia, which means your bone marrow is shut down. Your body can’t make new blood anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I went back and checked your old records. It makes sense. The aplastic anemia has apparently been developing for months. I’m sorry, we should have caught it earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>So it’s not just the latest white count that’s leading you to feel this way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I know this is scary, but a bone marrow transplant could cure you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>A marrow transplant could kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The other option is weekly blood transfusions, injections of GCSF. It’s a lifelong regimen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t want that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You sure? I don’t want to be cruel, here, but you’ve jumped through a lot of hoops to get this sort of attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>I just want to be healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It’s not so much fun when you’re actually sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We’ll check the registry, see if there’s a donor match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We have to kill all the old bone marrow before we get to the new stuff. You’ll have no immune system. We’ll keep you in a sterile room for two weeks to make sure everything’s dead, then we’ll give you the donor marrow. It will take another couple weeks until it takes hold. You won’t feel a thing. If you get uncomfortable for any reason and need to talk, don’t yell. Walls are four inches thick, lead. Use the microphone. Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Okay. Where’s Dr. House?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Turn it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How long has she been in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Three minutes, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She doesn’t have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No, her white count would be through the roof, hers is on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The body does crazy things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The body does crazy things. Well, that explains everything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She had no fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because her self-inflicted Cushing’s suppressed her immune system, stopped her from having a fever, hid the infection. Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruising, the schistocytes, the anemia…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Explains everything except the white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don’t we try that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re taking the safe course? What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There’s lots of explanations for low white count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Name one that fits her case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Colchicine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-medicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That’s brilliant of her. Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People do crazy things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You injected her against her will just so you could be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She consented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She’s mentally ill!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She smells oh, so sweet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hold my finger.  Grapey. You have a bacterium. It’s on all of us, but the bruises you gave yourself with the Cushing’s made it a lovely home.  Bacteria moved in, parked their cars on the lawn, there goes the neighborhood. And by neighborhood, I mean your internal organs. So, should we put her on the Augmentin, boss, or do you think she infected herself with grapes? I love the smell of pus in the morning. Smells like… victory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>If you were serious about the offer, I’m serious about accepting. I’d like to run the department. You said it yourself, things run smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Except for the part where House went behind your back and KO’d the patient with insulin and colchicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There was no reason to suspect an infection. Even House didn’t think it was an infection. You would have done the same thing I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And I’d be just as wrong. What House did was insane, but he saved her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He got lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He got her to admit she’s got a problem. She’s agreed to outpatient treatment. He gets lucky a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Did you ever really intend to give me this job, or were you just trying to stop me from stepping down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, you’ve got two more weeks in charge. Hopefully the next case will go better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She should have died. House is not a hero. A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they’re a hero. House doesn’t break rules, he ignores them. He’s not Rosa Parks, he’s an anarchist. All he stands for is the right for everyone to grab whatever they want, whenever they want. You tell doctors that’s okay, your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kinda digging this whole “Foreman in charge” thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a big change for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now Cuddy’s on Foreman’s ass, not mine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You couldn’t live with Foreman as your boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why not? People could change, you know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Your white count is way down. We’re going to need to admit you, just run a few tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Anica</speaker><content>Whatever you think is best.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win.</content></utterance>
