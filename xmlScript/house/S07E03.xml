<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>We done for the day, or do I need to find something else to read?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'm done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>It’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>No way. It's finished? Well, how–how's it end? I mean, you got to let me read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Not this time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>W–you at least got to tell me what happens.  Come on. How am I supposed to help with the next book if you don't—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> There isn't going to be a next book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>You can't be serious. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You wouldn't understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> I just can't do it anymore. I'm not brave like you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>But writing's your whole life. What are you gonna do without it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> What I should have done years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>What are you doing? Put it down, or I'll–I'll make you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> How, Jack? You don't even exist. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content> Miss Tanner. Miss Tanner.  Oh, dear God.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Which of these says "I want to sleep with you" more? Penguin or beaver? Beaver, beaver, beaver. You're right, it's too high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What did you do to piss Cuddy off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I can't be romantic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, you're stealing from a woman in a coma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're fine. Never seen her happier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah? How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm... worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because she's happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, because I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, that's—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Ironic? Weird? Crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> I was going to say normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>For now. We're in the honeymoon period. Our brains are flooded with endorphins. Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>In an adult relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Name one thing that Cuddy and I have in common besides work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There's... You're both... Wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. Long-term relationships are based on compatibility, and right now we only have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, you don't actually think she'd dump you because you, what, don't do yoga? Listen to the B-52s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not right away. We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me. With possible goodbye sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So, instead of enjoying the honeymoon phase, you've decided to skip it entirely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need to find something that we both like doing besides each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Right. Or you could just talk to her about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, then she'll start pretending to like things that she really doesn't just to make me feel better, which will make her feel even worse, which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her, and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me.  At least with my plan I get my one a day with iron till the bitter end.  Is there a reason why you're following me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. You're not gonna believe who just checked into the E.R.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>The doctor hasn't examined you yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>There's nothing wrong with me. My maid just overreacted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great.  This won't take long then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>EMTs found her unconscious. Her maid said she had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I fainted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Huge Jack Cannon fan, by the way. Love your books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Really? My fans tend to be overly-annoying teenaged girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I know. All they care about is who's hotter, Jack or Deacon. Like Sarah can't love both of them. I may belong to one or two online fan clubs.  How's the new book coming along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I don't talk about my work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Kay. How about nodding your head to a few yes/no questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> But I'll make you a deal. You finish this exam quickly, and I'll answer one question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>About anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Anything. Who was Jack's real father, who kidnapped his Uncle...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Deal. I will have to go with, why'd you try to kill yourself? Burn on the side of your face is caused by gunpowder, so, change your mind at the last second, or you just a lousy shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'm out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't. We had a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Try and stop me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay.  This woman is on a 72-hour psychiatric hold. If she tries to run, shoot her. With a sedative, if that's more convenient.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You called us back to work because a lady might have had a seizure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A seizure while trying to commit suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> So send her for a psych eval. What's that got to do with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What is the matter with you people? We're talking about a human being who's suffering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. That's not enough. She is also the writer of Jack Cannon: Boy Detective, beloved by millions around the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>By girls between 10 and 14.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look, the point is if she kills herself, millions of fans of all ages and genders will be very disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So we're taking this case 'cause you're a fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, that would be crazy and unprofessional. You're taking this case 'cause I said so. You and Taub do a full workup. Observe her overnight. See if she has another seizure.  You can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Why does he get the night off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because he brought a “smokin'” hot babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I have plans with my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life.  And you obviously don't have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey.  I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Reservation for Dominica's isn't till 8:00, so we got plenty of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We need to pick something up from a haunted house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is a Gothic Revival masterpiece. I hope one day to live in a house like this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your friend's a writer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>One of the best. She wants me to read her latest manuscript.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> Alice Tanner. Why does that name sound familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I gave you a couple of her books a few years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> No. She's the woman you put on the psych hold. This isn't a date. We're on a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ever hear of multitasking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Did you steal her keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think I'd take the Dean of Medicine on a “B” and “E”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>How did you get in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, I guess you have your answer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When was your last physical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>A while ago. I don't like doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Any history of seizures before today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Not that I recall. Are we almost done? I'm tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The exam would go faster if you would cooperate with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>You're evading every question we ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Why do you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>That.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I didn't ask for help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Committing a suicidal gesture says otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>It wasn't a gesture. I had the damn seizure before I could get the gun in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You want to tell us why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You want to know my life story, my secret, inner pain? Maybe if I just open up a little, you'll be able to save me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're just trying to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Thank you. I want a woman doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>And back to being evasive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>It's my right as a patient. So please. Get out. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to observe you overnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You really think I'm stupid enough to try and kill myself in a hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>To see if you have another seizure.  We'll be up there, and we won't disturb you unless there's a problem. That work for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Whatever it takes to get you out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, Christina has agreed to not call the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's probably illegal. Same reason she didn't report the suicide attempt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>I call 911. But when Miss Tanner woke up, she say she will fire me if I say anything about the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And if she whacks herself, what happens to your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>I think she's a very depressed person. Never goes out, doesn't have friends. She has all this money, but all she does is write.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need to see her latest manuscript.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content> She always locks up her writing in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Has she ever complained about physical pain or stress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>Yes. Her back and her hands hurt a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>A writer with back and hand pain. That's very helpful. Let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>Sometimes I hear her cry at night. When she thinks nobody's listening. I should have done something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> True.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Before there were hard drives, there were... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How many of these does she eat a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>Two for lunch. Sometimes three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Still no seizure activity. It's your turn—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Close. House.  She's fine. Both the E.E.G. and all her vitals have been—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You wet the bed. Just not sure how yet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good morning, gentlemen.  Well, if it's any consolation, I didn't get any sleep either.  Unilateral hyperhidrosis. Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She also admitted she tried to kill herself, but won't tell us why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>House searched her home, found she's been eating two cans of tuna a day for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mercury poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Explains the seizures, hand and back pain, also the depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Explains everything except the fact that it's not. We got her urine and blood samples back. They're normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If it's low level, it might not show up in a spot check. We need to run continuous testing to find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We can't. She wants a female doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She only asked for a woman to waste time. She's cooperating just enough to get through the psych hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy. Confirm with another urine test.  Okay. I'll go talk to Cuddy. Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress too. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ahe–ahem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This would be me ignoring you.  What if we got arrested last night? And whatever happened to keeping our professional and personal lives separate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm not the one talking about our relationship at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What's behind your back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Peace penguin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What room should I return it to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>243. I need some help with Alice Tanner. She wants a vagina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm pretty attached to mine. I told you to hire a temporary replacement for Thirteen two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've been busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You. So you'll talk her out of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You'll hire a woman doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You think we just sit around talking sports and belching and farting when the chicks aren't around?  By when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Next week it is. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>What makes you think it's Mercury?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your symptoms. Now I can perform the procedure myself if you still prefer a woman doctor, but the team you have is our best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>That's an interesting perfume you're wearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It was a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>From Dr. House? It was all over him last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>If you'd prefer another female doctor, I can arrange that as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I also smelled it somewhere else more recently. Faint, but unmistakable. You should have worn a different cardigan this morning, Christina. Something you'd like to tell me, dear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Christina</speaker><content>When I found you yesterday, I thought I was too late. I talked to them so I could help you get better. I just don't want to see you suffer anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>That won't be a problem. You're fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>This woman cares about you. If it weren't for her—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I wouldn't be here now, would I? I should have done it yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I understand that you're in pain, but lashing out isn't the answer. Treatment is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I agree. Send the men back. At least they're not a bunch of dewy-eyed cry-babies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's the new Jack Cannon novel. Suggestions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Stop. It can't be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People wonder why you've never cured cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did you get this before or after your date with Cuddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Eh, probably would have been a wiser choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Huh. This is actually good, House.  She's committing crimes. What does that tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a horrible influence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>True. A horrible influence she's reaching out to. She's looking for ways to connect. Sure, they're self-destructive, juvenile, and insane,  but so are you. You do have something in common. You're both trying to find things you have in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And not finding them. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content> You don't look so hot. Want to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Those days are over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Who were you talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If you're seeing things, it could be another symptom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>It's not. It's only in my imagination. I make things up for a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And talking to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>It's a writer thing. We're also good at reading people. Like you, for instance. Recently divorced. You slept with a girl last night. Her place, not yours. You probably won't return her calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> That... How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>The tan line from your former wedding ring. You stink of smoke, but no yellow on your fingers or teeth means she's the smoker. And you either didn't shower or change. Either way, her place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Do him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We're wasting time, which is her main goal here.  Need your arm for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You remind me of my ex-husband. A cute man, but problems in the bedroom department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Not even close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>The ones I caught him in. He cheated on me every chance he could. The first time with my best friend. The second... The bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>BP and heart rate are spiking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Must be an allergic reaction to the chelation agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I didn't give it to her yet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pain, seizures, hyperhidrosis, and sudden onset of radically high blood pressure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Her continuous blood and urine test came back. It's definitely not Mercury poisoning. Clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not. There weren't any blood or protein markers in her urine, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We also caught her talking to herself. She could be delusional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's a writer and a recluse. I'd be more surprised if she didn't</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What was she doing when it happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sitting in bed. She claims it was only in her imagination, but still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When her BP spiked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Comparing Taub to her ex-husband. She really hated the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her first symptom was when she had a gun to her head.  Excess adrenaline could explain seizures and skyrocketing BP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>A pheochromocytoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get an MRI and find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Would you hold this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I meant now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Have I mentioned I'm claustrophobic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Have I mentioned we don't care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Nothing. Just a leg cramp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Get her out of here. She's got metal in her leg.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She has three screws in her right leg from a skiing accident she didn't tell us about. The MRI's magnetic field super heated the metal, causing third-degree burns. Skin ruptured from internal heat pressure here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It's not our fault. She signed the consent forms, denied there was any metal...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Normally I'd say it. Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She wants to die. You cannot trust anything she says.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Treating the soft tissue injuries in her leg cost us most of the day. We also had to replace the screws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And finding a pheochromocytoma without using the MRI could take us a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Longer, if she doesn't stop lying to us. Or we could figure out a way to find it in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We need to make her cooperate. We have to offer her something she wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She wants to kill herself House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can work with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want you to write more books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'm done writing Jack Cannon's adventures. And when I get out of here, I'll just be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now don't you say that, you dirty birdie.  You know, there are easier ways to go than shooting yourself in the head or tearing apart a limb.  And this is one of them. The best part, you'll feel so good, you won't even notice you're dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You expect me to believe you're going to help me kill myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You're the perceptive one. You tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We can't find your tumor in time without your cooperation. So I'm giving you a choice. Give us a chance to make you better, or stick this anywhere and push. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Why do you care about me? You think you know me because you read my books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. I know pain. You think you can handle it, and one day you can't. When that happens, you either find reasons to go on, or you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'm... I'm all out of reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now. When you're pain free, you're gonna want to live and start writing again. And if I'm wrong, got a backup plan to take home with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good choice. If I were you, I'd hide that if you want to keep it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were supposed to choose life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You're also an excellent liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wasn't lying about the cure. If we find and remove that pesky, adrenaline-secreting tumor, you'll get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You better hurry. My lawyer will have me out of here this time tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, about that, it seems that last night you found and self-administered what you thought was a potentially lethal narcotic. Your psych hold has been extended an additional 24 hours. I know. Bummer, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You want to know something about my book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Jack Cannon dies.  I know. Bummer, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>We finished analyzing the PET scans from last night. There's no sign of a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We sampled blood from six different areas looking for any spikes in adrenaline. All of them were negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If she told us her symptoms, where it hurts, when the pain first started, we could at least focus on a specific area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or use them to rule areas out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She'll only lie. We're better off not even talking to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You think you can get her to try to kill herself again? We're gonna need more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There might be a way to get her symptoms without asking her. If writers write what they know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I thought you said it was about a boy Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And his mentor, Aunt Helen, who happens to be around the same age as Alice. Answers could be in the book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Great. You finish reading your typewriter ribbon yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Look for the tumor with the ultrasound.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Whatever he has you doing, stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You told him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>We do live together. I generally tell him when I show up at his work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>He told me it was a matter of life and death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is. Patient wants to kill herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's just trying to read a book, the latest Jack Cannon: Boy Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Alice Tanner is your patient?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>The typewriter keys should have left impressions on these ribbon fibers. They would also remove a layer of ink. It's just a question of tweaking the software, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Does Cuddy know you're using the MRI for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Let's say yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content> So do you think Jack finally hooks up with Sarah in this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Debbie Wright is his true love.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Presumed! All we really know is—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>There are actual patients waiting to use this machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Sam</speaker><content>Congratulations. It's a book.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Wilson just told me we're going on a double date with him and Sam tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't like double dates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'd just like if you'd ask me first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't like surprises?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Is this Alice's book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sam reprogrammed the MRI to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You used a 3 million dollar piece of hospital equipment so you could read a novel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Cool, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, as your girlfriend, I'm impressed. As your boss, you're a jackass. Don't do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>As your boyfriend, I thank you. As your employee, I resent you, because I need this for my case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As your boss, you just got six more clinic hours next week.  So, what's the plan for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't care. Just pick something we'd both enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah? And what would that be exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don't know. You know what I like. I got to get back to work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Found something. It's not a tumor. Whatever it is, it's encased around her heart.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Which wasn't there last night when we did the PET scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She's getting worse, and there's no sign of a pheochromocytoma. Seizures, sweating, rapid blood pressure, and an effusion point to something viral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or maybe a cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We could use your opinion, House, or at least your attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Jack Cannon is not dead. It's worse. Ten books leading up to a final confrontation. She ends it on a cliffhanger. Who does that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>People who want to sell you the 11th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was gonna kill herself. This is the final Jack Cannon. Nothing gets resolved. Who's his father? Who killed his brother? How'd he get that damn scar on his cheek, and why is he obsessed with yo-yos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is there anything in it that pertains to our case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. I know why she wanted to kill herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His mentor, Helen Rutherford, has contracted a serious illness, which consists of joint pain, fatigue, sensitivity to light, and depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How do we know this mentor character's really Alice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Helen dies halfway through the book. Shoots herself in the head... to save Jack from having to care for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>If we add those to the symptoms we've seen and the pericardial effusion... it's lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can't be lupus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It isn't curable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's... not an answer. It's treatable. We'll start testing to see which drugs she best responds to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We're not gonna be able to take her pain away. She's still gonna kill herself as soon as she gets released tomorrow. I can't let Jack Cannon end this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're treating a patient... not a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Retest to confirm. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Nice try, but impossible.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How can I be right and wrong? I deduced the car accident because thyroid fit the symptoms.

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like the way you think kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>At least not completely. Post traumatic syringomyelia from a 15-year-old car crash. Slowly growing over the years, pressing against her spinal column. Causes pain, fluctuating blood pressure, seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And if untreated, eventually leads to paralysis and death.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We woke you up because it doesn't matter. Alice is refusing any more treatment. She doesn't want the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She kicked us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why would she lie about the accident?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Why would she not tell us about the pins in her leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>'Cause she wants to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>By having her leg ripped off? She wants to punish herself... for something that happened before she was famous, before she even started to write. I think the answer's in her old medical records.

<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Maybe Alice Tanner's just her pen name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your boyfriend is an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I'll contact the National Records Archive and run the type of screws in her leg against blood type, age, and anything else I think of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Her first name could be Helen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Even better.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't bother to get up. You know, the way you write Jack always made him feel real to me.  Now I know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Because I'm a good writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's cool, but he's awkward. He's brilliant. He makes mistakes.  He's funny, but sometimes he takes it too far. Sounds like a great kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Please. Just leave me alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You weren't alone in the car crash. Your son was with you, Helen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The books are your way of keeping him alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> Why can't you just let me die in peace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You haven't been at peace since it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I let him drive. He only had a learner's permit. It was raining. I deserve this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> He could always get me to do what he wanted. He's always been my muse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well, that may be true, but I've been reviewing your muse's autopsy results. It wasn't the crash that killed him. Your son had a brain aneurism. That's why he crashed. He was dead before the impact. There was nothing you could do to save him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>They would have told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They had no reason to dig any deeper. It was a car accident. I did.  It's easy to miss.  But you can see the blood buildup here. Your son would have died that day, on a bus, in school, sitting on his bed. The only thing the crash is killing is you. We need to repair that syrinx in your neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>He was my world. Writing... I could feel him with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content> It wasn't my fault, mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content> And it wasn't mine.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Her son didn't have a brain aneurism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope. She shouldn't have let him drive in the rain. Jack was never very coordinated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>As your boss, I am opposed to you lying to a patient. As your girlfriend, I'm glad you care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't. I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, I can see why you like him. I started reading one of the books you gave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I find that very hard to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why? Because I can't like something you like? We couldn't possibly</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because I lied about giving you the books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh. Wilson told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's such a gossip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm not gonna dump you because we like different food or books or music. On the other hand, I might dump you if you don't talk to me when you have a problem with our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know you believe that now... But the fact is—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Who cares about common? Common is boring. It's... common! I like being with you. You make me better. Hopefully, I make you better. What we have is... uncommon. And I've never been happier.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Mind giving us a moment alone, Christina?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'd like to thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Great. You can dedicate the next Jack Cannon to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Are you still in pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>No. You did everything you said, and more. I can finally move on. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Move on where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I want to write books for adults.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What about Jack? Your last book didn't answer anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>The way I ended Jack's story is perfect. Each reader can decide what fate they want for him themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You — but that's stupid! That doesn't make any sense!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>How many answers do you get in real life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is a book. Books have beginnings, middles, and ends. You can't just leave it on a cliffhanger — who does that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I'm sorry. His story's done. There's really nothing you can say to change my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your son...  Was very lucky to have you as his mother. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That was—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, shut up.</content></utterance>
