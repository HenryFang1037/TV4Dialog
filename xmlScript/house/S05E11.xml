<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What? You afraid we’ll wind up in detention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>Well, yeah. That’s… that’s what teachers do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why have Foreman’s breasts suddenly started to droop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Large breasts are a classic symptom of you letting Foreman take vacation days so he can finish his FDA reports before the end of the year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When are you taking vacation? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Hepatic and neurological involvement —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So I understand Foreman’s absence. Your presence, not so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m bringing in a case. You may have noticed me doing that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve noticed you a lot recently. It’s almost as if you have a sexual interest in someone here. Like, say… Taub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, Taub might think that I like him if I stayed, which is why I’m gonna do this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Somehow I don’t think that was really about me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> “Greg, made me think of you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That’s funny. Usually explodes after I do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Alcohol abuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>She’s 16. The kind of boozing that destroys your liver that early, parents or teachers would notice.  Wow. Manual of the Operations of Surgery by Joseph Bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You throwing that away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Twice.  Someone’s screwing with me. Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah. Gifting antique medical texts. Oldest gag in the book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Handwriting’s kinda girly. You got an admirer, House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said, forget the book!  Why’d they pick on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>She’s an overachiever. High grades. She volunteers. She’s a big target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’m assuming literally. Depending on where this school falls on the Healthers scale…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Do you think the kids slipped her something? Their teachers grilled them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When do teachers never know how to motivate their students?</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>What did you do to Natalie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>It’s all my fault.  I didn’t stop her from being a total pig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Your friend’s liver is failing. We’re doing what we can but she still might need a transplant. She could die unless you tell us what you gave her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Anna</speaker><content>Just tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Anna</speaker><content>We gave her some shrooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>We took some ourselves. We just… wanted to make her loosen up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>How thoughtful of you. You got any left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>They’re in Simon’s locker. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This was your idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>No way. I didn’t give her anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Right, you just knew about it and let them do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Poisonous mushroom and hallucinogenic ones are different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not if they don’t dry properly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Get back to school. You better hope we got to her in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Am I going to get in trouble? Should we apologize or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yes. You should. Natalie’s on the third floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Who’s down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Mr. Raditz.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She dropped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not health-related. She just wants to drop out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She didn’t say. And I only break into the houses of very special patients to understand them better. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>I do good today, boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No rigidity. No cog wheeling. So, absolutely, I’d call that good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Great. Thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Your clipboard.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This place actually smells of evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Where do you work, again?  Why would House throw out a book worth hundreds of dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> To make you ask that question. Can you really put a price tag on screwing with people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Can you get us into Natalie Soellner’s locker while we’re here?  House always has an agenda. Just screwing with us isn’t —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Yeah. He’d never do that. Oh, wait. He already did, last year. Remember the Secret Santa gift he got himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He was making us fight over who could get him the best present.  This time he’s just making us wonder. No animosity. No ugly competition. I think it’s a real present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>If it’s real then House really was freaked. If it affects him, eventually it will affect us…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Uh-oh.  Maybe it wasn’t those kids who poisoned Natalie. Maybe it was Natalie herself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I didn’t try to kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then why’d you have all those painkillers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>In case I got a headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, maybe you took a few too many.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>Do you have any kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No. But high school wasn’t all that different when I was your age. Teenagers can be incredibly mean. I know what you’re going through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content> I bet you were cool. You’re pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re pretty too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I’m fat. I’m a loser. They all hate me. You know what they did last year? They took these photos of me for the yearbook. But it wasn’t. It was for this website, making fun of me, calling me a pig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Forget about them. Let’s just make you better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>What’s the point?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Acetylcysteine could save her liver, but we have to act fast. If there’s any chance that she took all those pills —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If it ‘s a subpoena, he’s gotten that kind of present before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That narrows it down. Just look for someone who knows how to read or has been to a bookstore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Most bookstores don’t carry Joseph Bell “On Surgery.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Did it have a note?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Greg, made me think of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Green wrapping paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>How did you know that?  What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> It’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> Yes, when something’s nothing, the natural response is to guess the color of the paper it’s wrapped in and then descend into stunned silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Irene Adler. Christmas 2001. Sarcoid symptoms but she didn’t respond to methotrexate. I’ve never seen him so obsessed. He saved her with a last-minute Wegener’s diagnosis, but the hours he put in… I thought it would kill him. And then… Well, he fell for her. But it was too soon after Stacy and… It sounds silly, but Irene was the one who got away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>No, you idiots. House is just screwing with you. You think there’s some woman with a mysterious green wrapping paper trademark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Then how did you guess…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I could be wrong. It’s possible a secret admirer gave House the same book I gave him last Christmas.  And the same paper I wrapped it in. And the note I wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> We gotta go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Heartbeat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>150. BP 180 over 110. Crackling three-quarters of the way up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Guess this means she didn’t try to kill herself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Well, scratch the hallucinations. That’s from the mushrooms. That leaves liver failure and now pulmonary edema.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And you, standing there, beseechingly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yes. I was going to stalk you at home but it was a busy week and your office is closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Thirteen and Foreman were busy drug trialing and we needed an answer on the overdose so we called her in. She’s just updating us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Convenient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Update’s done. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This is a good experience for me, as my parents never got divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Theories!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Glue sniffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Effects on the lungs would have been immediate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>House. We all know what’s going on here. Cuddy gave you that present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Infections?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>No fever. No polys in the sputum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content> I think…  I think she loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I told you to lay off the present.  and the LSD. We got distracted by the painkillers. Toxins are still the most likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Just tell her how you feel. If you won’t, then I will. I’ll walk right down there. Damn it. Love like this needs to fly free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You talked to Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>He has very girly handwriting, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew I should have just wrapped a new present. You said the patient volunteered. Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content> Uh, Pleasant Valley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Soup kitchen in Trenton. Thirteen, Kutner — go search the home and the school. Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the fragrant and contagious homeless men. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why don’t you just hang out in the video store and tell everyone Kevin Spacey’s Keyser Soze?  By the way, that ending really made no sense at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You had my present for a year and didn’t even open it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had no way of knowing there was an expensive book inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Completely meaningless prank, even for you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Stealing your ice cream is a completely meaningless, albeit delicious prank. Observing my team’s reactions to unexplained phenomena could’ve been pretty useful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Of all the ways to mess with people, why give yourself an imaginary present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Have you checked the prices for firemen strippers recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes.  The holidays. They’re hard for you. I get it.  You see the people around you giving and receiving gifts, having sustained, meaningful relationships. And, since you can’t, something deep in your subconscious makes you create the appearance of a gift. It’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You really passed your psych rotation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It’s too bad you can’t just be nice to people. You could get a real present that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If I wanted gifts, I would just look deep into my patient’s eyes and act like you. “Oh, I’m so sorry you’re dying, Mrs. Moron. Of course I’ll sleep with you. What I lack in skill, I can make up for in…”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You just wind up insulting her. Perhaps calling her “Mrs. Moron.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right, because I’m physically incapable of being polite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Being kind in a sustained, meaningful way? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. You’re trying to get me to prove you wrong. Then I’m gonna be nice to all my patients all through the holiday season and then Mr. Potter won’t steal Tiny Tim’s porridge. I’m totally on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. That actually is what I’m trying to do. And the pathetic part is, it’s not going to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You’re right. I gotta stop being such a jerk.  Oops. Kinda undercut myself there. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>If there’s some way I could help…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Um. It… it was that doctor. He… The one that was running the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Dr. Foreman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>He’s a great neurologist. He’s… a great guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Huh. You like him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Why don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I told him that those injections were making me sick in my stomach and he just gave me antacid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>We were warned that nausea’s a side effect and giving you antacids is all he really could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>No! He told me… “Get over it.” With or without these drugs, I don’t have a long time. I’m not gonna spend it being his guinea pig.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You got that from an anal swab? Man, you’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>It was a more subtle clue. Homeless guy, uncontrollably hacking up blood. Cough’s lasted two months. He was cachectic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Unless you can tie him to the patient…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yes. Again, if only there was some subtle clue like the fact that he was standing next to her in the soup line for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I hate spunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>TB can cause lung failure, liver symptoms… Fits.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>I have a… a terrible headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll get you fixed up. Is there anything else you need like a bottle of water? Coffee? Mint tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>No, but that’s so nice. Usually the clinic doctors are kinda rushed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you can’t be nice, why be a doctor. So, where do you feel the pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>In the back of my head here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, huh. It’s Beccaria’s sign. That’ll be gone by your third trimester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>Uh, I’m not in school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Neither is your fetus.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>How do you… You know that just from the headache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How do I know? I missed my period. I got fat, threw up. Oh no, wait. That’s how you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know because of the tight shirt stretched over the swollen boobs, the salt craving you imported into the clinic,  the motion sickness patch that doesn’t do anything for the kind of sickness that you feel in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>I’m a virgin. So’s my fiancé.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I believe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>Aren’t there other ways I could get pregnant like sitting on a toilet seat?</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Liver, lungs and now, brain. Which has mysteriously reappeared.  Speaking of mysteriously reappeared… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Her ALT’s twenty times normal. Transaminases and PTs way up. She’s gonna lose her liver. We gotta get her on a transplant list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You keep showing up. You also keep leaving. It’s possible that you have the hots for me but really, really hate this kid. It’s also remotely possible that I have that reversed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’s a nice kid. I wanna make sure she’s okay. Hepatic fibrosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Normal complement level. Normal sized liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Does she remind you of… you? No. You weren’t a loser in high school. You had every Tom, Dick and Herschel wet dreaming about you. But she could be making you think of another helpless, chubby little girl you recently met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You’re not really making this about the baby I tried to adopt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Been a few weeks. Just enough time to get over hurt feelings…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Natalie’s 16. I think you’re confusing being maternal with being human.  If we hadn’t ruled out the mushrooms —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Maybe we shouldn’t have. Forget toxic, think allergic. Severe mold allergy could cause liver failure, respiratory arrest and encephalopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She ate the shrooms days ago. There’s no way she’d still be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Unless it also gave her a fungal infection. Give her a prick test and antifungals.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hey. Thank you for the gift. I really appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> I spoke to Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Yeah. Her nausea… She said you told her, like, get over it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Nausea isn’t something you can overcome with sheer will power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Which is why I didn’t prescribe will power. I prescribed antacids. If she can’t handle that, she’d have to leave the trial anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> Just call her, say you’re sorry. She’ll come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>God, you’re acting like House now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> No, I’m not acting like House, which is exactly why I don’t need to apologize. I’m not being cruel. I’m not being manipulative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You said the same thing to me when I told you I was having a hard time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And it worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>She’s a 40-year-old woman who’s falling apart, physically and emotionally. She’s dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look. I know seeing the ghost of your Christmas future is tough, but the only way I can help her is by making sure she follows her regimen, not by becoming her life coach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>You’re not acting like House. You are like him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Geoff</speaker><content>She says you told her you can get pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I said those words but with a particular inflection. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Geoff</speaker><content>I knew it wasn’t true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content> Well, isn’t there any other way? Isn’t it possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There was a reported case of a Civil War soldier who was shot in the testicles and the… musket ball carried the… non-musket ball into the uterus of a woman working in a neighboring field. Nine months later, a miracle child was born.  Also, maybe she cheated on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Geoff</speaker><content> You made a promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>We do… we do other stuff in bed. Couldn’t some of his sperm have made it up there somehow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>More likely, it came from the guy whose penis made it up there somehow but sure, anything’s possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Geoff</speaker><content>I want a paternity test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Tell him that amnios are dangerous this early on in the pregnancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Whitney</speaker><content>Are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares? He doesn’t know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>We’ll find out what’s wrong. Don’t worry. And, uh, I know some things are hard to talk about with your parents around, but kids can be really mean. There are people you can talk to, programs…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I… I’ll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You’re in good spirits. You feeling better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>No. I was just doing my homework. I’m such a dork, I guess that cheers me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Your parents brought it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>No, Simon did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>The jock-y kid in your class?</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>I was just bringing her her homework.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You helped bully this little girl and completely refuse to accept responsibility. No way you came here out of compassion. That only leaves guilt. What did you do to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Nothing —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Stop lying or I’ll take the drugs I found in your locker down to the cops, you slimy little jerk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>This kid didn’t do anything to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>This isn’t about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. You were bullied yourself when you were in school. Take it easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>I wasn’t bullied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Right. The Indian foster kid whose parents were shot in front of him. You were clearly homecoming king. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Let’s try this again. Just tell me —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Honestly, you don’t understand.  We used to be friends. And I’d be friends with her now if, you know, people wouldn’t make fun of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There’s nothing you could tell us that’ll help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Did she mention she used to drink a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>No. How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content>Look, don’t tell anyone, all right? I had my brother’s ID and I kinda supplied people. I used to get her a few bottles of vodka each week!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>Why’d you stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Simon</speaker><content> She got her own ID. Said it was cheaper buying it herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>You can go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>I think we got our diagnosis. Our little girl’s a drunk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I don’t drink. I did it back then, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You could die. We can’t get you on the transplant list until we know why your liver is failing. Alcohol abuse would explain that. The seizures could be from withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I haven’t drunk in six months. I didn’t even drink that much back then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A couple of vodka bottles a week…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I didn’t open half of them. I just bought them because… you know… ’cause Simon was selling them. We used to be friends and that’s like the only way I could get him to even talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Then why did you stop buying from him? He said you got your own ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>See, that’s not a good answer. Remember when you asked me if I had any kids? I don’t. I don’t know, maybe it has nothing to do with it, but I was good at school, good at work, lousy at life. I screwed up every relationship I ever had. I thought ‘why would I want to bring a child into this?’ But then I got older and…  how you feel now will pass. Don’t let it screw up your whole life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>It’s already screwed up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, sometimes doctors make mistakes,  Anna. We need to try twice as hard to fix them. You using your inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Anna</speaker><content>All the time. Go through one a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You sure you’re using it right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Anna</speaker><content>Do I look like an idiot?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, what was that all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Jamaican chicken recipes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The parents said no to the benzos but I still think Natalie’s not being honest with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So she’s willing to die to cover up some boozing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She’s very depressed. She feels like she deserves what the other kids are dishing out on her. I think she either wants to die or she wants the attention that dying gives her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I have no idea why you care so much. Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, the parents just —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uh, uh, uh. Not the alcoholism. Seizures. Totally different.  Don’t need their approval for that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I meant to. Started reading this file and just couldn’t put it down. Let me ask you… That patient who dropped out, the one I told you about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Schmidt</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You think I should pursue it more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Schmidt</speaker><content>No. Patients drop out. That’s why we start with hundreds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, I just thought, if there’s an easy way to make the people who drop off come back, then why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Schmidt</speaker><content>They’re not people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Really? I thought the zombie trials were all completed during phase two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Schmidt</speaker><content>You can’t see the patients as people. You can’t even see them as patients. They’re numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Look. A friend of mine has this disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Schmidt</speaker><content>I don’t wanna know. There’s a reason this is double blind. Any personal stake we have skews the studies. Science is not about human relationships. It’s about results. You know that. You work for House. Why do you think I brought you on as my partner?</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Her heart’s slowing down. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Natalie’s liver’s continuing to fail and now bradycardia. Atropine isn’t keeping the heart rate up. We’re gonna have to put her on a pacemaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Alcohol withdrawal would cause her heart to race, not crawl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Kutner</speaker><content>There’s nothing structurally wrong with her heart. EKG, echo, electrolyte panel — all normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Multiple endocrine syndrome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content>Free T-4’s normal. Hypothalamic brain tumor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Taub</speaker><content>Didn’t come up on the CT scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s hitting all her organs. Could be the blood. What’s her alk phos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Thirteen</speaker><content> 300.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> It can’t be leukemia.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>High alk phos could also be from liver failure. She’s a teenager. Means bone growth and destruction could throw it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Maybe, but it’s higher than you’d expect. Start her on chemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And do a bone marrow to confirm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Why are you ordering tests instead of treatment? Her heart and liver are about to give up. Do whatever you need to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why are you so attached to this girl?  It’s your call. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He doesn’t want us to treat her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If it’s leukemia, even if we kill every cancer cell, her heart and liver are too far gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>A double transplant —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>With brain involvement? The committee won’t even open the file. There’s no reason to put a dying girl through a painful treatment if you can’t save her.  He’s being kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I’ll arrange a biopsy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Mrs. Burke? We are conducting another trial in tandem with yours. Same drug, lower dose. The nausea will be less. I did some checking. I can switch you. Here's the forms if you want back in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What if we're wrong? Maybe we shouldn't have overlooked autoimmunes. High sed rate —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We went over this. Normal complement level. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>So it isn't hepatic fibrosis. Could still be microangiopathic vasculitis.  With high-dose steroids, we might be able to reverse the —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You run a hospital that treats thousands of patients every day. Some of them die. Every day. If you're gonna get this worked up over every one of them…  Yes! BRB</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Thank you from a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>For you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I saved her marriage by showing that her pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Human parthenogenesis? You proved —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yep. It's unbelievable. But I personally checked it five times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>How did you check it five times? The cycler's broken. You would have had to send it out. It would have taken —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. That does sound impossible, now that I think of it. I guess the better explanation is that the paternity test showed she cheated so I faked the whole parthenogenesis thingy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I win. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You faked a scientific miracle just to win a bet with Wilson? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Mmm, more an argument. I realize it would have been simpler to just fake the paternity test, but hey — Christmas spirit and all that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I think you're confusing nice and evil again. Letting a woman deceive her husband by inventing a virgin birth just so you can—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And it obviously would have been more fitting if the baby had been born on Christmas, not just invented then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>It's not leukemia. Seizures, liver failure — It's eclampsia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which means we don't have one dead patient. We have two.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Um, you have a disease called eclampsia. It causes liver failure, pulmonary edema, and seizures. It's also associated with cardiomyopathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Uh, you can get eclampsia up to a month after giving birth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Loose clothes. She's heavy to begin with. It was probably premature. If it was three weeks ago, they could have missed it on a physical exam.  The baby's why you quit drinking, isn't it? Why you asked me if I had kids. Why you feel guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>Simon. He wasn't bad. We were like boyfriend/girlfriend for a while, we just didn't tell anyone. He doesn't even know about…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I was gonna give it away. If they found out at school… I was at the Soup Kitchen and she started coming. There was this empty house down the street, but then she wasn't breathing. I tried so hard, but I couldn't do anything. I'm... so sorry. If I had her in a hospital, maybe she'd be alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The damage to the heart and liver are permanent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>Natalie</speaker><content>I'm gonna die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>That baby is sick. She needs clean water. She needs real heat. She was probably born with a partially blocked airway and… might even have brain damage. You can't take care of here in a place like this.</content></utterance>
