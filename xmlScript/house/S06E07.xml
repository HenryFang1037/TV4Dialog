<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Madison</speaker><content>Sure, lets give up now. It’s no big deal, it’s just Pharmacide, just the tour kick off. Who cares if we miss the most insane party in the world. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Come on Phoebe, victory or death, or possibly cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content> I’m sorry, your caffeine fix is on its way. Will you hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Hi, we’re the DJs assistants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Security Guard</speaker><content>Hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>. No, I said we both work for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Security Guard</speaker><content>You mean her. The DJ’s a SheJ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Band Member</speaker><content>It’s OK Dave. She’s my plus one.  Make that plus 2.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>You weren’t worried were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Madison</speaker><content>Yes, and there will be punishment unless you tell us everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Avery</speaker><content>You’ve been here all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>After the party we went up to the presidential suite with the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It was ginormous, like ten rooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>We had a few drinks, and some weed, and played drummer god on this giant plasma TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Which she rocked by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Kaitlin</speaker><content>I think I hate you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Colt took me up to the roof, but by then the gate to the pool was locked, so no one was up there. So we just climbed over and jumped down and um, went skinny dipping. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Avery</speaker><content>Did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>No. He was so sweet. Later, he played his guitar and he wrote a song for me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Kaitlin</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Jordan, what happen to your foot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Jordan, are you OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Jordan!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Foreman expects me to read an Xray on this itty bitty screen. He should have emailed me a larger phone.  Why are you packing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We’re leaving this afternoon for the conference on Pharmacology and Public Policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We discussed this. It’s been on your calendar for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So has Ramadan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Think of it as a vacation. Nice healthy Adirondack air. Or not. I don’t care. You’re coming with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You should come with me. State pillow fighting championships. Dollar beers, wet T-shirts. In the words of the philosopher Eddie Money I’ve got two tickets to paradise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>House, when you moved in, I promised your therapist I’d be here for you. I can’t be here if I’m there, unless you’re there too. So it’s not a discussion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine.  I’ll let Foreman know that the 16 year old patient with the severe edema can wait. Relax, I’ve got no idea what’s wrong with her. So odds are, not fatal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Still not going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She’s got rhabdo . Who wants to come to the pillow fighting championships? Rutgers has got a great team this year, so glad their anchor didn’t turn pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Sixteen year old girl suddenly has the joints of an eighty year old. Think we can we discuss this for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s rhabdo. Patient gave you the answer. She fell down and went boom. We have to leave in an hour so should we eeny meeny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The fall would explain lower leg damage, but not the swollen hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hard landing caused crushed muscles, crushed muscles release toxins into the bloodstream, toxins cause swelling of the hands and legs. It’s just another way of saying it’s rhabdo.  Fifty-nine minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She’s a credit card kid. Her parents are architects. They’re working on a project in Shanghai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Could you be sitting any further away from Chase and still be in the same room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It doesn’t have to be rhabdo. The swelling could be also caused by deep vein thrombosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She has allergies. Could be anaphylaxis or some heart condition that we don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can’t really be any of those things, since it’s rhabdo. I know it’s rhabdo, Foreman knows it’s rhabdo, deep in his heart, even Chase knows it’s rhabdo. Isn’t it annoying when everybody in the room knows something you don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I’ll test for everything. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He’s and ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Contrast is ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She already thinks I’m cheating on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Maybe this is House’s way of telling her to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sure. How was your day honey, by the way, I killed someone. If I tell her, that’s dumping a burden on her forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> No sign of obstructions or clots. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Tell me what you came here for House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve got a legitimate medical reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You must be so proud.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I forgot. I guess it’s no big deal. I was only using it as an excuse to come check out Patty and Selma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh, I feel bad, I haven’t named your testicles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Word on the street is, you set a new personal best for low-cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I don’t know why you chose to give them the names of somebody’s aunts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It’s a compliment. They’re always smokin. Oh, I remember. I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor.  That’s why I’m holding this in my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Haven’t finished testing yet, but it rha-  Your outbox is three times normal size. It’s not a metaphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> There’s a lot to be done before the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You take papers home with you.  Unless, you’re not going to be home. Unless you were, for example, going to a medical conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I’m driving up with Wilson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You weren’t on the registration list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I love that you checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>But Wilson said—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That I have a case, yeah. You’re authorizing the discharge right now.  That was a metaphor. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Busy right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is he dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the next ten minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Unfortunately, no. He’s in a lot of pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I’ve thought about it. You’re right. I should go to the conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You found out Cuddy’s going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, God no. She’ll ruin everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We leave in two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joseph</speaker><content>Morphine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I’m right here. I’m right here Joseph.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Two days away, you think I should pack ball-y? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can’t leave. You lit a fuse, you need to watch the bomb go off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The bomb was going to go off on its own, if you’d kept quiet. So now you have to either come up with a convincing lie, or tell her the truth. Your choice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>CK levels point to rhabdo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Except for the part where imaging shows no sign of muscle crush.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hi. I'm your doctor.  This is Lars Ulrich, the greatest metal drummer of all-time. You know the song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Good.  Drumstick.  Another drumstick. I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Go on. This is a classic medical test. Hippocrates used it. Let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Come on, you've gotta keep time! Cross over on the high hat. Let's head bang!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>House, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> The chart said her potassium's low. Rhabdo elevates the potassium.  And monkey drums.  Ergo... The levels must've been really low last night. Which causes...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content> I can't move them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>temporary muscle paralysis. Given this rate of muscle fatigue, there's no way she could've climbed stairs and then a fence to the pool. Low potassium means no jump, means no trauma. Tests mean "yes rhabdo.” Ergo, something else caused both the rhabdo and the low potassium. This time start by getting an accurate history.  Be careful. Our patient's a big fat liar. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What did you really do last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need to find the cause of your low potassium. You could have a kidney disorder, leukemia, adenoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We need to know about any drugs or alcohol, anything that might have threatened your health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on, Jord. Okay, we didn't spend the night with the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>You can't tell our friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Have you heard of Stiletto: Warrior Queen of Space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's a comic book right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Thank you. Yes, and a freaking amazing new sci-fi series, and they're filming the motion picture now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a prequel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>The other girls wouldn't get it. Only Phoebe understands my passion. Only Phoebe understands the bushido of the heel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So what actually happened last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>We were with our friends trying to get into the Pharmacide tour party</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>I follow his tweets. It's tragic that I have</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He's a god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So did you guys go up to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>God, no. We keep a ten-foot rule. It's not stalking if you don't go up to the person and bother them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So we just followed him around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Discreetly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He ditched after half an hour and went down to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>And you went with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>Discreetly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We played it so cool. For two hours, we lived his life. We did everything he did. Ate the exact same meal he ate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The rest of their story checks out. The hotel manager says mom and dad were charged for food and a room, three pay-per-view episodes of Stiletto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Are you trying to kill yourself? It's from the same batch the girls ate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>They ate what he ate. And what a hundred other healthy people ate. Dig in. Lunch is on the Adams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What if food is the answer? Not this food. Any food. Jordan says she ate all of this. She's 16, all about body image, and she obviously worries about fitting in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Bulimia would account for her symptoms. We should do a barium swallow for mallory weiss tears, start her on nutritional supplements, get a psych consult.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Why are you reading my program guide? It's not like you plan on attending any of the presentations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I like to know how much boredom I'm missing.  "Patient perceptions of complications in end-stage chemotherapy." You didn't tell me you were giving a paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And that was wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Last time you presented a paper, you gave me an advance copy and asked for feedback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And you're wondering why I wouldn't want to repeat that experience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Oh, look! An '80s party. Just when you think you left a flock of seagulls behind in your rearview mirror, suddenly it's up ahead like an undead hitchhiker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy's going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Did you pack my leg warmers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you want her... ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My God, man! She's not some floozy in a bar. She's the floozy I work for. There's gotta be no radical steps here. Gotta be subtle. We happen to attend the same party, the chat happens to turn personal –.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Like the frog in gradually boiling water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exactly. She'll be red and delicious before she knows it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What could possibly go wrong?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Chase went to the gym five times this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>One of those times I followed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I followed him. And yes, I know how humiliating that admission is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Where'd he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The gym, that time. But I know that something's –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I'm stopping you right there. This is a conversation you should be having with Chase, not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I've tried having this conversation with Chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No sign of tears. It's not bulimia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Is he having an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why should I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You shouldn't, you should believe him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Michelle</speaker><content>Jordan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Normal sinus rhythm. Heart rate's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>BP's dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Derek</speaker><content>What's happening to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No pulse. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Michelle</speaker><content>Oh, my God! You said her heart rate was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Cardiac tamponade. Drain the fluid now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Derek</speaker><content>What is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> She's bleeding around her heart. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Blood constricted her heart muscle. She's on antiarrhythmics, but we don't know how long we can keep her stable. Seemed to be triggered by stress. Her parents had just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did her blood pressure drop during the barium swallow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dropped to 50 systolic in three minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rules out chronic conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Acute conditions limit us to toxins, infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could be anything. A gas leak, arsenic in the wallpaper, fungus in the shower. I'll get samples from her room and the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Talk to our little gossip girl. You need to know exactly where she's been and what she's done in the last 24 hours. Oh, I think – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Convention Registrar</speaker><content> Welcome to the convention, Dr. Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It's my 25th consecutive year.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You might remember stuff she doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>We didn't do anything we haven't told you about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We hung out at Jordan's all day. And then we called a limo to go into the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Jordan</speaker><content>We stopped at Bruce Springsteen's House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Jord... don't joke around, okay? You're really sick. Just tell him the truth.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You don't know?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Wait, you didn't really take that seriously, did you? I just wrote that for the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Man at Dance</speaker><content>Well, hey there, Jane Fonda, would you care to dancercize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, we were just about to hit the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Thank you. Your leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm okay. As long as you don't expect rhythm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You remember the last time we danced? Med school, the week we met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I saw you in endocrinology. Tracked you down to the hoedown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I meant, we met before that. In the bookstore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>My third day of school, I hand my syllabus to the guy behind the counter. He barely looks at me. Just skims the sheet and tells me I'm overly ambitious, I have a chip on my shoulder, and I know how to party. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'd forgotten you knew how to party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I said, "you're making that up." And you said, "your class schedule is overloaded, "but none of your classes are before 11:00, "and no one takes Professor Lamb's course unless they have something to prove."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Because Professor Siegal covered the same ground and was the easier grader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I tracked you down. Endocrinology... the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And one thing led to another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>And then it didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was gonna call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Noo...don't do that. There was no expectations. I was just as into it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was gonna come see you. Figure out where things would go from there. That was the morning I got the call from the Dean and I was expelled</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content> I should go to my room and review papers for the infectious disease panel. </content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Hello? Yeah. Thanks for telling me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> It’s 7:00 in the morning. Somebody better be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My patient, Joseph Schultz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh.  Under the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have happened, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. I just wish I had been there. Didn't hear you come in last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Yes, and it was almost 9:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Things didn't go as you planned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We've moved on to a new phase. I tell Cuddy that I've always</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Well, either she just wasn't ready for that, or maybe she was just surprised and didn't know how to react. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Interesting reflex of guilt just now. Your patient's been dying for six weeks. You couldn't have predicted he'd go this weekend. Or could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> "Euthanasia: let's tell the truth. We all do it." That's a great opening line. Are you insane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I didn't want your notes before, and I don't want 'em now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Well, she didn't get ice. She got out in the lobby. She could have gone anywhere. Let's start with for how long. Fast forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Stop. Rewind. Back. Wherever she went, she was only gone for, like, five minutes. She's holding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's Keener's journal. He must have left it in the restaurant that night. She went back, claimed it belonged to her. She was looking for an excuse to knock on his door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I know what you're gonna say. I'm not insane. Doctors are rarely</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Whoa... I was just thinking of your career. But yeah, if you're one of the doctors occasionally indicted, I guess it could affect that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Someone needs to say what life is really like, now, for people who are dying. What doctors have to go through, the decisions we have to make. Alone. Without guidance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Someone should say that... in an unsigned letter</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I'd be telling the truth. I'd be saying what we're all thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Who cares? The oncology department is subsidized by drug companies. They don't want it run by a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We're all murderers. We just don't have the guts to admit –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And once again, who cares? You won't be hirable anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If there's one thing I've learned from you, it's that I should do what I think is right and not worry about the consequences. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, it's worked out great for me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Keener</speaker><content>Um, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm expecting a notes call from L.A. can we make this quick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Did Jordan come to your room the other night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Let me put it another way. We know Jordan came to your room the other night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Keener</speaker><content>Look, I've tried to be helpful. I don't know why you want to pretend I'm lying to you. But this is getting too weird for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We need to search your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Keener</speaker><content>You don't, because she was never here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Allison, calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You would cover your ass at the expense of someone's life? We know she brought up your journal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> That was helpful. He'd be crazy to risk his marriage for a one-night stand with a teenager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sensible people only risk their marriage for something more serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We're talking about Keener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fine. He doesn't care about his marriage. What about his career? Statutory rape would ruin it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's admitting statutory rape that could ruin it. Which is why we'll never hear the truth out of him. Rufies OD explains all her symptoms. We should start treating her with flumazenil.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I was being subtle about it. You left suddenly. I know House can be a little much sometimes...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>No, he was sweet. I just know better than to rely on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah. I know. I'm a mother now. I need a guy I can count on every single day. That's never been House. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It looks like a toxic reaction. Keener must have given her something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The guy's a comic book writer, not a drug dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's a lot that wouldn't show up in a standard tox screen. But he's never gonna tell us the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not gonna get the truth out of her either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We will if we drug her. Amobarbital would suppress</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's on antiarrhythmics. Amobarbital could stop her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's already dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're angry at me. You're taking it out on this guy 'cause you think he's lying to you too. And you're gonna kill our patient in the process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We need to know the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We should call House.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't know Angela Merkel was attending the conference.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, but you could make the first step.</content></utterance>
