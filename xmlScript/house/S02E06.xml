<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>This is so cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>Did we miss anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>They've got like 11 laps to go</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>We've got to find a good place where he can see the sign as he goes by</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Wait up kids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>Turn 6! Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>That's it! Up there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>Can you see anything? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Did you bring his inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Oh crap, it’s in the car. I'll go get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Are you ok? Your dad's going to be right--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>I can see him, he's right up front!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Mom</speaker><content>Honey, you're wheezing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>Here they come! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>Go Jeff! Yeah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Kid 2</speaker><content>You're number one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Kid 1</speaker><content>He doesn't look so good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh god. Are you pregnant? ‘Cause I really want to finish high school</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You have to renew your credentials!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>They're good for two more months</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Three weeks. The paperwork takes forever. Your application, your malpractice insurance, criminal records check - you know that’s going to take some explaining</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You know; our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Yeah! Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Rice isn’t r— Oh I get it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You're also behind on your dictations</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You can't have your sole female employee doing your clerical work which you'd know if you'd attended the required sexual harassment seminars. Then I'm going to pause so you can make a crack about harassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Joke killer</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>House, got a patient</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sorry, can't play anymore, my mom's calling me </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>We just admitted a world class cyclist</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You’ve got to fire Stacy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Yeah I'll get right on that . Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's loading me up with pointless paperwork</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Didn't know you were behind on your pointless paperwork. O2 stats are in the--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's hostile. You know me, hostility makes me shrink up like a... can't think of a non-sexual metaphor. She's going to stand over my desk with a ruler checking my spelling!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>ER checked for lung infiltrates, nothing there</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Professional athletes, Cuddy! It's like watching an old movie at 2am, re-living all the classic moments. Part where he denies it's drugs, part where the good guys ride in, tests a-blazing, prove that it IS drugs. Oscar clip, he can't imagine how that got into his body! So familiar, so comforting.  She can't handle working with me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Oh right, yeah, she's still got a thing for you, making it impossible for her to deal, makes perfect sense. Except for the pronouns!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>He's not denying the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'm thinking he's actually sick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Jeff Forster, this is Dr--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm a doctor, you're a sick person.  And you are a loved one</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Actually, Manager. We've been together for seven years </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content> There's no way I'd touch EPO. Too many guys stroking out and dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Damn!  Ten bucks for the tickets, six for the popcorn</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I do straight blood doping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Plot twist!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a very daring confession</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>We've got confidentiality, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleeve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Well, nothing much recently. I'm in town for a charity ride so it didn't matter if I won. The kids just needed to see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chamber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I know that doping has risks, I know that it's outside the rules, but I do what I have to to kick ass at my job. Don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Dr House is a firm believer in good old-fashioned hard work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This guy doesn't even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Is the symptom death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Respiratory distress. And insanity doesn't cause it, I looked it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's the doping. Injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance level, but it also thickens your blood. Thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not with a clean spiral chest CT</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Guy's sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber. Over-oxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Supplements he's been taking contain yojimbo which can cause nerve paralysis</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh! Air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Come to papa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>This guy's been injecting himself how many times a day? All it'd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Xenon 133, it's just radioactive enough for us to track the air movement through your lungs</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>My accident on the news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, you made page of the week</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Few more hours and cycling would be as popular as NASCAR</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We inject similar stuff into your blood so we can watch it circulate. Now, if you accidentally injected a bubble, we'll see you get air flow, but poor blood flow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I'm careful man</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>With all due respect, man, I doubt there's anything wrong with you that you didn't do to yourself</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's this kid in oncology, she's got a picture of Jeff above her bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Mickey Mantle was an alcoholic</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>At least he hit his own home runs. He didn't physically alter himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We take drugs to help us fall asleep, stay awake--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We don't make careers out of who can stay awake the longest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Really? Ever been to oh, I don't know, med school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Er, guys? He plays a game for a living. Who cares?  And you, you don't even like sports!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's making millions of dollars ripping off fans</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Anyone who thinks they should pay a guy money because he can throw a ball really far or pedal really fast deserves to be ripped off</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yeah, stupid stupid kids</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I've got an uncle, he can spit a cherry pit 50 yards. He's working part time at a lube shop! Life isn't fair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now there were 3 wasted words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>There is a bubble in his lung. We should do a Swan-Ganz catheterisation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Is there a light somewhere that goes on when I have food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Green for food, orange for beverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out every 2 weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How's your biker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Pumped an air bubble into a vein in his lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The things people do. Doping, Vicodin... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm just trying to function. He's trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys.  Uh oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Trouble in paradise, 2 o' clock</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Your 2 o' clock or my 2 o' clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content> there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She looks perfectly happy. Obviously they huddled in the hall and worked up this circus act on the off-chance you'd be in here</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She was unbelievably pissy 3 hours ago</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm! Pissy with you, happy with her husband. Yes there could only be one possible explanation</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When she's angry, she gets sarcastic. When she's annoyed, she's funny, but when she's frustrated, she gets pissy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yes, yes, I'm with you so far</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's miserable with Mark because he's not me. So she's gotta make me not me, so she makes my professional life miserable, if I can't do my job--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You really, really, need to get some--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh I get some "some" all the time, I always need to borrow "some" money</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Hi James, Greg. Gotten to that paperwork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've been pissy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Pardon me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I've been busy.  When you save someone's life, they owe you forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>You're right. Take Stacy. Oh wait, she'd probably just leave you all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content>How's your recovery going? Gotten around to the small muscles yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>It's not the size of the muscle, it’s where you get to put it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>My goodness, it's like watching Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade. Excuse us </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content> How awkward was that?  What's he doing here anyway? He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Er, Mark is in group therapy for people coping with disability. He was thinking about developing a drug addiction but that would be stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hey! Your  you again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not going to make some joke about Mark being in therapy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's there to say? It’s only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You're making me nervous</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content> Everytime an athlete goes down you guys assume it's drugs. Look, the doctors say it's probably acid reflux.  Yeah, look, call me tomorrow, there's a good chance he'll be released. Okay, bye bye  so is this fixing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If his acid reflux isn't worse than we thought, yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I got to be in Spain in 4 days</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Shouldn't be a problem</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Great</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>If I can just find the little bugger, should be able to suck it out</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>My legs feel weak</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You're under mild sedation for the test, it'll wear off  there it is</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ah, got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Ooh, fantastic! I'll pack his things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not yet, I want to monitor him for a couple of hours, make sure he's ok. Give him time to sign a picture for me, maybe even a jersey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>To Dr Chase, I owe you everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Er, it doesn't have to be that personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Ah, not too many Ebay shoppers named Dr Chase huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Still trying to unload the Barbara Walter spit cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Here you go </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Seriously, anything's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Jeff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You all right? Jeff! Can you swallow?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Muscle fatigue in his neck and jaw. He's obviously got something worse than an air embolus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Because... you don't drool from your lungs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe the problem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The embolectomy was clean. His legs were tired too. I thought it was from the sedation but if not, means he's got something systemic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Which means it would have nothing to do with the stunts he's been pulling</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Lupus, or polymyocitis. It explains the progressive muscle weakness</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be ALS</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's too young for that</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Some type of muscular dystrophy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He's too old for that</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what would be just right, Goldilocks? Full blood workup, including ANA for lupus. And get a muscle biopsy; find out if we're talking myopathy or neuropathy. I'm late for my session </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Session?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Dr Harper</speaker><content> It's all a part of the process. You get angry, and then you get--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content> Yeah, right on schedule. So, when am I going to be done? I need to know 'cause I got plans to make. When can I safely book a game of squash? When am I going to stop being angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not today. I've come for the healing. Dr Harper, as you know, I err, I have a bum leg. What you don't know is, I'm upset about it. I need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>You know House! You know we have a history!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am.  Hi guys</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Dr Harper</speaker><content>Got a Thursday group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Poker night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Dr Harper</speaker><content>Monday morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Book club. Well look, if it's a problem, I'll just go deal with my rage privately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Dr Harper</speaker><content>Wait. If you two could resolve this tension, you could really help each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content> I'm tired of fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content> What? So either I say yes or I'm the jerk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh god, I know that feeling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I took the muscle specimen from Jeff's thigh. Figured that's where we'd have the best chance of finding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>The most painful place to cut into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I assume that's caffeine-free. Wouldn't want to be artificially boosting your performance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh, don't start her up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Caffeine's legal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>All about the rules, eh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's a bike race. A completely arbitrary set of rules that everyone complies with, for no other reason than that some committee says that they should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>But that's the point. That's what the game is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So if you break an arbitrary rule, Cameron damns you to hell, but if you break a rule that actually has a reason that's designed to protect people, Cameron develops a crazy crush on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House doesn't pretend to be some golden boy, he does it to help people, not to glorify himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>So why don't you report Jeff to the biking authorities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Umm, ethics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well you wouldn't be doing it to glorify yourself, you'd just be trying to make a better world.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>At least you can still get around on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>When it happened to me, Stacy was great. She kept telling me not to rush it. I never believed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>She means it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know, but... Stacy... She shouldn't have to wait, right? And you know she feels it too. Needs more time at work, needs more satisfaction from work. She didn't get married to be a nursemaid. She wants a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content> How the hell could she have loved a manipulative son of a bitch like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But why was she with me to begin with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>She made a mistake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe it's that simple. Or maybe she saw something in me, something that she doesn't get from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>I'm not an ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe she wanted an ass. She obviously did once.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Maybe his bike shorts are just on too tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So, by your rationale, House shouldn't use a cane, he should just drag his bum leg around as God intended?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>House has a handicap; all he's aiming for is normality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And who decides what's normal? What if we find a drug that makes people live 20 years longer? Should we ban that because it's not normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Jeff doesn't want normal, he wants superpowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So why is he normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Oh god, you too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's shooting for extraordinary, so why is everything so ordinary? I mean this guy's breathing, drinking and injecting himself with everything he can find to amp up his body chemistry, and yet every test is normal. He's artificially raising his red blood count, so why isn't it raised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe his count is raised; maybe what's normal for us is out of whack for him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well if that's true, then his white cells are up too, which would point to some kind of infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Muscle weakness, exhaustion? He could have encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>That's kind of a long shot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Uh huh, I was just wondering if I could help speed things up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Your client's had a muscle biopsy, a full blood work-up, and he's scheduled for a lumbar puncture at 10am tomorrow.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>When I was a rookie, on the tour, I got a letter from a guy in Wisconsin. He wanted me to send a note to his son, said he worshipped me. You know what worship means? I looked it up. It means to love, unquestioningly, and uncritically. So the kid doesn't even know me, but he loves me. Unquestioningly, and uncritically.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Gee, that's a great idea. I sure hope that EPO's not one of those drugs that's undetectable after six hours. Hey you know what we can test for? Phone calls. Take her cell phone, push the redial button, even money says it'll be connected to the newspaper that leaked your cancer story  Okay... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Manager</speaker><content>Okay, I should have told you. It's not just about the races, Jeff, it's about your image, okay? If you come back from cancer, those sponsors will be all over you. Okay so I messed up, okay, but I did NOT give you EPO!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Had to give him a blood transfusion, he's back around 30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He needed a transfusion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well he was losing blood, so I thought maybe he needed blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Go forth and scan his neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His neck?</content></utterance>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Hmm. Yelling. That might be a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Anger's not rational?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Some anger is. She could have pulled me aside, screamed at me privately. Her beef is simple and well-founded. She was out of control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You're having fun aren't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's in my face, I need to know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Professional reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh, why else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Do you really think this is going to end well, for anyone?</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>After this we'll scan some totally random body parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Fifty bucks says we find something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Find what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Don't have a clue. We on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No. We'll find something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We found a thymoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How'd you know to look in his neck? Thymoma's usually present in the chest</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>All the more reason not to think--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>There are two types of PRCA. Acute comes on suddenly, chronic takes its time. We all thought Jeff's was acute because it happened right in front of us. What if it had been there for months? Maybe years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's no way, it would have kept him from racing. With that kind of anaemia, he would have needed constant...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Blood transfusions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Which he was getting in convenient blood-doping form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He was treating himself without even knowing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Up to half of patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of patients with a thymoma…  I’ve always wanted to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I'm not getting any better. Does that mean I'm--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You are healed! Rise and walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Are you insane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In the Bible, you just say "Yes Lord" and then, start right in on the praising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>First you tell me I've got cancer, and then you tell me that my manager--  What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No, what did you Lord. Thymoma is a tumour in the thymus gland. He's a bit of a wimp, but he hangs with the tough guys. PRCA and an auto-immune disease called myasthenia gravis. MG causes muscle fatigue, including respiratory problems and difficulty swallowing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>It can hit you that fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria. You were doing both as part of your regular freak show. When you took a break everything went to hell…which is not an uncommon reaction in Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>So... the whole thing with my manager..?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I could. Or, 10 percent of a Nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You don't need your thymus. Take it out, everything else is manageable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-30"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Manageable. I thought you just cured me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-31"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic. This just erases the symptoms of MG for five or six minutes  Sometimes less. This is exactly why I created nurses.  Cleanup on aisle three!</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You've come to search my office; you should wait ten minutes I'll be out of your hair. Here, start with my purse  just save me some mints. What do you want to know? My sex life with Mark? My guilt over crippling your damn leg? Or are you just here to gloat because you weren't the leak?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I want to apologise  Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long. And maybe you've been punishing me. If we're going to work together, I need to know - do you hate me? Or do you love me? Either way, I think we've got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I hate you. And I love you. And I love Mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You don't hate him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>We deal with each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Right. That plan's been working great so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It'll get better, it'll get easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I don't know, it's what my therapist tells me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>In the professional cycling world we are subject to what seems like constant witch-hunts. But I want to thank Dr House and the excellent medical team here at Princeton Plainsboro. My hope is that this diagnosis will put to rest any rumours that I would ever--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He needs blood transfusions every two weeks, which means he can dope all he wants. He's got a doctor's pass. It's medicinal. He got away with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Mmmhmm, he cheated and won a game. Life's more complicated than who gets to the finish line first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I fell in love with my husband's best friend. Near the end I was at the hospital every day, and Joe would come by after work. We'd go for walks and try to talk each other through it. We kind of clung on to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>My wife wasn't dying, she wasn't even sick. Everything was fine. I met someone who... made me feel... funny. Good. And I didn't want to let that feeling go.  What happened to you, how can anyone go through that alone? You can't control your emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>No. Just your actions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You didn't do it, did you? You didn't sleep with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I couldn't have lived with myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You'd be surprised what you can live with. </content></utterance>
