<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The guy who invented it says it’s jif.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something happened different from the way you wanted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re just saying that to make me feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was gonna say or, but why bother?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I got you a little gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, so you’re not curious at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Thanks again for agreeing to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Those are Star Trek people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, so, how many people listen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you please pass the salt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it applies to you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard (answering door)</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Guy at door</speaker><content>Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wuh, uh, who’s your father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Sam Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sam Wolowitz is my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Psst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I, I didn’t want to interrupt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Caller</speaker><content>I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Kevn</speaker><content>Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It really is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wow. I wish it was better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>You know, I’m in the movie, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my, I would love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have a new job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe I can do both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think you can do both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t think I asked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>Yeah, you tell him, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And at the same time, not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t that a little juvenile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>More juvenile than this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, let me do it, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, Josh, what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>Why would I lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t you help with the coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I get it. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, I’ve got your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give me back that juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is the harm if I audition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what if you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>From a Kevin Smith movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>Oh, I’m hanging up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>And that was Kevin Smith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Decent? I make twice what you make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like, times two twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How’s it going, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>Sorry, I have a long drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I hope I get to see you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Keep dreaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He did it with a robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>You had sex with a robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not what she meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But technically, yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In a safe place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does that mean, under your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you have a guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t you have a guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>For those of you listening at home, how great is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Sure. And we’re back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would be great, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, it is, Wil.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was actually just a mechanical hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Josh</speaker><content>‘Cause that’s all you need, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You are my brother.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We both know this one’s gonna win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, I’ll help you take this down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a big step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s a big fort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You got yourself a sleepover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who says this is the only one I hid?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello? What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We built a fort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are those my sheets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, have a seat on the floor.</content></utterance>
