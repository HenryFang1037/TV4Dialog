<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe he uses Kryptonite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But it’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And now Ben Affleck is Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I love me some Leo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And it’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Glad to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really don’t know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me refresh your memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, she came all the way here…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re gonna want to take these with food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s a dermatologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I went to medical school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy (on Skype)</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you feeling any better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should all take a trip or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie would love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m in. When are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, Vegas, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now, well, that’s hurtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s coming, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then Raj and I will…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, great. Do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh. Stuart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy (on Skype)</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I said what’s new, but sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who else’s side could you have been on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Glad I could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I feel so, so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, we’re both great at this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. I appreciate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Appreciate that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re still not coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow. I’m impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Apology accepted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Forgiven, forgiven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper apologized to me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And he made it all better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can this wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What trip to Las Vegas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Of course, I wasn’t invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Why are you defending him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, I don’t accept your apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, come on, please don’t leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Don’t worry, you’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, was the fight really bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think they’ll still go on the trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re not going on the trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s very mature of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And there’s your next T-shirt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, check out the stripper pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here’s some champagne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You couldn’t give us just one weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I told him this was a bad idea.</content></utterance>
