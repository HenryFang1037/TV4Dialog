<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, I was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know, midnight, one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re tired, have some coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? You have some coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am having coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And look how irritable it’s making you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.  I don’t think I can go much longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that is so nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ow, it does hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what are you guys gonna do today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that was never happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’ll still go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t think you’ll be bored?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I won’t be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>: Look at that, it is a party.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry I have to work all weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks again for breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, what should we do today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Isn’t it a little early for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have to get to it eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Psst, hey, kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>The Flash (the voice)</speaker><content>You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>The Flash</speaker><content>Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>The Flash</speaker><content>All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>The Flash</speaker><content>You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>The Flash</speaker><content>Here. It’s on the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>The Flash</speaker><content>You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bert’s a geologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>And a joker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How early are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t even know where to begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>My dad built it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, it’s so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, and did they have kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I skipped spin class for this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You wanted him awake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So should we talk to each other or mingle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know where everyone is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, what do you mean she’s her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just go home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You only had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t develop a problem that fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We can’t afford to lose any more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Yes, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No worries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You guys stink.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Does it really need one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you just gonna name all the colours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t care what colour the room is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you’re not, so just drop it.  I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. Sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You trend setter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just the right idea at the right time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you popular girls are mean.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought I didn’t have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was painful to watch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, why don’t I care about anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s okay, we’ll figure something out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But what if we can’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think we’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, pull over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli (on facetime)</speaker><content>Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Great. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Of course. What seems to be the trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But I thought I’d be more excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you. I feel better now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, I don’t really know how to say this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Well, you could try starting with sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Sorry, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He said start with it, not end with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>How long do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We, we’re thinking, two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s it? You’re okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for understanding, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We, we really appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>All right, pressure’s off</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>Wanna see a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Popcorn’s on me.</content></utterance>
