<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  Sheldor is AFK.  Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, I can’t get my stupid door open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright then. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t get the damned key out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thankyou, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny (picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again)</speaker><content>Oh, sonofabitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright then. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>For God’s sake! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Make yourself comfortable.  Not there.  Sheldor is back online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Conqueror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldor, back online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s AFK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>AFK. Away from keyboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>OIC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What does that stand for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but what does it stand for?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, guess what, I’m a level three warrior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Want to catch me up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh my God, a treasure chest, I’m rich!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, we’re all set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let her rip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny (entering, carrying a laptop)</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s what makes it get all funky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)</speaker><content>No, that’s what she said, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you have the enchanted sword?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, I really appreciate this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t patronise me, just get the sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What the frak?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Beats me. They were playing all last night too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There you go, one enchanted sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That girl needs to get a life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny (whispering)</speaker><content>Sheldon.  Shel-don.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Danger, danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No danger, look, it’s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>People can’t be in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I spilled grape juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, wear different pyjamas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Okay, well you were great, thanks.  Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don’t got in Sheldon’s room, he’s not wearing bottoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard (knocking on door)</speaker><content>Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>People, I am very busy today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Dr Dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No she doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>It wasn’t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh, Penny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>You need to get that Dr Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>God, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Well don’t turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you’ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Gablehauser (as phone rings)</speaker><content>Excuse me. Gablehauser.  It’s for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home.  I’m not getting the computing time, am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Dumbass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what am I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll go talk to her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Hey Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t work on Mondays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, get to the point, I’m about to level up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s back online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny (pulling cheeto out of hair)</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Warrior</speaker><content>Hey Penny, it’s me again, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny- warrior</speaker><content>Leonard, I said not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard-warrior</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I’m just a little concerned about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny-warrior</speaker><content>I said not now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard-warrior’s head</speaker><content>Okay, maybe later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard and Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj (indicating Sheldon)</speaker><content>Hey, what’s with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s been keeping him up at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me too. But probably in a different way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Danger, danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leslie (arriving)</speaker><content>Afternoon men. Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Right, I heard you’ve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Well, I would postulate that she’s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do that too. But probably in a different way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Everything has to do with sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmmm, testify. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I’m not touching that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leslie, you are way off base here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll take the bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Uh, sure, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Uh…  Yeah, yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There, problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Dumbass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I’m going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>22.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened to the rest of your group?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Frenzy stance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
