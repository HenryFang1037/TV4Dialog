<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>, too late, I win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny (voice off, singing, quite tunelessly)</speaker><content>Let’s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny (still singing off)</speaker><content>You wanna prowl, be my night owl,  we’ll take my…  Hey guys, hi! Where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and  throw away some chicken. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’ll never guess what just happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a conclusion based on an observation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No you don’t. No he doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No you don’t. He doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s this Friday, at eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You just lied to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s very true.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need to speak to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s two o’clock in the morning</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard (opening door)</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right, it can wait until morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard (following Sheldon into living room)</speaker><content>What, what, what, what, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you’re in no state to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was I supposed to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You could have told her the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would have hurt her feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that a relevant factor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And what would I have said afterwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I’d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was not aware of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well now you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, alright. Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard, …..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you have any idea what time it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I remember symposium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, well, he lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He lied, and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well imagine how I’m feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your cousin Leopold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you have a cousin Leopold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Un-unravelable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, because it’s in Long Beach, and I don’t drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re going to Long Beach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, of course not, there’s no cousin Leo, there’s no intervention, focus Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So he goes back into rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You still told her I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Un-unravelable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard (opening door)</speaker><content>Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, well, thankyou.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay, Leonard </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay, alright, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>Oh boy, group hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh-huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. So what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you’re Bogarding the symposium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, you’re quark-blocking us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, listen…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s okay, it’s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, sure. I don’t see a problem with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There’s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn’t that right Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well… I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)</speaker><content>No, I’m lost too, I think she skipped a step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, look, Sheldon’s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, another hug, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright you guys, good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, break a leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Break a leg. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, road trip to Long Beach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we’re not going to Long Beach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Shotgun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because Leo is a middle child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There is no Leo, how can you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve got a solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.  I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess.  We’ll talk in the morning.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Strange man</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I am Sheldon’s cousin Leo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Au contraire. I’m 26 years old, I’m originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I’ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh…!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. How did the intervention go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, based on what you told me, I’m not surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi Leo, how are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Then don’t ask me how I’m feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There were only two people there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>By the end. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m… I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>That’s never been proven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There have been studies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>Not double blind studies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gee, why wouldn’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah! Funny how things work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your parents made the right decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-48"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>I cannot work like this!</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or… or… wondering if you’re a dude down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You’re gonna do okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Toby</speaker><content>One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How long is he going to stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.</content></utterance>
