<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, how are things going with your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That would be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why do you hate me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t hate you. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys suck.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should get going to Amy’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How the hell did a pigeon get in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You shut the loading doors, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you know what a disaster this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do we do? Should we call someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, how do we catch it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a moth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Twenty hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s rough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we please talk about anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great. Everything’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>I see you got engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Let me tell you a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>You want me to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re just gonna leave him here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Relax, he says.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yup. Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette (singing)</speaker><content>Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I appreciate the ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette (singing)</speaker><content>Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s just excited about the holidays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going to buy her a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then you’re both sad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A Slim Jim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s all I could find. It’ll work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, what’s your plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And admit that we contaminated the clean room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you keep assuming it was me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Should have put it in the bag first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry. She’s taken, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you found somebody you could push around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stay out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I said, stay out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you’re the one who let him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about that sweater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow, you really do love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Photographer</speaker><content>Smile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Santa</speaker><content>Ho, ho. ho.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you want the fire extinguisher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, you have to take the pin out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You miss the blanket now, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>On three. One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, it wasn’t your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, it’s not breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean, not again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. I need to do it. This is on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait, his wing moved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a Christmas miracle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Someone should really close that loading door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So erase them and walk out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can’t do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard, Howard and Raj (singing)</speaker><content>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you like raisins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. And it’s figs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It smelled too much like blue jay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Can I help you clean up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you hate giving gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You got me something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? Well, how about now?  Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you.  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, I did get you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But what about our agreement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you got me something. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cookies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Merry Christmas, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.</content></utterance>
