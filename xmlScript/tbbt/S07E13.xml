<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s an outrage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You need to let it go, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I don’t want a vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna go talk to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, if you want to break up, just say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. That, that’s a big step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, well, before making any rash…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I already quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I support you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on, take me to work with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. You’re on vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I was just tricking you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, wait. Take me with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Too bad. I’m coming with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry. Did I startle you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Wow. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you have this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. What’s the hurry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Really? Do you have any of these?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anybody home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, what brings you guys here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re both into rock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, you forgot your quartz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?! No, he doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He brought you a pretty rock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So? He does that every day. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s not my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess it hasn’t come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Who are you dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, knock it off, Howard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m on vacation. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you sitting in the stairwell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard told me to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. You want to come with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Stuart (on phone)</speaker><content>All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, what is she doing today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, do you support this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I support you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Didn’t see that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>In.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>And out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you see me drinking lemonade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I’m serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I don’t think you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Weren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Sweet. It’s a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Too late.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Jesse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>No, I was talking about your skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Even you, Sweatpants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sweatpants</speaker><content>Free popcorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s on Merton Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>Sorry. You want the book or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So what am I supposed to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Megan Pincus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tammy Cho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Arlene Russel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s how you reject a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want us to talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? You would do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And now we go to Reverse Warrior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did she get you to do yoga?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, take a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Namaste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, maybe we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m willing to if you guys are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please have some privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, wait. What are we doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I swear, I am on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s scary for me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>You’re back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Jesse</speaker><content>I only have chocolate chip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, that sounds even better.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really, really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!</content></utterance>
