<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a stupid question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, um, is Penny here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>You’re Leonard, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Damn, it’s good to finally meet you, son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good. Context.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later.  Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was odd.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that racist? It feels racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ll never guess what just happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny kissed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, who would ever guess that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What… what kind of a kiss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A big kiss. On the mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do I bother talking to you people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny (at door)</speaker><content>Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What kind of guys did you used to go out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? How, how’d we manage that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, why are you arguing about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Penny, you out here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Relax, I’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See? He doesn’t mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>So, Leonard, I’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come here, you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>C-7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not if it has a hole in the middle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A Romulan battle bagel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Knock-knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So where’s the telescope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Your mom creeps the hell out of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I do appreciate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny’s dad (Wyatt)</speaker><content>My pleasure. It’s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny’s that knows how to use a napkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So not funny, dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, will you please let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A lot of people are doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s Camry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I don’t know. That petition looked real to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Well, I’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe I could go in a little late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t I know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Well, good night, son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Like his haircut material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. I got them all cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Which is still so funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I think that’s enough about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Coming. Hey, lovebug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you making this so difficult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then, what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. What personal habits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fines?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’d come visit you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on. He could come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, what’s the point of everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope. He’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You just have to look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, this was fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Oh! I think I got a nibble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Wyatt (phone rings)</speaker><content>Oh, that’s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn’t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we’re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>That’s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing’s bull squirt, huh? Well, that’s very disappointing. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I can’t believe you would lie to me like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I’ll get to you in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>That my own daughter thinks I don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, daddy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Let me finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>You’re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Thank you. Now, why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Daddy, he had nothing to do…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Keep walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Please, please, please don’t give up on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I can’t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don’t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll give it a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Thank you. Now I’m going to do something here to help you along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Don’t yap. Just get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll friend you on Facebook.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how’d it go last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why? You writing a book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa. Where did that come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He never touched my telescope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Way to go shutting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I did shut up. Now you shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?</content></utterance>
