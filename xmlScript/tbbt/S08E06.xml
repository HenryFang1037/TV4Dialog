<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I like your suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She doesn’t flirt with doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s all very professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I started doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The one I gave you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doesn’t sound that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good, because that’s what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, you busy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah? We have to be somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So where should we do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you got a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was hoping we could talk about the money again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, that’s great. I love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You two want to be alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Control issues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you get in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sweating already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How hot is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks again for having us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, nailed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what did you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, do you guys ever fight over money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You didn’t have to say so much more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Without asking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How much, Howie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Was it more or less than falconry school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like I would swing with him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Little claustrophobic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you know any mining songs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just the hits.  Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rajj</speaker><content>That’s pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a little more bleak than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Getting kind of grim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s he?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She made him a chore chart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That pan had to soak and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy (shouting)</speaker><content>You guys doing okay down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you to use the walkie-talkie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Amy (on walkie-talkie)</speaker><content>You guys doing okay down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, just checking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What if we brought them down with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’ll take some Funyuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rajj</speaker><content>Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry you guys had to see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, don’t apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It really bothers him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>Why are you being so bossy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Why are you being a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, this heat is brutal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rajj</speaker><content>Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How’s that going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re not stopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t have to bite my head off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My struggle is emotional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Is it Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The space probe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Raj (off)</speaker><content>They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I want that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Now, let’s talk about your birthday party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you really need me to transcribe this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.</content></utterance>
