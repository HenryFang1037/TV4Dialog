<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that’s just Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So does that answer your question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj (checking text on phone)</speaker><content>Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you were back with Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean like through their window from behind a bush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, why did you get a party sub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>People are coming over, it looked fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your attendance implies it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you know what? I’m not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re the only one who eats them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going, you can’t make me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we’ll just see about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have fun. I will not be attending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re being ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you please talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why are you fighting him on this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I will still come to your meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you taking his side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Man, I’m worn out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess I am lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good. A little tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leave me alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? The only adult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stop saying meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I brought my famous spinach dip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There you go again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How could you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I never said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s going on with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t worry, he’ll come around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I get why he’s annoyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You love The Simpsons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I love Lisa Simpson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. You were pretending?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, did I say something to upset you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gladly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait, what is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you guys want to watch with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As long as I don’t have to watch with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you get to pick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, then you go there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t tell me where to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, just come in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, come on, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I’m gonna eat it all.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what the hell happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, is this not a dress-up party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Was it ever a dress-up party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>May I take your cloak?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So what happened with you and Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I like the pain of others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, she doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She defends him all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She does not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, she did. And human resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re, you’re right, it feels good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Two women, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon (at knock on door)</speaker><content>Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where’d you get that from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>From Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t always defend Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about your weird relationship with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think so. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well just a feeling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now it’s a fun fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why are you dressed like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That wasn’t nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, but he almost died, so we’re cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fair enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That was scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj (shouting from upstairs window)</speaker><content>Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>How come your head has your face on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Don’t you guys have anything better to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never got to ask my question about Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be back.</content></utterance>
