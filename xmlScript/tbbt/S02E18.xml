<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Damn it. I slipped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>– Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You underestimate me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny,  Penny,  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s eleven am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. You’re safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This package came while you were at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have to sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Obviously, not a cleaning business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good for you. Sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Another waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’re going to let her handle my food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nancy. Her name is Nancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you’re just making that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, cheeseburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many of these can you make a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>About twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Before taxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you know about that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s Radiohead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, wait! Will you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, imagine that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm. Good-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There. Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pretty good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That just can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re questioning my math?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Want me to show my work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny _ Sheldon together</speaker><content>Hello. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>W-W-Wait, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hot glue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Intriguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, I’ve seen this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard _ Howard</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, what am I going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, what’s wrong with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>– What’s wrong with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to fire me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No kidding. Two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Look at the comments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We add Bluetooth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We should get to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Amazon offers one-day rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just don’t see how see can pull this off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys get started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Going online to buy shoes!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We only had four servants. And two of them were children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How are we doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nicely done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard (singing)</speaker><content>Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard (reluctantly singing)</speaker><content>Someone’s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny (singing)</speaker><content>Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon (waking up, singing)</speaker><content>‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, do you want some coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I don’t drink coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here, this will help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…</content></utterance>
