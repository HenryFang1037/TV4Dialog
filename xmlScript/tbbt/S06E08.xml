<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you drawing over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you silly doodlebug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you expect me to build this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He probably just goes to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s sad that you know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should figure out where he goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was tapenade and you guys suck.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how was work today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good, I guessed right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who you talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, just this guy I met at school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It didn’t come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, maybe you should tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What am I supposed to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did your boyfriend make you type that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t be like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’d be great. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m quite sure. Good day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We just told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Should we follow him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Hi, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t you know his schedule?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is where he goes? What’s in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think it’s an old storage room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not yet. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can’t you face the other way and listen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t do anything right for you, can I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What the hell is he up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think you don’t care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now you’re just being ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think we’re more like ninjas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj (trying door)</speaker><content>It’s locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When did you learn how to pick locks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How did that work out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on, hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What if it’s booby-trapped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great, what’s your pl… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. The solution to an equation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s paprika.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Voice from Outside</speaker><content>Okay, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Thanks, Cole. See you at school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Cole (off)</speaker><content>See you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought you left a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard (rushing to catch up with Cole)</speaker><content>‘sup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>No, I was just visiting a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>Yeah. You know her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s ganged up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>She told me he’s a scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Cole</speaker><content>Well, thanks for the tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem, brother. Stay frosty.  We’re still dating, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>May I join you, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Ooh, I love English accents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Trust me, it doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Yep, pretty sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard (laughs)</speaker><content>Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s the atomic number for technetium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That stuff’s radioactive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you think he’s building a bomb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, hey. Feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should stop. I’m exhausted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What the balls is forty-three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have to know!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I do, of course I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your picture’s on my refrigerator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s good quality video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How did you get your hands on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.</content></utterance>

You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.</content></utterance>
