<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’ve had this planned for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But you said you were working with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what is this plan you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When does that start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s getting harder to pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Run down the pros and cons of each for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can just feel the time being saved.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is silly. You can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seven? Look at the board, it’s four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, it’s seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s five and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch, it’s five and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Was just doing my taxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Actually, if I could, if I could just check one more…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Already cleared the browser history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You’re a good woman. What you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, that’s right, maternity leave’s almost over. Ah, you excited?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, I’ll miss Halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s great, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ah, of course she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And that day care is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don’t know what to do right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, don’t you think it’d be healthier if you told him what’s going on with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Your secret is safe with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that.  You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you getting sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That didn’t happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You also got a nosebleed watching Up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just do your laundry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what’s for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Meatloaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart made it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hmm, guess it should be me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I can’t do it. They have a picture of me on file now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know, you seem a little upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Why don’t you think she’s fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I’d say, damn, that girl’s fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s okay, now I don’t need butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You need sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What I need is to get to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want your germs around me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s going on? How’d I get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, we came home from work and we found you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Home from work? What time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s nine o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, you don’t remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, check your body for tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, would you be a lamb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How could you lose that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’m sure we’ll find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe it’s wherever your pants are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ah, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, something’s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, nope, not a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, but I did mention it to my therapist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I know she’s mad at me about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, what have you done that would upset her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you just start with the worst thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm, let’s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie’s great-aunt, Trixie, died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I forgot to give her the message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The terrible part is, ever since then, I’ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The notebook isn’t in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s not across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re not going to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But, boy, it is funny to think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You really can’t remember anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Phones can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that, that’s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t even run there, I drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on, I can see every place you went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What does it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good. Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Love you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, you won. Can I finish what I’m doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Something on your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nope, all good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, what is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Aha, you are upset. I don’t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, I’m sorry if I’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. I didn’t want to tell you, but I’m having a really tough time about going back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice.</content></utterance>
