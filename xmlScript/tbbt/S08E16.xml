<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t even let me finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t you just do the test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the interest of science, I’d be willing to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Please, can I do it with him? Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but what if the experiment works?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In love yet?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, babe, let’s do this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think we’re safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The two of us could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, that might be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s the first question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m in love. Let’s do something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we call Howard and Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did he say anything about the funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Baggage Clerk</speaker><content>No, I’m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>I just need some information. Uh, what’s the flight number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Eight sixteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I really did mean first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>And can you describe the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You ready to begin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Living or dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Robert Downey, Jr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, what do you guys want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What would constitute a perfect day for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t mention Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Woman in lab coat</speaker><content>You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ladies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Are you being polite or scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ah, what a room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, how do we start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Uuuuuuuh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ha. Keep dreaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Shedon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When are we going to get robot eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re all alike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You always seem so confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And the wave is gone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Brains!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Keep it down, we’re working here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>How’s it going with the globe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We used the coordinates to locate the cities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup. Got the code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Just saying, no refund for finish early!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m not leaving without her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right, we’ll wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I could’ve driven her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which book are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, Origin of Species.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here it is. There’s a black light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I bet the key’s behind it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Could be somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, got the key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Zombie</speaker><content>Remember that before you post on Yelp.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Today’s your birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, why did you finally tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re making it difficult to love you right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>Great news, your bag was returned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s it. We’re done with the questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And begin. This is kind of creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re not supposed to talk during this part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is kind of creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I meant more like a little brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s getting creepy again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can you believe it’s been eight years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for walking me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just want to make sure you get there safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It really has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>All</speaker><content>SURPRISE!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aah! And after I let you be Gary.</content></utterance>
