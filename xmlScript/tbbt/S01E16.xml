<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s called trestling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Right come on guys, come on.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay, it’s a stalemate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, he can have carrot cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about the cream cheese frosting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>he can scrape it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody’s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t celebrate my birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shuddup, yeah you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, that’s so silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom’s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, see, that’s what kids should have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually that was last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you’ve really never had a birthday party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh my God, that’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard (voice from inside)</speaker><content>Make sure they remember no peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon (answering)</speaker><content>Hello Penny. Leonard just left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. I want to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I’m aware of, and you know I don’t care for chit-chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, can you just let me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well alright, but I don’t see this as a promising endeavour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did someone say party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I suppose that’s possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, here’s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. I’m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anguish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nevertheless we are….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In addition I really don’t think that Leonard wants a…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won’t know which, I’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that Raj and Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Possibly, but unverified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can you just let us in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what did you get the birthday boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross’s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice. I got him a sweater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, he might like that, I’ve seen him… chilly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, Sheldon, I didn’t see your present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s because I didn’t bring one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Told you not to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, you’re his friend. Friends give each other presents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s a non-optional social convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Fair enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He came with a manual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)</speaker><content>What if guests show up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Entertain them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What if they’re women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seen it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, afterwards there’s a Q _ A with Harrison Ford’s body double.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can’t you play him some other time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not if you believe his doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh my God, do you smell gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, no.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn’t buy for themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean, like a sweater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it the geometry that makes it fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Something he wouldn’t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.  Come on, come on, oh you clever little…. Come on, come on, take that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard (picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.)</speaker><content>Oh-oh.  Oh-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This granola bar, there’s peanuts in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh my God, why did you eat it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, it was just there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t yell at me, I’ve got to go to the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh….  The laundry is out of the hamper.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it’s out of the washer. I’ll call you when it’s in the dryer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard (running in)</speaker><content>Alright, let’s go. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny (pointing randomly)</speaker><content>Um, that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay then this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, the man on the box looks so happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift, I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I know I’m going to regret this but, what trauma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so we’re getting this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I suppose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Random woman</speaker><content>Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know everything about this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here, buy this one. Look, it’s the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Random guy</speaker><content>Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It depends on what Bus you have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I drive a Chevy Cavalier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, we have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, I’ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Fill this out, have a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, listen, see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and I’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I’m allergic to peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Is that all you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Get out of my ER.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard (running in)</speaker><content>Hey, sorry I couldn’t find a parking spot, how are you doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bad, very bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Howard (into phone)</speaker><content>Penny, look, I’ve got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Penny (with Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers)</speaker><content>Yeah, well so do I, look you’ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t think I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why, is Leonard okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard’s fine. I’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.</content></utterance>
