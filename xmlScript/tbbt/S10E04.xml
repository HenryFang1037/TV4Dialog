<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>About five weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They didn’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my, this is a big step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you all smiling like crazy people?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s only for five weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t be proud of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, is that a yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, where would you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Historically, I don’t do well with change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. I’m on board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. This is so exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The polite response is, thank you for noticing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, we could name him Blobert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What if it’s a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are we being silly not finding out the sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you want, you can find out right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You looked in our folder?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>God, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We don’t want you to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, well, that’s a problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep M_M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. I didn’t count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re really okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, here’s your key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Enjoy having the place to yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess this is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, please, let me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess the experiment begins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny (off, screaming)</speaker><content>Wa-how, we did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard (off, also screaming)</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which side of the bed would you prefer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great. That’s your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll take that side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Rising rapidly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. What if we do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Everyone said I could do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy (off)</speaker><content>Ugh. What is that?  Why did you switch sides?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be grateful I’m still in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Comfy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know exactly what we are gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh. Can we just have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Inevitable, you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But you just said you wanted to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Call you back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, where did you learn these moves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you’re positive you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wrong number.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told you not to do the worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You were right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, oh, oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who are you calling? Aaargh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, get it, girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Even more not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Miserable and exhausted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I slept great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How? You had the whole floor to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Was that a science diss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Was it a good one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Eh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How dare you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I feel like I should say damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, for science, maybe I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For science, maybe you should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-40"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you want to go to our place and make out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The new neighbours are weird.</content></utterance>
