<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How many?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is that really true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hey, sowwy to intewupt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Did you know Edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you want, Barry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s this for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Your mom having fun in Florida?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s just being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because you have a wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m mad at Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds like a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would she do this to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you could shove them somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, now you’re getting creative.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks again for your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Our pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The place really looks great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I keep telling you I didn’t burn it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, this place looks amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You really did a nice job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this. I couldn’t have done it otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn’t it look great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What is your problem? She said it was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I think that’s a good idea. Take him out of my store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t we go get the food for the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Smart, looks like we’re being helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, just think about something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I think about the spiny anteater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, some people try visualization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How does that work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now imagine you’re holding that pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now open your hand and let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, this isn’t that hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I may have a better way that you can teach me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Amy (in flashback)</speaker><content>Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Amy (in flashback)</speaker><content>Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Amy (in flashback)</speaker><content>Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why would she even do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Make this interesting? You bet money on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my, that’s it. Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I left my pen in there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Waitress</speaker><content>Sure, let me go check on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh yeah, look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So should we go talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I’m not an actor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I’m Nathan Fillion, but I’m not. So if you don’t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. Sorry to bother you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t. I’m naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I just saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Open the door now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pull up your pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>All right, fine. I’m him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let’s take a picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>You bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s it, that’s the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Nathan Fillion</speaker><content>Do you want the picture or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Nathan</speaker><content>How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe they did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You couldn’t get it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow, the store looks great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can you please just let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You could have at least warned him about the furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s what I said when we moved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You helped him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My mom died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What can we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not right now, Sheldon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How’s Howard holding up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s hanging in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How are you doing, Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Still can’t believe she’s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn’t for her, I, I would have been homeless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>One of us would have taken you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I’m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She did that to me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t take this away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you want, I can yell at you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It won’t be as good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.</content></utterance>
