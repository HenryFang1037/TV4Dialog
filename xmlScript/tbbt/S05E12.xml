<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How is this lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How is that not amusing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Next time, you should open with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is so hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How was your day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, are we ready to order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if they simply don’t excite me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, just smile and think about koalas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Has she tried on the vest yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just gave it to her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Mmm, yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some people go outside and do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nuts to that. What else you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How does that work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Glad I could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, ah, right.  And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Child</speaker><content>When are we gonna have cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Child</speaker><content>But we want cake now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Second child</speaker><content>I know how you do that trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you know how to pipe down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Second child</speaker><content>It’s a fake pitcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, we’re going to stick this in here  and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Second child</speaker><content>Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I told you I’m not good with kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, a pocket watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content> Trust me, we are not a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Trust me, we are not a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>My apologies. How can I help you today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, are these real diamonds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What time did you tell Amy to be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Eight o’clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s he doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, he wants to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We both know that’s your koala face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, he bought you this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You look beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right, the tiara was too much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here’s your vest back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, hunting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess you talked to your mom, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? That’s great. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
