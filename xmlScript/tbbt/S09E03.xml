<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you pass the mustard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj (entering with Howard)</speaker><content>Hey, there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When do we leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unhand me. This is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you to put tape on his mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I told you he bit me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It runs on syphilis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and talked about physics with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can drive there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We are going to Me-hi-co.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fun, I’ve never been there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s wrong with Mexico?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy (entering)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I had extra dough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny (reading text)</speaker><content>Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Boy, that was a long night for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We don’t have any of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, Penny, how’s married life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys still aren’t living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Your sweater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your glasses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Your hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Piercing my ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You really never had that done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why? I can do it right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? You have a piercing gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This party’s weird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is extraordinary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think it’s a tyre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s the tyre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am getting too old for this crud.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you change yours to married yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, just my parents and my entire family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about your sister’s wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How long do you think you can keep it from him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When did you learn how to change a tyre?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And there’s your damsel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, this one’s really stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you turning it the right way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go. You’re all done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s a joke, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re not gonna let this go, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, good. Is Mom around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>You did? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Are you happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Very. Leonard is so great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Well, then I’m happy for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It is. You’re the best dad ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Moondance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You killed my pig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Oh, ten, twelve months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You didn’t tell me for a year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>Penny’s Dad</speaker><content>Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, Amy, your turn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s see, a lever, a lever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re gonna be here foreever.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks a lot, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What did we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? They didn’t eat him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. He was a beloved member of the family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The breakfast meat family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Phone, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Try dialing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What makes you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s gotta be something else we could try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>Scientific Principle: Percussive Shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>We will, we will percussive shock you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Howard and Raj (singing)</speaker><content>We will, we will percussive shock you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>Scientific Principle: Thermal Expansion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if that burning food attracts animals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We have plenty of food for the animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is that awful smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that enough to melt the lug nut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, let’s start small. We can always add more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? What are you doing back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We blew up Feynman’s van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My dad killed my pig with his tractor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
