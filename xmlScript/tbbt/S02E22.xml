<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re on me today, boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, spoiler alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I didn’t spoil anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Said the Grinch to Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sure, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, vaguely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why the hell not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nobody wants that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, or you call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or nobody calls anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, good. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know your friend Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>About Stuart? Love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. It’s Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re not going to answer it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would he call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Answer the phone, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No! There, it went to voice mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t you going to check your messages?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It must be hell inside your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Guys, we have a code red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How teeny tiny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But the mission is for six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you notified NASA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what do you need us for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He can’t figure out how to fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You busy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Classified, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Or e-mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Fear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t know what this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good. Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Speaking of what goes around comes around…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What if we reposition the collection tank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It won’t work. No way to mount it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That could work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Morning. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I really don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I said I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay… I just… I kind of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why does Leonard get to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for understanding, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, that’s heavy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you think the problem is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not enough bread crumbs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sure, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, your advice was great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, going slow really worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. Never worked for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That is your name, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, how about that? See you soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s classified?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.</content></utterance>
