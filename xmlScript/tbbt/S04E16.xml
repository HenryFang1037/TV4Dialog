<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know it’s meant as a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s how I take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Your call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, have you ever considered us living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve got a better solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at us planning a future together.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Where were you so late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was out with Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nobody has a disease!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I need a place to crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Big fight with my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still arguing over which CSI is the best?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you offer him a hot beverage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tea does sound nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Priya’s in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on. When did Priya get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not really necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what tertiary friends are for.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj (inside)</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just want to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I forbid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Open the door, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You heard me. I forbidded it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Forbidded it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Forbaded it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Get out of the way. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I have business in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why didn’t you call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me.  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The word is forbade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have a relationship with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Who can’t go out with Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s very nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t that great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wrong answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, wait. You didn’t let me finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Agh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I came as quickly as I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I choose you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What did she say when you told her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is so great. I love you, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’d love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I love the way you say, I’d love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Rajesh, don’t be a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My sister’s 38 and married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hi. Penny, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, bestie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I know. Pretty boring, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Thank you, Leonard. That doesn’t make it sound boring at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, how you holding up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>So, Penny, Leonard tells me you’re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you get the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t do the audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>In his tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whose tongue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, with my tongue in your tail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, indeed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t believe we’re finally living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A little snack. You got any string cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. I, I might have some cheddar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You have hypo-allergenic detergent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I have to take you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?</content></utterance>
</scene>
