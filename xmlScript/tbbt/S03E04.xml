<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This movie baffles me every time we watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hi, guys. Hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re boring people sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Celebrating Columbus Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The parade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s he on trial for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. I’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I guess I could serve both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Tur-briska-fil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, what about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?  All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what’s going on with Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hard to believe, but go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean, he’s getting deported?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, she’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. I lost my cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny (from outside)</speaker><content>Why doesn’t he just get another job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you eating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We believe cows are gods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s happy, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nailed it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Prof Laughlin</speaker><content>Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Prof Laughlin</speaker><content>Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a little early, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Prof Laughlin</speaker><content>Not on Proxima Centauri.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Prof Laughlin</speaker><content>Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, sir. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Am I late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Prof Laughlin</speaker><content>No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Dr Millstone</speaker><content>It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Dr Millstone</speaker><content>That’s just fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT_T customer service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m really going to miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Will you come visit me in India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tell you what, we’ll skype.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon (arriving)</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You want me to work with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you busy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I’m busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Shall I wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, please.  How may I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I reject them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wha… You’re kidding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, that’s what you wear to an interview?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, pulling strings, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You are a dirty girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door)</speaker><content>Oh, God, how did he know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Am I interrupting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Little bit, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Guess I should have called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But he’s working with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, we know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Want me to leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I happen to love this movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m the boss. I make the jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, let’s buckle down and work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I need an aspirin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Top desk drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was fun. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Top o’ the mornin’o ya!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure. ‘sup, homes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are we terrible people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get him, bring him back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Howard come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Astro means star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>English is your native language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Caca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It means doo-doo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aha! So I am working with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In this context, with me means for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, well, in this context… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let me finish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re defacing my work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Give me the eraser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said give it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come and get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You are not my superior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am in every way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Can you do this?  Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you. </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Raj.  Raj.  Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Doing what?  All right, you’ve made your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So you were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s the only logical inference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>For you or with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In this context for me could mean with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, but I have some conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I reject them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll take the job. See you Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, you have to drive me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How did you get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I walked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So walk home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. </content></utterance>
