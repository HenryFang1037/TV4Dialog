<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What did they give you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, it’s basic culinary science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it’s rough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s only $800?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. And that’s my bid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You bid $800.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you have $800?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not to blow on a miniature time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fifteen seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, snipers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ten, nine, eight…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where are your snipers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Snipe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Snipe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Snipe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>SNIPE!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aaaa-aw!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You lucky duck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand why no-one else bid.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did the listing actually say miniature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How are we going to get it upstairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby’s broken.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, guys, push.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj (off)</speaker><content>I can’t feel my fingers, hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny (coming out of her apartment)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)</speaker><content>Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s… you know, time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, just give us a few minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re joking, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Talk about your chick magnets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s got a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seconded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was going to put down a towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Twice a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, every other month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, when it’s your turn you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, how far into the future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Again, time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My turn!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, it’s two in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if I knocked you unconscious right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It won’t change the past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But it would make the present so much nicer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you upset about something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was your first clue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes I’m upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow, I’m on fire tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for pointing it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Those are movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, guys, push.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny (coming out of her apartment)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)</speaker><content>Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem.  Hang on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But, what about your time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some things are more important than toys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s still my turn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not about money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj (entering)</speaker><content>We brought food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I don’t want it any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just… personal reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, do you want to buy me out or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I paid two hundred dollars for my share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not for long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Too bad, I called dibs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well you can’t just call dibs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Will you forget dibs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the number, I’ll match it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the exchange rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>None of your business. Take it or leave it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Howard (on phone)</speaker><content>Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.</content></utterance>
