<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I submitted you a notarised list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got you your own room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vintage? Be specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t own a pocket watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Except I’ll be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you think, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m so glad you like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye.  That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Happy Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got you a little something, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Should we take this little party to the bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Man in seat behind</speaker><content>Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We gotta get her to a vet right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do another one, do another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many trains have you been on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Your life’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why do I even try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m gonna fix this right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Just make it look like an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great. Now there’s two of ’em.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Lady Vet</speaker><content>How much chocolate did she eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A whole box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So the point is I may have saved her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Maybe to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>How big a box of chocolate was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you know how much gas is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>You’re the owner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Got it. Should have been a dentist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Trick question. There never was one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Or was there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Better than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never want this day to end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s feeling like it never will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It wasn’t cheap. It was free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re really sorry. It was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think there’s something going on between the two of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I had a little to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How long should we stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I saw a Thai place next door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How’s she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How is everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>My pleasure. Have a nice night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, thank you for all your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Oh, do you guys own any pets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Vet</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>You guys missed a pretty great time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>It was crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, give it a rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leave.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That was nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you want to come with me?</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, give it a go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Additional data. You dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.</content></utterance>
