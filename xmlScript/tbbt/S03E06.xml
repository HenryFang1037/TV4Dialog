<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Kites ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Kites ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>All three</speaker><content>Kites, ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>The three guys</speaker><content>Kites, ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re heading out for some kite fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kite fighting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to come watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Football, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, this sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that certainly would suck.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa! Did you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>See what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That chick, she smiled at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, she didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, scissors, scissors!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold my line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Victory!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how kind of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I totally had a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How was your football party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was pretty good. We won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m glad to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure you have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Another football game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They have them every week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did not know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You wanted to meet my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But I had a shot with that jogger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sacks, sacks…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh… Scrimmage…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon knows football?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Apparently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you could teach me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Football or chicken-fried meats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please, I’m asking you as a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you making this a tier one friendship request?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really appreciate this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s wrong with a football jersey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How would you put it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, like you said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good-Bye, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s funny about Cylon toast?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I brought you a little gift. New kite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stipulated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Did not know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How much beer have you had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>None, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Guy in baseball hat</speaker><content>Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Second guy</speaker><content>Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here, have some pizza, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. I just need you stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There’s some in the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>On Earth, we say thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mimesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I guess so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Until half time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you’re kidding me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. Go ahead.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, in this case, I think she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
