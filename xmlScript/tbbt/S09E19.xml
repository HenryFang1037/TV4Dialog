<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I didn’t understand your e-mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, is that a yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, but I like this computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Get a new computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Get a new computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?  Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how’s it goin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is there anything we can do to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can we really help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll show you how to do one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got here as quickly as I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You got emotional when that lab monkey died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We had a full spool yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m kind of getting into the groove here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so what is solder?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whatch me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I thought you might like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Or you could just look into my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, but he said you can get store credit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But why wouldn’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can we please change the subject?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It might be easier to show you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’d have to take your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry, we can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, hang on. What movie is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about the girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Where are the guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Since when do you work on weekends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You were home alone and had no one to play with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not with Lightning McQueen here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think we’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj (from outside)</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Will you please tell me where we’re going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m driving the car. I need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we gonna tell the girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean without lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And now you’ve made it a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)</speaker><content>Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They bought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you’re good at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I lie a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who are you texting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj. He really wants to see this movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’ll never make it in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. I want to make him feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Raj (at the workshop)</speaker><content>Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Un-freakin’ believable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why do you have a storage unit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How long have you had it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you want me to hold that computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have sporting equipment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, why do you feel you need to save these things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. I get it. I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not a contest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here they come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Go hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, what’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, we did a stupid thing.</content></utterance>
