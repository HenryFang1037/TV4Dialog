<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sceme</speaker><content>The apartment</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, your tag’s sticking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like, two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Now I feel a little gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re only making it seem more real for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about Penny’s depressing acting career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I borrow it when you’re done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She does. 42 minutes in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So are you really not gonna do this movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think we’re gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I work at the same university you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think we’re gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ha-a-a. Still funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That was ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was there. It was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks for walking me to my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whatever happened with your online dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s true. Do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. How do you propose we move forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Amy, I could use some help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great, so what do you need me for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. Powerful stuff, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not gonna pretend to be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, what would I say to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are we playing individual or teams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Teams are fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I really don’t think we do tha…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do that. See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Plane tickets? Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Will you please sto…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stop that? Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, you busy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Have you heard back from Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s happening tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m meeting her for coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is gonna be a long weekend for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re the reason I’m doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You excited for Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very much so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, who’s the real astronaut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Buzz Aldrin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Yay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Howard?  Howard?  Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You just went to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, it still doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you getting annoyed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I still need to use the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m gonna need that bag back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You sure you want to do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just so humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I thought we’d take yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.</content></utterance>
