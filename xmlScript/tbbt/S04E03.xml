<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’m ready for my next question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uganda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Defend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Correct. My turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Tuned bayonets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Defend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. My apologies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell are you guys playing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is he always like this when he loses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You bumped the table and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>On the potty? What are you, five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a potty. What do you call it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, and potty is okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If I don’t have to boom-boom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry we’re late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe she’s experiencing her menses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, look, it’s Shamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shamy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All righty. What’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, tell us about your work, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, not my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So we already have you for all that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Suffered in silence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Silence?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Philadelphia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? I thought they were out West someplace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get one yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God, he’s an ass when he drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what’d he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kinda, sorta had to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t agree with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you defended me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re not doing that right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gimme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, that is better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, God, never again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was homesick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s very offensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, we all thought so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>John and Yoko.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>More like Yoko and Yoko.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Greetings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s very impressive, for theoretical work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do I detect a hint of condescension?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard and Howard together</speaker><content>Oooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You take that back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We appear to have reached an impasse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Seconded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There being no objections…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>All</speaker><content>No, uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good day, Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amen to that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hear you broke up with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Regarding what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t follow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What does hit a reef mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, went splitsville.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Pardon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Turned to boom-boom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think Sheldon really misses Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He got a cat to keep him company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He takes the kitty to the potty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought we discussed the P-word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.  Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Zazzles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Clowder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t break up, she dumped you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was there. She dumped you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s in his bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, she’s real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Did they sin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I’ve seen him at his best, I’ve seen him at his worst. There’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on to that thought. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>My, my, that’s a powerful smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute Jewish names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it’s creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You should have called sooner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly! Dinner’s ready!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Coming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>No cats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw. What is she doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I called her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard (pretending to sneeze)</speaker><content>25 cats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let’s talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Then stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, Shelly, I can’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excellent point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A physics point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Touche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn’t have to end it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll go as high as 40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sixty-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like to see my cats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I saw what you did there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>He thinks he’s such a smarty pants. He’s no different from any man. You tell ’em not to do something, that’s all they want to do. If I hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward. Now, don’t you move. I’ll bring over all the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, I can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, isn’t that sweet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Next!</content></utterance>
