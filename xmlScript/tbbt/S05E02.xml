<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound like mocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A hobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t you like Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course I like Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s the difference. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, that’s Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Priya (on screen)</speaker><content>Hi, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I miss you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A good wife would go to the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I want a divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s great, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon (jumps up)</speaker><content>Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been sitting in garbage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, take it easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You take it easy! I need to use your shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I went into this marriage with so much hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hand me the tuna melt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not easy, but we’re making it work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How can you be so racist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just his head, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Name one time I’ve ever done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. It is a comfortable chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s like living with a Chihuahua.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon (at Penny’s door)</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up, buttercup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have to get rid of the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the word, hummingbird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the gist, physicist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. .  Penny.  Penny.   Penny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, here we are. Back in bed together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Priya (on laptop screen)</speaker><content>Yep, here we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>That’s terrible. Try again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Yes, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>God, Leonard, stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, like usual. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Take off your shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I said be quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Now take off your shorts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cool.  Uh-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Here I am, baby. You miss these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, damn it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard! Already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, how are your mom and dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Sure, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Sheldon (calling from outside)</speaker><content>If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Sheldon (still off)</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is not. Is not, is not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re good friends with Penny, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, name your price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean like Salt Lake City?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Will you listen to me play my harp now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past.  I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know about this, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll try it. Like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Close. Really French it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, you got it, you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa! You just bit my tongue!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, I nibbled. I was being playful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you have to make everything weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. Better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And now me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I just have one question about the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, he didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, he did. He absolutely did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Amy (between screams)</speaker><content>I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny (also still screaming)</speaker><content>Yeah, sure!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Priya (on screen)</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, listen…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.</content></utterance>
