<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what’s your news, Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Congratulations, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj (earphones in, singing)</speaker><content>Oh, if there was a problem, you can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Priya (off)</speaker><content>Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Priya (off)</speaker><content>Shh, my brother’s going to hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Priya (off)</speaker><content>I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, gotta go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, Ma! It’s Raj!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>He’s a doctor too, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Well, whose fault is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I guess that’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Of course, he and I can play doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you considered massage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rotating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean the myofascial point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s someone at my door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj (at door)</speaker><content>Can I sleep here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can’t authorize that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good night, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never kid about safety.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In my bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you heard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Scotty, I need more power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I bring girls here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just not against their will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you really think you should be eating that cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Until you have kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When did you take my blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What the hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This says you can make end of life decisions for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you sign this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that seems fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No backsies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, dinner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is the difference between eating and dining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny (at door)</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a good thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I wanted to. Come on, open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>More wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Monkeys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When does a monkey have a trunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>When a suitcase just won’t do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Every night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you poor baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s wrong with me, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>To friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm. Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Priya (computer tone)</speaker><content>That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When is the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>Where is your brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Out with friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.</content></utterance>
