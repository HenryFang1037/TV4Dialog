<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How are you settling in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I’ll tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I miss you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry you had to go through that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know you just split an infinitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you gonna do about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going to admonish you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Vigorously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the only kind of admonishing I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’s Sheldon doing with Amy gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, the last three nights I’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I’m doing with Amy gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How are you doing with…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’d like, we can help you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, not me, I’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was a tutorial. And yes, I’m happy to keep Sheldon company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, why does he need a ladder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, She’s back at Caltech for her postdoc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ramona Nowitzki</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. I love those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s sit somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So what do you guys think that’s about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Knowing Sheldon, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Not ’til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He just made her laugh, something’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you see the way she’s looking at him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That ain’t Sheldon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did he Purell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Should we call Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, then we agree. He’s not making any moves, it’s this Dr. Ramona chick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sounds like a big night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who’s he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Huge fan, you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s terrific. I’ll call you right back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny (answering skype)</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Which he only did once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why didn’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We didn’t want you to worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Should I worry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Come on, it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what do you want us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nice try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. I was scrambling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can you even eat those things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sounds like a lot of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Eh, I’m worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s not that kind of doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. Well, her loss. I’ve been called a genuine medical oddity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I was going to suggest me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Anybody’s better than, mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Good to see you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>May I join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should call Guinness, that might be a record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper, over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I could have made her very happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You kept walking. I think you did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you really think there’s reason to worry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s definitely going after Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I made a play for her and she shot me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, that doesn’t prove anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like, really, a million?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine, hundreds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We just went swimming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you actually got in a pool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was scared, but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I was proud of him, a lot of people don’t put their face in the water on the first day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can I just squeeze in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can’t wait to meet her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>No, my work doesn’t leave me a lot of time for relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think you made that very clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She was part of the American team at CERN.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know, I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll get them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Well, hang on, I’ll come with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, fun. Like a play date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think you should call Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Are these all from Peter Higgs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was missing you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She’s what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>So nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Hang on.  Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? We both think so.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got feet and legs, you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Will you go with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You done trying to make yourself feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. I haven’t played the race card yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>It was nice seeing everybody. Thank you for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Our pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Walk me to my car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’ll all go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pardon. I just need to., yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I already do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, then you get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let’s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. What do you think is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t look at me like that, I tried.</content></utterance>
