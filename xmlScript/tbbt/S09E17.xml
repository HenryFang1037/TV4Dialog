<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Way to narrow it down to everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, where’s that information been this whole time?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll check his room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry I brought it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One day. Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you please just tell me why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, poor thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You realize none of those things would happen now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we live here, so we have no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s funny. Let’s do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You mean, some guy in a lame suit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can I get his contact info?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, what about music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No music it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What kind of cake do you like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t say that to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t say that to anyone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, no, no. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You, you’re pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sounds like something a member of the group might know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Adam West</speaker><content>Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>What’s an Affleck?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. You had a party for your 60th?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>And I never did thank you for that, dear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. Oh. Wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I just, I got a little light-headed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, do you need a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Happy birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Speech! Speech!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Batman finally came to your party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Happy birthday, Sherman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>I still get paid, don’t I?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Again, no offence, but so have I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he’s seen me without pants on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Again, no…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do you know I’m not using the facilities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think I can go back out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, everyone will think I’m weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Barry (knocking)</speaker><content>Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leslie Winkle</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>It’s been a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Has it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you’d be living with Sheldon forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the woose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Barry, stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously, Barry, stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Happy birthday, dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? You gotta be kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Happy birthday, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. That, that was wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, everybody, listen up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You nailed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Stephen Hawking (on Skype)</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Stephen</speaker><content>Happy birthday to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-46"><speaker>Stephen</speaker><content>Happy birthday to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-48"><speaker>Stephen</speaker><content>Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-50"><speaker>Stephen</speaker><content>I was crushing it, but all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-51"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-54"><speaker>Stephen</speaker><content>And a one, and a two…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-55"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Happy birthday to you,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-56"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>So, who’s taking me home?</content></utterance>
