<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is nice, that we all get to eat together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just got a part on a TV show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? That’s great. Guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yay, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s your part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So it, it’s just flirting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t see why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we bring anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, do you think I’m funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I’m hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I take it back. That was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are possums cute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You mean like fatties and uggos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Or maybe just stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Or just keep dating the possum.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Voice on television</speaker><content>Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Second voice</speaker><content>No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>I guess it’s you and me, kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Mark Harmon on TV</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>I’m trying to make peace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Mark Harmon on TV</speaker><content>We’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Mark Harmon on TV</speaker><content>Really? Because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They must’ve cut it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That stinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sure you were great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny (on phone)</speaker><content>No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then what did you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Honestly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, honestly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How could you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should’ve let Sheldon come.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>BRAIN LESIONS!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…  Okay, that’s pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>How about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>We’ll find somebody else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kumquat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All of them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You didn’t get your part cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Voice on TV</speaker><content>All right, baby, here’s the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Can we talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you serious? For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The new Star Wars movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? How did you manage that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where’s Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you have me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you seriously just say um?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is not what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s in the mood to laugh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I used science to construct the perfect joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, I just need to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Should I follow you?</content></utterance>
