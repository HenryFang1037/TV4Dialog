<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t post that, be supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re smart. I’m sure we can think of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to let him live here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, we’re smarter than that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know our apartment’s small, but I think we can make room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re a good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re an even better husband.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sounds awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s hope he thinks so, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj (answering phone)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I cannot thank you enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It is our pleasure.  Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that’s so generous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s the least we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. We barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have a loofah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Why are you asking all these questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, Leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Go live there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But you made the garage sound so fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s it for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Roofing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, for a little while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about his dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that’s acceptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If real dogs gave me buttons, I’d like them, too. Well, I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And what is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t listen to them. What’s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But you are, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m outraged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And there is the love of which I speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I realize it’s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I’m feeling a bit replaced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I get anyone anything at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, you don’t have to serve us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was really no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not for you, box of towels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, thanks again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look at that. You’ve got a Raj, we’ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A housewarming gift for Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj’s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Perfect timing. Food’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. I already asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I’m sure you will, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This means a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you believe this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought that was gonna break the other way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How come he can say it and I can’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just keep walking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Beverley (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Honestly, I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I just say that because he prattles. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Very well, but, uh, if you don’t mind, I’d still like to pause for effect. Now, you’ve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you’re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hadn’t thought about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And don’t start thinking about it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>She said defensively.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Interesting. They’ve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems they’re avoiding some harsh realities themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>That is the word on the street, dear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, relax. We’re happy to have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you actually pay for that haircut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, she’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. I appreciate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you talking about? We’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Beverley (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, this is a special circumstance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Do you agree with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now that you point it out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We do seem to keep finding room mates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now you’re taking her side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That’s for your parade of room mates to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I texted you, but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not on my watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And if my heart stops, just let me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll say it again. India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I just stay in the garage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t do that. We’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Come on, I’ll get you some sheets. Then I’ll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is that bothering you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. I just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It’s not a good influence.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Me, either. I’m in a bedroom and you’re on a couch. I’m actually winning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone’s nice. It’s comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don’t think so.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I want to say aw, but I’m gonna say ew.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I’m not kidding. You could see my heart beating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, great, it’ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you know Raj moved out last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we go bring him back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, so we’ll ask him to come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t you want to get dressed first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Amy, quick, lock the door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I just never want to be a burden on my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Me, either. Don’t want to be a burden. Hey, is that the baby? I’ll go check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I also upset Sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>More reasons for you to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Halley’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And she’s having the time of her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then it’s settled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, that’s no way to talk about your baby.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yup, we’re killin’ it.</content></utterance>
