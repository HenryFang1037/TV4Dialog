<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s talk about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We all do. Now, how about dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard (seeing Penny’s door open and the girls inside)</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Permission granted, Commander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why, you guys going somewhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I mean just you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You mean, like a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not like a date, a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, o-okay. Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just a sec.  Too much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When did you and Leonard break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, about two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why do you think he asked you out again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s not dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If he were dying, would you sleep with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, he is not dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you know? Are you a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>With a dead man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, how do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want to know my opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, boy, do I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where on earth did you get that from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t make it true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Because she’s great in everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that sounds right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Polly, tell me about yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. Can they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You are so funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa. Not so fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what did I say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How would you say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have feelings for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s not. Always made it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re overthinking this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, you are. You always overthink things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s got to be doing this on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard (as Leonard enters)</speaker><content>Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I guess it didn’t go well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room)</speaker><content>How about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You were in the middle of an erection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does she want from me now?  What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do not overthink this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, but earlier it seemed like…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You hung in there, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, there was a lot at stake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what do you want to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, it’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? What are you afraid of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if I dump you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So we don’t tell people we’re back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we don’t really have to pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe you kept this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was using the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, so was I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I didn’t see you in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The, the gas station across the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In your pyjamas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Without shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On a cold winter’s night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want beef jerky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m a very vengeful person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>With access to weaponised smallpox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just making a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unbelievable. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The hell do you think you’re going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s because you overthink everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon’s voice</speaker><content>Leonard, are you listening to me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why, you guys going somewhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I mean just you and me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, have you thought this through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, and I think we should go anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where are you guys going to eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny (turning, heavily pregnant)</speaker><content>Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
