<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How much time do we have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anything yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, how about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, Real Sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Dune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, it’s not the same without him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny (voice off)</speaker><content>Sheldon help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come in! Hurry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shall I come back at a better time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tubs are slippery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. I slipped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re holding umbrellas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The ducks in my tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, can you drive me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I can’t drive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No one’s saying that. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh I don’t know, 50, 55.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, they gave me homemade cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, what are we waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cookie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmmm, not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>One was already in an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously? Those shorts with that top?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No… No… Oh, that’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We should have you checked for a concussion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But don’t look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t want you to see me naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They always look. It never ends well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that my arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t feel like an arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then, maybe you should let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All righty.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stars are pretty, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, when do the meteors get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, how’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Better. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stars are pretty, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have your learner’s permit, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Didn’t work out well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, can we please go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where is the passenger side mirror?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Could you please drive a little faster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. The light has been on since I bought the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not soup, it’s courage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. That was the last pudding cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No! What about Slim Jims?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The only thing in here are blue ice packs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, god, I am so hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I dislocated my shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. And how did the accident occur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You ready know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kidney disease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Migraines?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Getting one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you currently pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Change migraine to yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When was your last menstrual period?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, next question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Episodes of sub psychotic rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. That’s much better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so hungry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What kind of score are we looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, everyone grab flashlights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Quick, get forks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I feel like we’re forgetting something important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too. But what? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard and Raj together</speaker><content>Yes! Yes!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over.
