<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, as it turns out, it’s also a Klingon word.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you pay your cable bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America’s Next Top Model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re gorgeous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, look, the’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is qochbe’ spelled with a  or a ?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. That’s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>House? What house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They all live in a house together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A house, where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you’re telling me that I’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, the food’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is my hamburger medium well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dill slices, not sweet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Individual relish packets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Onion rings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Extra breading?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did they say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you protest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vociferously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then what took you so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, guys, what’d I miss? What’d I miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Giselle’s hanging by a thread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good, I hate her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then you’re not invited to our wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Put it on the agenda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s one onion ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just put it back before he comes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no,  no, I don’t think that’s where it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who touched my…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Penny! Penny did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Look, I didn’t know, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A sports metaphor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, baseball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, yeah, I’ll play along. What was my first strike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-65"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-66"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, I touched one onion ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-67"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-68"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-69"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-70"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-71"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One of us, one of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-72"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what a thrill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-73"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re sitting in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-74"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-75"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, she’s in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-76"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-77"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-78"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, that’s it. Strike three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-79"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, strike three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When we find it, you want to go with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Party with the pretty girls, dude!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And a large number of people will believe it never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don’t like your attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, no, there’s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Well, that’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, actually, technically, you did do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s strike one, Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go ahead, eat it. I dare you</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s it. There’s the house, I found America’s top models!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can recognize people on Google Earth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny (entering, angry)</speaker><content>Okay, where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here. Try and go online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Problem with the WiFi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, just try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon (on screen)</speaker><content>Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I reiterate, knuckle under.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There, see? Problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Voila!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon (voice from Howards laptop)</speaker><content>Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks a lot, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Time to do your laundry, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you implying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under, my ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny (Knock, knock, knock)</speaker><content>Sheldon  Sheldon  Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where are my clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, where are my clothes?</content></utterance>

Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?</content></utterance>
