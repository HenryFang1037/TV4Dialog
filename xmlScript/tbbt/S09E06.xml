<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’ve got terrible news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, well, that kind of stinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perform the experiment immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you won’t need much for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hell no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He could’ve softened the blow.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’d have to go to every Party City in California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where does he work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How does he get the helium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many questions are too many questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe he’s not for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Four questions. There answer’s four.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I thought so, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can you show us that dating app?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. So how many girls have you met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, so how does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>First time it happens I will let you know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The man restocking the cereal shelves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s right. And what did he do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s like it was yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you want liquid helium or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was she helping him with his research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. So, are we doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, but where does he get the helium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, but this is violating university code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t you just made of sugar.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not sure how I feel about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And he’s sad about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you guys up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What was wrong with that guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I want to try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That must be him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Great. You got the cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, uh, right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What ya doing, Skippy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hmm, I don’t follow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Is that a threat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Afraid so, Skippy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>No, I don’t like this. I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Really? What’s the hypothesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s the money. Can we do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know he won’t be looking at other girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you, Amy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, it’s Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You may want to leave the room.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right this way, Uncle Harvey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you stop with that already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying not to attract attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s just start the experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not getting caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, did you see this sticker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s probably USC or UCLA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ma’am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have that same underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Chug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, you’re getting a text.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it, it’s not like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And I’d love to take you out again”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, it’s like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you for coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>But you ain’t getting your money back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He wants more money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>That’s exactly how much it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Finally, something breaks our way.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>A few people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? I thought we were all… never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And how many guys have you gone out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Please be less than two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It scared me straight, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, Barry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>But you have to add my name to your paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s preposterous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you give us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me neither, but what other choice do we have?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I promise this is the last time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Helium Man</speaker><content>They should’ve used among, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Helium Man</speaker><content>All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Helium Man</speaker><content>I am open to change.</content></utterance>
