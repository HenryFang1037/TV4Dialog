<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hit it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj (singing)</speaker><content>What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Fun with flags, fun with flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Fun with flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who haven’t learned their place yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, she’s just been lying to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, right. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Anyway, how about dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks, but you don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re awful quiet, everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You heard him, guys, don’t ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh my God, that’s who you look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And how single are you right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eating cake on the toilet single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s khoo-vakh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, he’s over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, there he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um, it was a drywall problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wet wall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Or damp wall, just as bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The woman at the wall store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let it go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you going to confront Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I’m going blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Food’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did, still a mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you speaking English?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could you lie to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Tha… That is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, did you notice your key chain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where’s Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Everybody stop it with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re up, blabby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-55"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you saying you’d like to live with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m open to the possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-57"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ubamy bube cubool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-58"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-59"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-60"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s a great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-61"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-62"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That would be amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-63"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-64"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But you won’t be living here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But that’s my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-66"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But you won’t be living here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-67"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But that’s my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-68"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-69"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-70"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But that’s my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-71"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>But you won’t be living here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you for understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. It, it could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hate your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry, you brought it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not a child, don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that’s soothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you really mean that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah? What are you keeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That candle and you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about my robot poster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can it be more of an internal struggle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How about if I just don’t breathe at all?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We turned your room into a sex dungeon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Over my assless chaps you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you like living with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you know what you need to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I understand. I’ll leave you be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, you’re familiar with the reference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that means so much. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
