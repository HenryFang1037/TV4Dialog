<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m thinking about growing a goatee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You mean a moo-stache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Moo-stache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Say what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Moo-stache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Moo-stache.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Guys, you’re being childish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ll get ’em next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. How did it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here, you can have your seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you want the long answer or the short answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, how come we never get that option?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Translation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Waah. I don’t want a table.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you really gonna sit here all day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nary an argument? Nary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Magic wand TV remote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did Bernadette think it was cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that’s the last time I play with that.  I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. What did you tell them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told them I’d be honoured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I’m gonna miss you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, this one looks nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s afraid the original owners will come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? This one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That one? Damn right I like that one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. Can I at least shower first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow. Well, what did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re absolutely right. Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, when can we get rid of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, that is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s not what I’m saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fancy sounds like a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She told you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we should call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy?  Amy?  Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is hideous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bermadette</speaker><content>Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you’ll talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Since when am I the buzzkill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you think this is cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I think it’s stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re right, it’s great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Which you also figured out by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which I also figured out by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m glad you’re still together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Which is stronger than ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t need to explain yourself to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t need to explain myself to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Keep the table. We don’t use that space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Damn it, I got cocky.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe you should have a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Mike Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Mike R</speaker><content>You’re great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Mike Massimino (on skype)</speaker><content>Can I say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Mike M</speaker><content>Hey, Fruit Loops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Massimino? Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Mike M</speaker><content>Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Mike M</speaker><content>The stuff you have is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t think I did a good job up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Mike M</speaker><content>You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Mike R</speaker><content>Like a woman. Great analogy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on. That was just me joking around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Mike R</speaker><content>You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Mike M</speaker><content>That was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi, Ma. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that, because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Go, go, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s fun up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So why are you trying to ruin it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Now I feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look at Amy down there. Should we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Rajesh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean tings like moo-stache?</content></utterance>
