<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Dr. Brian Greene</speaker><content>My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there’s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Greene</speaker><content>You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ba-dum-bump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forgive my language, but poppycock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Greene</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Greene</speaker><content>Yes, in part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Greene</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shooting at a target?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>An arrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going to do that, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too.  That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? How could you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She was attempting to engage me in gossip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what’s the gossip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, don’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>– Priya, can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>What, what did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>That’s madness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You’ll need to explain the game to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Well, regardless, I’ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She’s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? You’re kidding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, that’s hard to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What’s that piece of tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey! How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, then who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In confidence!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali (on webcam)</speaker><content>We’re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can’t complain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s fine. But if I’m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren’t you making your sister comfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>Please tell me you’re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that’s not a bad way to go. He’s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don’t drink a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>For now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’ll tell you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is something going on with him and Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>Who’s Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Doesn’t sound Jewish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>You can’t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Okay, we’re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Thank you, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Well you should have kept your mouth shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you listening to this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lucky bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a Bernadette thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Good or devastating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m gonna ask her to marry me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Marry you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’d wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No rush, no rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Man, he’s going to be blindsided.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. It’ll be awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you smiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, Raj, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you learned anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>By all means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m familiar with everything, but go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I should think so. That’s gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too. Good times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This was nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I know that. How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My sister told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Shut your ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hope you’re hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will Amy be joining us for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I believe so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, good. Everything okay between you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. That’s not what he meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy (on webcam)</speaker><content>Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is moving faster than we thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pun intended?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Happy accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Pun intended?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What pun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, God. What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, let me just stop you right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, I will marry you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Congratulations!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, it’s so exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wonder what changed her mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>As good an explanation as any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re pregnant?</content></utterance>
