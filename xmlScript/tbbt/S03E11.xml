<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard (singing Deck the Halls)</speaker><content>Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Merry Newton-mas, everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>When were you going to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why were you keeping this a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I just, I thought…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You are, it’s just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. And those specials, they change every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what did she say when you told her we were going out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No trouble at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes, dear. Mommy’s proud. I’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I don’t really like flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>It is, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I heard that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes, but we are on the subject, so I’m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, Mom. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Mmm, menopausal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now I’m less fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>She’s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You must be very happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why? I’m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not the time, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>It’s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard’s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, really. I have a girlfriend now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>And where is she this evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I see. Her grandmother died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you’re hurting your partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard (to Raj who has whispered to him)</speaker><content>Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hi. Sorry I’m late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I’m divorcing yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes. He was cheating on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it sounded like a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When did this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Mmm, well, let’s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard’s father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>September 22nd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, yes, that’s right. The weekend after Leonard’s dog died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mitzy’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who’s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>So, Penny, what’s new in your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. Not a damn thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you do not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Your check engine light is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Eight years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nothing. I’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yikes. What’s so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>That’s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I do, I’ll teach you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I made tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then why are you telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a conversation starter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a lousy conversation starter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want that too. Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s very comforting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not the comforting part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, I do feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re my surrogate family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yikes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, that is fascinating. I’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Bev, guess what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sleeping with your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Really? Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The one from whom I live across the hall from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, that’s convenient. How did his penis turn out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy’s penis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Really? Well, that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, let’s go find out who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You go get a taxi. I’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Sonny boy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, not bad, not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you guys drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Is it because she’s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?</content></utterance>
