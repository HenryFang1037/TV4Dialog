<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No one wants to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Easy. Sleeping with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Tricking Penny into getting engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think someone owes me an apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You admit Amy’s a distraction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, maybe we have lost our focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then we’ll go to a hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A hotel? Did you see The Shining?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you see The Lake House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You would go to a beach house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Want to go to Vegas this weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hell, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. I’ll check flights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll check hotels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They seem okay with it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>For your information, Emily is working tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thinking caps on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. I never saw that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Is that a no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I, I think I still have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm, that was mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Robot prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Also mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it vibrates. Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, let’s just come up with something new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I have an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I have the same one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We got to watch Back to the Future II.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll make the popcorn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, where should we go first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But they play Barry Manilow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But they’re called Fairly Manilow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What if we don’t want to vomit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you start in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leoanard</speaker><content>This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Had will have placed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s my boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait. Is brought right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Marty and Doc never had have had brought?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. You did it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think it worked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think after this, I’ll be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re embarrassing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go online and look it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like behavior modification?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That cannot be true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, it was match point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If only we had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll check Amazon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Housekeeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It was us the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why’d you tell her? It was working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Was it working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys look like you’re having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re having the best time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s a dollar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you believe this nerd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string like a baby kangaroo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna chase her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>To the walk-in closet? Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ow. We didn’t vote!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. And now I owe you one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ow. That was your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Negative reinforcement is really wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No way. Not Bill Murray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Bill Murray (on screen)</speaker><content>I’m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Have you ever seen a body so fine?</content></utterance>
