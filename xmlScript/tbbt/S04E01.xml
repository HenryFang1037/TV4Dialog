<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And now the kung pao chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And finally, my moo shu pork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whoo-hoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And it only took 28 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Impressive, but we must be cautious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No one ever does. That’s why it happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ask me to pass the soy sauce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, does that come up much on the space station?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Pass the soy sauce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Coming up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So how’s work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we all are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?  Peace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, not peace. Hang on.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You kidding? They still think it’s in a secure locker at JPL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You stole it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon (phone gives text alert)</speaker><content>Excuse me. Oh. Amy’s at the dry cleaners, and she’s made a very amusing pun. “I don’t care for perchloroethylene, and I don’t like glycol ether.” Get it? She doesn’t like glycol ether. Sounds like either.  L-O-L.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>His girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon has a girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How long has this been going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Or, as we call them, Shamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny (squeals)</speaker><content>Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, what do you communicate about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin)</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I have a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why on Earth would we have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still digging the Shamy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t date Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great. Have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. You have to drive me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I don’t drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, go ask Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard said cockamamie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine. When’s the date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hurry. We’re going to be late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, no, not per se, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let me get my cockamamie keys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that’s the spot. Oh, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, dinner’s ready!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll eat later. I’m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for driving me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then, this is my first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fair point.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Where does he poop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what’s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what?  You’re not going to believe this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But the light indicates…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you a homosexual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, how ’bout some music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. It was hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Any follow up, Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was just trying something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Muggles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You slipped and fell into a robot hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penis first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. Now, help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not funny, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no! Don’t touch, the program is paused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then let’s un-pause it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about an acetylene torch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then what do you want us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s great, Mom, thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t come up here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have any ideas, Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s an amusing factoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is this true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few. . What’s </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Where did you get 171 men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. 16?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>14.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then 128.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, come on. Almost there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t tug. No tugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Next time, take your own advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, could you help us out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>My, my, my. What do we have here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I slipped and fell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a robot arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Where’s the rest of the robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I only built the arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>‘Cause that’s all you needed, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can you please just help me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm.   I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man’s penis out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think you could be a little more discreet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>I’m sorry, we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, it’s what controls the arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But it’s frozen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Did you try turning it off and back on again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you see, it’s more complicated than that.  No, wait!  Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did not have sex with 31 guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re still on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I’m gonna tell your mother on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Curses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If I’d thought of that in the first place, I could’ve saved myself this whole night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, Howard, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve decided not to procreate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?</content></utterance>
