<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s fine. I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rajj</speaker><content>It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like you and your dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t rule out the dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, it bothers me. You happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How is this helpful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We brought snacks for movie night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, You guys are the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s with the clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What kind of teenager did you think I was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Slutty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The word is popular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How was your prom? Did you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, but I was on clean-up crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, that’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My date would’ve had to clean that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You went to seven proms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, where’s Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you go to your prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Shldon</speaker><content>…of AP Calculus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, thanks a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That sounds like a yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I saw a picture of you two dancing together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Stewie, your bath is getting cold!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I got to go, bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You knocked more than usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just one question. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are post-prom mating rituals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There, perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Was that a flask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, you look amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, so do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you look so handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s a neat tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw, that movie’s so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you like her because you both have red hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I like Cinderella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, she’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s Jeanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s Jeanie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Who’s Jeanie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the girls really did a nice job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, who’d you go with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you wouldn’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was before my growth spurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, that already happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think that’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re making me worry. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sceme</speaker><content>The limo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rajj</speaker><content>Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, my mother’s okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Jeannie</speaker><content>Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Jeannie</speaker><content>Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is so messed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I know, I’m having the best time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Jeannie</speaker><content>It was a long time ago, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And you’re only second cousins, who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, you knew and you brought her anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you for wearing your heels.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I really did think you looked pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. So much so that I started to panic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.</content></utterance>
