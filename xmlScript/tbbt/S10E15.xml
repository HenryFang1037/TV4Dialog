<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nicely done, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Those are just the things I say out loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please stop talking about poodles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, go for a little walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just keep walking.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Go ahead, open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Where were we?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whoa. Just trying to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is there anything we can do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no. I will take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sounds really nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that’s the one to beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, you’re home early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow. He finally used it. What’d you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m really happy for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. I really give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I pee now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Four thousand dollars, worth every penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Colonel Williams. Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>Just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>Don’t do that. What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>Oh. I want this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>Yeah, I want this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Col Williams</speaker><content>You both make excellent points, and thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. You guys ready to get crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, the bra under here ain’t beige.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Don’t worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart’s on the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Under the careful supervision of her godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>My apologies. I didn’t mean to offend you, Don Corleone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like I said, you ladies have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Call if there’s any problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. She’s busy. You call Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Call me. Don’t call Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I would never call Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, instead of arguing all night, let’s just split up the baby chores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, great. Um, I’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, but if he yells It’s alive, we run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’d you even get that up the stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Well, so I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Open a window. It’s about to get smug in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s worried about looking foolish. That’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nothing says fun like being scolded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette (phone rings)</speaker><content>Oh, it’s Raj. Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hang up, we don’t need help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It says Tuesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How is that a T?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You’re wasting perfectly good milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, you drink it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s just milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, don’t you drink my milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hmm. So we just throw this away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, I don’t take it black.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s classified. If we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven’t pitched anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just keep thinking. I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You really figured it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you’re a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Wait. She’s settling down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe we should just call it a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You sure? They’re open till dos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re all dressed up. Why go home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m just not really in the mood anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s going on with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not sad. I mean, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, maybe I’m the one who’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you sad about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re upset I had a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What feelings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I’m constantly worried, I’m always tired, and in a few minutes I’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on. You’ve got so much to feel good about. You’ve got a great job now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You make more than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s bigger than mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I can’t help it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s gonna make me cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And there they go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ew.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a manifold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I guess it’s fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just look at the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, what should we have done differently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Told ya. Can you fix it for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a turbo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.</content></utterance>
