<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve never seen him this happy before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He thinks there’s a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Trust me, I, I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, okay, I get it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, she’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, what prescription are you getting filled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I wasn’t going to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I’m busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re going to girls’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know they’re making jewellery right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not his testosterone levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Goody. What’s it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper does not cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s true, you’d rust.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is it really worth getting upset about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny, how’s it going over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello, everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m making a bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m just making a mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>When did I have pistachios?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Arthur.  Arthur.  Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, did I wake you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>She sounds like a keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I should be so lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, uh, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You’re annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that really hurt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why is it odd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bill Nye</speaker><content>Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>That’s what I told my lawyers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>He said I’d be speaking to a class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>What are you guys working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Oh, that’s interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow, Penny, good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s going on with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I didn’t know you were coming again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny (laughing)</speaker><content>It was not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, what tools did you bring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, that looks like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, who’s up first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>What, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Can, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Why do you put up with Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, you ask really hard questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You, you know you’re describing a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Yeah, they, they hate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Why, why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Another photo from Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>He probably stole his wallet, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s amazing,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa, where is that coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Since when can’t you open up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Buddy, I was just joking around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. It wasn’t easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Arthur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m surprised to see you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll get Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. It would be an honour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh. Uh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>And, what did you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Mmm. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I invite you in for tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Arthur. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You didn’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh gets better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry, they’re both married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
