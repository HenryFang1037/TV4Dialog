<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s what you’re thinking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, one of the things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are any of them me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, sure, I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whenever you’re ready.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I don’t want to rush you, but I’m closing a little early tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh. Hot date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don’t have to not ask me twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh. Is this freaking you out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right. Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Raj, you don’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Too late. No returns.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was really intense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Been there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm. So what do you need help with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And that made her angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One more time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like, a random person or somebody she knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How are you saying that with a straight face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys are being jerks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks for cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm. My pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That carrot was delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Still haven’t heard from her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Too slow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re gonna set a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. If you say so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m focusing on my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we’ve been busy with our paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you eat all my yoghurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know which yoghurt I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should have done it months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right. Tonight’s the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, I like when you take charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, why haven’t we picked a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not in a rush, busy with work…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Things are good right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You still want to get married, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you want a date, pick a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is your dad paying for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, two friends each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, I want it in a church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. I want black-tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. I want to release butterflies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seriously? Airborne worms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sounds perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You still didn’t pick a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Stay out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Mmm. It’s a beautiful night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You aren’t scared, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m not a whiner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I’m free tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you saying you want to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Vegas isn’t that far away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m in. Let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now get out of my spot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Never should have told you my middle name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t let that sway you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think we should talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you’ve been living here a while now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>His middle name is David. Go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Are you breaking up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You need to take that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Howard and Bernadette (singing)</speaker><content>Happy birthday to you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doesn’t sound very romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. This is crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. You think people are gonna be mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is. It is about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. No surprises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And no regrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, um, well, there was this girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing really. It was just kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope, never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you telling me this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would you rather I didn’t tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, keep your mouth off other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, we’re still getting married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because we love each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-49"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And it’s the happiest day of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-51"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ha-ha, don’t push it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Strongly disagree. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I hope you understand.</content></utterance>
