<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good lord!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Lock and load.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, blow up the gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stay in formation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, you’ve got one on your tail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oooh, he’s got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, he’s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard look out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dammit man, we’re dying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Goodbye, peasants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The bastard teleported.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You betrayed us for money, who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am the Swordmaster!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wooh, I’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds like your neighbour’s home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right, right right right right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard (exiting to hallway)</speaker><content>Penny, the mailman did it again, he…  Oh! Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>What’s up bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not much. Bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is, is everything okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mailman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, thank you, again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny for your thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s the matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m a romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because he looked better than you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, you guys work in the same lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I’m… a bit of a self-taught expert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, then you’re probably okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello Lesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Hi Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Goggles, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Hang on. I’m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o’ noodles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Wait, are you asking me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>What sort of experiment would you propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Well, why don’t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean, kiss you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you define the parameters of the kiss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>What do you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>None?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah. Well, thank you for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>None at all?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You might be bound by them right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I smell robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The internet’s been down for half an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also, Sheldon may be a robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how did it go with Lesley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You could power down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Class instructor</speaker><content>Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard (to Leonard)</speaker><content>I think Mrs Tishman’s got her eye on you. I’ve been there, you’re in for a treat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard (singing)</speaker><content>You don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… God, that’s a good song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, listen to me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don’t buy a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>Ah, hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Supper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, six thirty’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Us guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all’s coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Did we say a time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Six thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And that’s still good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cos it’s not carved in stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, six thirty’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll get my chisel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Could you be more specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Six thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it too much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not if you’re a rugby team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You could have stopped at “it could go well.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I could of, I would of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is the sex starting now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m having a panic attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, okay, well then, calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What should I tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give me the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I thought you wanted to cancel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would she be expecting me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what’s new in the world of physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice and funny, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Waitress</speaker><content>Can I get you started with some drinks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No,  You were saying, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’d like a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, you know, it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just, it’s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, chafing, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Emotionally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Physics. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, centrifugal force!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.  Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you’d be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but I get car sick too, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry about your car, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Was this supposed to be a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I was just checking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night.</content></utterance>
