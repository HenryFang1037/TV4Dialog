<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is shaking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Please don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, this wasn’t the awkward part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, all right. S’u’up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, feeling the awkward now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>To you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The statement stands for itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, aren’t you sweet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I could think about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, whatever works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, peace out!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this is very pleasant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I stand corrected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>That’s very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. What’s your favourite fruit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Ih-uh, strawberries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? That’s where I was born!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>You’re kidding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Why, what-what-what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What landing party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my god, what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon (arriving)</speaker><content>I have a bone to pick with you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oo-oo-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What invitation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, clearly I could have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>No, no, we have seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not the right seats. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>What is he doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Does he always do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, just sit here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, this is it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) </speaker><content>Leonard   Leonard   Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon (showing him laptop)</speaker><content>Tell me what you see here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stephanie Barnett is single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Give me one good reason why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because this is not Star Trek</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) </speaker><content>Penny   Penny   Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is banana bread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is a door knob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, would you like to come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you be sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s having problems with Stephanie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We never got to the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You told me you were going to have the talk with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>During which she defected to North Korea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And a three hour dinner with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) </speaker><content>Penny   Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) </speaker><content>Penny. Zucchini bread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hi Stephanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Want some more wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m helping you with Stephanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>By making constipated moose sounds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, for god’s sakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Do you want some help with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh my god, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like a gladiator!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stitches? With a needle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Watery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She stuck a needle into my hand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Hey, how’s my big cry baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, are you still going to spend the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard (after Sheldon tuts)</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, can you open this for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I see your stitches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Leonard, congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? no. no, that’s not right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.</content></utterance>
