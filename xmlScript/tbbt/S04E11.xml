<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Infinite Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Check it out, all about planets this month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s an atom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Agree to disagree. That’s what I love about science, there’s no one right answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you and Zack again, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Were we here earlier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, we should, we should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it’ll just come back to life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>No, I’m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They might be smarter than some people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A dolphin might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I’m stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What the hell did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny (Opens door again)</speaker><content>You laughed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So go apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You started it, we just piled on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What would I even say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A Milk Dud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re embarrassing yourself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>No, you weren’t. You were making fun of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s very hurtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t know, it still wasn’t very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Milk Dud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we’re cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon (to Raj)</speaker><content>Junior Mints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You guys want to come in and have a beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard’s buying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Really? I haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Literally? Literally a million years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You want to go with ’em?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Okay, see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Are you mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Milk Dud?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, no, you’re thinking old-school Archie. It’s much more sophisticated now. Like, there’s two universes, and Archie’s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>About time, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Wow, lucky you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Is that sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The Archies are over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Yippee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So are you guys coming to my New Year’s Eve costume party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high-heeled boots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He is the only person we know with actual muscles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t replace me with Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why not? Penny did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I’m Green Lantern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can be Aquaman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m still mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Well, you won’t be when you hear the great news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What great news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>We’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year’s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, what about your friend Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re jogging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is how the Flash paces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Look up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. I forget the rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Let’s get this thing over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Come on. We’re trying to win a contest here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Penny, there’s no I in Justice League.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t. He’s making our case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Babe, open up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not talking to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Then who are you talking to? Babe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand why you’re upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Wait, wait, does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good-bye, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stupid Aquaman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Whoa. You dated Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She didn’t tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who else would it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I may have failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t want to go without Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, I call Kermit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What makes you think I can convince her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go away, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Go away, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not going to that party, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not the wig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look. We’re not really me and him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You make a cute Green Arrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Green Lantern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like there’s a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. Let’s go to the party.  How do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard (outside the door)</speaker><content>Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Aw, damn.</content></utterance>
