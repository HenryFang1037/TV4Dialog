<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The math is all there. It’s not real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Were you drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think you’re the one who fell over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That would explain why the sky was also on its side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, it’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, you went to a chapel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We had one of those silly fake weddings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you know those are real, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, they’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, they’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They’re real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But it didn’t seem real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you brought beer for everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, the medicine’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach.  Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>How can one little toe hurt so bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a better idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, well, that’s a great idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No traffic, we’re sailing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, Miss Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So how do I undo this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, well, what do I have to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hah!Penny? Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Want of understanding? What does that even mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks for saving the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t be silly, he loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, he cares about you a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Happy Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here. Thank you for having us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You need any help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You ever play football?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>A little in college. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we can just put this whole thing behind us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, I need some air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wuh, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Listen to Stretch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>How the hell do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, you invited him here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I’m getting ready to weigh in again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What do you think they ought to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Did someone say blintz?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s why I sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So was my dad. And then he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyone need a beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>So, does your dad still live in Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. He died when I was 14.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Well, you’re having one with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>To your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I never had a beer with my dad, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wonder what she saw in that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Broad shoulders, good hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How’s it going out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re drinking beer and watching football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So why don’t you do that with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They don’t want me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Zack’s here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stir the gravy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I don’t know if I want to sign it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj, Bernadette and Amy</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why won’t you sign it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We don’t have any kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Did somebody say pie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, everything was delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Did someone say pigskin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Well, I’m drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just vomited on a lot of clowns.</content></utterance>
