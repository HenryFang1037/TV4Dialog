<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Star Wars on Blu-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, it’s high-resolution sadness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Do we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like most of my dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach)</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shoo, shoo! Be gone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So movies, yes or no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Movies, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That doesn’t help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I was talking to the bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, just ignore him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The bird’s still there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Quick, what does a hawk sound like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Scree-scree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you think it’s a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are we overthinking this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap)</speaker><content>Too casual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You pick plenty of movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate those movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. No woman would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m pushing play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I really don’t get your problem with birds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hummingbirds are pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That is one tough birdie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>To get sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, I’d like an order of fries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her)</speaker><content>Oh, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What you writing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>It’s a working title.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I’m Kevin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>I’ll let you get back to your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So have you written anything I might have seen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay.  That’s a pretty big blue jay.  One, two, three.  Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay!  Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment!  No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny (to Kevin)</speaker><content>So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Kevin</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What am I doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, he’s not that cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m serious. I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re in a group. I’m scared.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, he’s a sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Sorry I ditched you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, he had to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>This must be Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I totally get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Huh? I’m sorry, get what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. I want to know what you told her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s kind of between me and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Laura.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Laura.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Laura.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A… S… Take me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe I’m not done hanging out with…  You’re right, it’s getting late.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Way off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh. Maybe I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. </content></utterance>
