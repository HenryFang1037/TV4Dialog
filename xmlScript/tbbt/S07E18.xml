<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I wouldn’t be so sure about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Have you heard from Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I did. His talk at NASA went great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon didn’t heckle him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, how is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Disgusting. Do not tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you guys want to do tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stuart? Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, I don’t feel so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Calling 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean it’s too late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s been murdered by someone in this room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s Bloom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What do you think I was gonna do at home?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That kind of actress. This sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Any question but that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you care? You’re dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for my bobble head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, what happens next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I didn’t know you were fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s it for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>From the future? How fun and imaginative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m gonna need another clue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, give me the flowers and pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You ready to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, did she see you in the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then don’t say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, don’t do it on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, can I go to the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, just try not to look too alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s my jam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So I guess you two are making it work long distance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What does your card say, Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you don’t go into science for the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dun, dun, dun. He started it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, aren’t you gonna come with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Mother?  Mother?  Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I saw you having naked sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who was he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How long have you been involved with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>A few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>That is no way to speak to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Or I will send you to your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Go to your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I occupy the moral high ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Go to your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I’m a professional scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Mrs</speaker><content>Go to your room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a grown man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we please get back to the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I think you and Leonard will be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t know she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And the healing begins.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then why are you doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>That is very Christian of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>How old do you think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Are you having the sex talk with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, someone has to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It actually was kind of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re just saying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I liked the time travel element.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. I thought it was inspired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was. By Terminator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Definitely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Putting it in my phone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And it’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yup, we’re all in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.</content></utterance>
