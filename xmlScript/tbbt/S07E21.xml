<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I could use your assistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is just so frustrating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What can we do that’s different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What can we do that’s free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, got it. We order a pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Bernadette’s working late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy’s sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw. What’s wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What ails her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Who knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No problem. How’s your mom feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was thinking we could watch a DVD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, so, you’ll watch it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re a good friend. I owe you one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard. Help me get out of the tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not that one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell? What? She’s not working late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And Amy doesn’t look sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why would they lie to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a good question.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But none of that means we don’t love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I also love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s fusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’d probably give you homework.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you lie to Howard about tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you don’t feel guilty about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How is that not good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you ever paid for a meal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not with money. Read.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, try again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.  Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I think I see our next stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know, it’s weird, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. We should do it more often.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content> Ah, it’s Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is she still mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because she has sex with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I just did. What was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, oh, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>Does she have dark hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>Does she work in a similar field to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Psychic</speaker><content>Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I wonder that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then, why do you watch these things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Can I tell you something without you judging me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>They kind of turn me on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And play.</content></utterance>
