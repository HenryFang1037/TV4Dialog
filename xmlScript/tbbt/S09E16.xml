<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We? What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know, it’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know, Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, bud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ready to play when you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s so amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why oh, no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re the other baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess we’ll call this a draw.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny (reading text)</speaker><content>Leonard says you’re pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is so exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s all real exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are, are you not happy about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, he could bring the baby here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This isn’t a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wasn’t joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you know what we should do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, we should go out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know, a bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can’t drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We can, but all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Doctor said I can’t have sushi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no reason you can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is that a new invention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, it’s in the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They have that. It’s called Uber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. I’ve never thought about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You may have actually just come up with something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I kind of already do that for Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I’m embarrassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds juicy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How could you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do know what that’s like. I really do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not finding anything either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a good sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, wait, I found something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you focus on what we’re talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d enjoy that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nah, she’s a good kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m telling you, you got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys can go in if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then why are we drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Would you like to sing karaoke with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How is that a drunk text?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj (rapping)</speaker><content>Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard (singing)</speaker><content>You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just bust a move,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just bust a move,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi. How are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you gonna get up there later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny (singing)</speaker><content>Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy (singing)</speaker><content>We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?</content></utterance>
