<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thank you very much. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everything is stupid and I want to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How much money did he win?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Over half a million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here he comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Be polite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know how to behave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, congratulations Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, aren’t you a peach.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who listens to the radio any more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to read a geology paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I found him in an old box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why would you buy it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t buy it. I made it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Last question. What is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, it’s in poor taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Remote-control Hawking</speaker><content>Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>His eyes also light up in the dark.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sounds like the night we had coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I, I knew the answer. I got excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I’m trying to help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have no problem calling him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine, then do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s this button do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Remote-control Hawking</speaker><content>Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I laughed because the guy was Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I admire you, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How did you deal with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let it fly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, and what happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I do, your life is fine you big baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you think this is in poor taste?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does it spin around and do tricks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, we’re done. It’s offensive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re in a good mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think he might be learning on his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then the robot uprising has begun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I didn’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t imagine you being violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What about me and Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You liked my short hair, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously, none of you liked it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think he looks cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I think you’re cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think you’re both cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think I hate all of you nerds.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry I’m moving slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t take this any more.  Bert.  Bert.  Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Is it working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? This isn’t gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe you punched Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Stephen Hawking (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.</content></utterance>
