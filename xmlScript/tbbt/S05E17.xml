<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was a nice retirement party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can’t be very long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm, indeed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So sad.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing here, Kripke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You just called dibs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Rothman (entering, naked)</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Professor Rothman.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got you a little something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do I like it? Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>Can’t this wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. We just need a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Siebert</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kripke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re in my spot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That is big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And ugly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So ugly. What am I gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, it’s got to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What will you tell Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s numbered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, limited edition. Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon (knock on door)</speaker><content>Oh, that’ll be Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s he doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>We’re not fwiends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>What the fwig is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>How does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Almost got it. One more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Sports.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Five what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Balls in the basket. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon (dodging out of the way)</speaker><content>Ew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>It’s out, wight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Time. Wan out of woom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey! He did that on purpose,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I’m gonna need more force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken.  Do I get points for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Oh, you are going down, Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon was higher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, what a great movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night, real Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good night, real Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good night, transvestite Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy (entering)</speaker><content>You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s right over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have no idea. That is weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You hate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I feel like an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Amy, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Call first. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rothman</speaker><content>Oh. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rothman</speaker><content>I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I came to say I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t bother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Amy, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, come on…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Grab your hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Damage is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have such a good heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Huh, I try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what about Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why is there a hole here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it? Listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What, you don’t like wind chimes?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The bird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Little higher on the right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Little more. No. That’s got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll let you in on a little secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, good call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re talking about the painting, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang in there. I’ll be right back. </content></utterance>
