<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Cosmonaut (in Russian)</speaker><content>Launch step twelve acknowledged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Mike Massimino</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The uterus quivers, does it not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Give me those damn Pringles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cosmonaut (in Russian)</speaker><content>Are all of the systems of the ship ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Mission Control</speaker><content>Da.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But I’m leaving in two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>What about Apple Jacks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t need to take cereal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s so great. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That wasn’t going to be our processional music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it was going to be mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, what do you say, Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I wear my maid of honour dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, you look great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where’d you get a beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You proposed to Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Where did he pop the question? What did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She said no, can we drop it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It wasn’t a real proposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why wasn’t it a real proposal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He asked her during coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good move telling Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Registrar</speaker><content>Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Registrar</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You know you’re going to wind up walking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cosmonaut</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, isn’t that kind of tacky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are any of them still married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s got to be some place special we could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you shut up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I know how to make it special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, wait to go, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about our roof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great, well, who’s it going to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you see in her?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Dimitri (in Russian)</speaker><content>Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leaking? What’s leaking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Fuel. Shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Mission Control (in Russian)</speaker><content>Not bad. We feel okay to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Dimitri (in Russian)</speaker><content>Okay, thanks Mission Control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What happens on the tenth time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s the groom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Why can’t she drive herself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>All right, just hurry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not now, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here you go? What am I, a football?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Like that guy could catch a football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Louder!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, grow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I didn’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, that’s enough from the both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he started it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I believe you two have prepared vows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Speak up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.</content></utterance>
