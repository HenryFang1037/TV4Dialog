<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi, how was the screening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How’d it go with my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, we’re gonna get married again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just said why, we don’t like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is your brother out of prison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d love it if my dad could come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So there’s no maid of honour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t see how I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then I graciously accept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who’s going to officiate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I was kind of hoping you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who’s Erno Rubik?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>How dare you invite your father without consulting me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, and there’s no excuse for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. It’s working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right. You realize what this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is there a window around here we don’t know about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mary Cooper</speaker><content>Thank you for picking me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I was speaking to your young lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Oh, please call me Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t be silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, actually, I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It sure was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, I take care of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Oh, Beverly. How nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’ve met her, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Yes, I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>So, Mary, how have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>My ex-husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Don’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whew, chilly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I can see my breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>We can hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you find this funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we have to use the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Alfred Hofstadter</speaker><content>When are they gonna fix your elevator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t, any day now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>How the hell did you do that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t this nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, we’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alfred. Thank you for coming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dad, you remember Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr. Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>How do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And his girlfriend, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>A pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And, of course, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Hello, my hateful shrew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Of course. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, look at that, you can apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>You know, the Bible says forgiveness…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sorry. That’s true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you done with this nonsense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I also love the enemies of America.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mom, please save something for the toast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Play with your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that Howard in front of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, maybe. Get closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re being ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so follow him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, go faster. You’re losing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is his hurry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, I think he wants us to pull over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>No, just focused on work and the church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Ah. And what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I work at the church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Well, they’re lucky to have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Well, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you realize what’s happening here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What took you guys so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what did we miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Leonard, your father is just charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>He’s also broke. Did he mention that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, Mom, you sit over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d be lost without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, that’s funny because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Back to your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Why don’t you take a pill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Like you did before sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>What I really needed was a blindfold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>All right, everyone, calm down. Let’s all remember what it says in the Bible: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>When God writes one, I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Would you like to share a cab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>That would be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Where are you staying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m at the Westin.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I think that you could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is happening there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s still not answering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My father’s not texting me back.</content></utterance>
