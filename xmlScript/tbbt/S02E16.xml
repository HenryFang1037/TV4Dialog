<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, still funny, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But what about the creek bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t I run away and you cover me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Howard, I’m on your team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, Leslie, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Where’s the rest of your squad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Dead, all of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It kind of does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I say we make every moment count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I agree. How exactly do we do that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard (voice)</speaker><content>Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>War is hell.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, more cutbacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what baffles me, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What was all that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about it, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You and Leslie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In the paintball shed! Twice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Calm down. We’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you planning on sitting here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m going to the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then what difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t sit in his spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.   Happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not unhappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Satisfactory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, most people don’t get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Howard, I’m home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m busy, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t come in, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>He’s got company!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, there’s the arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Is she Jewish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you Jewish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You think he’ll notice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why do we have to tell him I did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on.  There, butt print.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s too small and too perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny (as Sheldon enters)</speaker><content>Shh! Act normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon! How was the comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Koothrappali picked me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, friends forgive the little things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you dare, missy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wackadoodle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here.  Get up.  There. Problem solved.  Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If it were your head, it would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard (after his phone rings)</speaker><content>Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>His right hand is calling him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>You’re improving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, all right. I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When did that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>About 12 seconds ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Actually, I’m trying not to say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you crouching there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny (arriving with cushion)</speaker><content>Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From that key maker, I highly doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sit on the damn couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
