If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Agreed, what’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn’t be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think this is the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Fill these out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank-you. We’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Oh, take your time. I’ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I don’t think I can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sure she’ll still love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the protocol for leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s try just walking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bye-bye</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you still mad about the sperm bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that why they sent you to boarding school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that was the result of my work with lasers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>New neighbour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Evidently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Significant improvement over the old neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leonard, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Well, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we have invited her for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We already watched the Season Two DVDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not with commentary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the beauty of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To what end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi. Again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what do you guys do for fun around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, today we tried masturbating for money.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, make yourself at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, thankyou.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re very welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually that’s my work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is really impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Holy smokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t invent them, they’re there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In what universe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In all of them, that is the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, do you guys mind if I start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, Penny, that’s where I sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, sit next to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I sit there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you want me to move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just sit somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, sit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aaah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes I now, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I resent you saying we don’t have company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is an antisocial implication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I said I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, Klingon boggle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Participate in the what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So it’s based on your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m from Omaha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-59"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-60"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-61"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well it sounds wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-62"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-63"><speaker>Sheldon (mouths)</speaker><content>What’s happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-64"><speaker>Leonard (mouths back)</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-65"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-66"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It took you four years to get through High School?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-67"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-68"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-69"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-70"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You? No, you’ll only make it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-71"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-72"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-73"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-74"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-75"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Our shower works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-76"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-77"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-78"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-79"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-80"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-81"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-82"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s right down the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-83"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. You guys are really sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-84"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well this is an interesting development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-85"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-86"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-87"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-88"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-89"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-90"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-91"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-92"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-93"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-94"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-95"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-96"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but not of the same species.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-97"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-98"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-99"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-100"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-101"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-102"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait till you see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-103"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-104"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-105"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-106"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-107"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-108"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great, you guys have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-109"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-110"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-111"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard has a lady over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-112"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-113"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-114"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, there really is a lady here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-115"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-116"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-117"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not anticipating coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-118"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So she’s available for coitus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-119"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please stop saying coitus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-120"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Technically that would be coitus interruptus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-121"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-122"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-123"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-124"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-125"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bon douche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-126"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-127"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-128"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Save it for your blog, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-129"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See-ka-tong-guay-jow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The hair products are Sheldon’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay if you say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll probably say yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Must we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think with your penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No I don’t. And neither do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So we get to have a scene with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny (to Raj)</speaker><content>So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard (pushes buzzer)</speaker><content>I’ll do the talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Voice from buzzer</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Get lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, thanks for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not going to give up just like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies. What’s your plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you think their combined IQ is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just grab the door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is it.  I’ll do the talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Enormous man</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From the intercom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>How the hell did you get in the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. We’re scientists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell him about our IQ.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mom bought me those pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re going to have to call her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well you got me out of my pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, cool tiger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, sounds interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you’ll think about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it was a valid hypothesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Our babies will be smart and beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not to mention imaginary.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is Thai food okay with you Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re both curry based cuisines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Any ideas Raj? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Howard (sings)</speaker><content>Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.</content></utterance>
