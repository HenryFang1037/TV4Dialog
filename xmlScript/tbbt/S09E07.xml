<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why is he writing to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Hey, high five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey. You got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Pause the game, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We need to talk about redecorating this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no, not this again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>May I say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Never mind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon (answering door)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I told you. This guy is gold.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Whatcha doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That is reasonable. But what room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How ’bout this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then how ’bout the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I want to change my answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. Then the dining room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How long have you known Adam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>A few years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And what are you getting him back for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Let’s start with your name and occupation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>What was it about Spock that appealed to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My brother was mean to me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you probably had it coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Do you have any Spock collectibles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Can we see the napkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When did we get a wall safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When there was no more room in the floor safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When did we get a floor safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When we got the security camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a security camera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, your father-in-law is in there right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>What’s so great about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I did what I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Your dad’s on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When is your visa up?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you like to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have a will?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will Wil want it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Wil won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what’s that ring box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You bought her a ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. It just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon (shouting)</speaker><content>I said I’m fine!  We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Did you find that helpful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I knew I could smell ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>What about from when you were a kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>Did it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Adam</speaker><content>That must have been very upsetting for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh pfft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You did go pfft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, you’re yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>This documentary is gonna be awesome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>You gonna be okay down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a rat skull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Yeah. I think that’s the den.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bernadette (above)</speaker><content>Earthquake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aftershock.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy. How you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Definitely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you know what that means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you telling the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nirsh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He didn’t meant that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That would be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But you were okay throwing me under the bus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Mr Rostenkowski</speaker><content>This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s an actual I’ll think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I really believe I’d be a great dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?</content></utterance>
