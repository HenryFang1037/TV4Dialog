<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. How does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>The time is 6:37 p.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Cool.  Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t sound like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Here are some images of naked grandma butts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’re having everyone over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Otherwise we’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But we can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, poor us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Howard, what about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy (on skype)</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No one can go with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t think that will be awkward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See you then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And there goes my list.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So, how does this work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you ever do anything for anyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I happen to be a giving and generous lover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Soup Kitchen Manager</speaker><content>Uh, can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi. We’d like to volunteer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Soup Kitchen Manager</speaker><content>Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Are you and I close enough for me to say…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Soup Kitchen Manager</speaker><content>I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, great. We’d love to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wipe that smug smile off your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I feel so grown up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, you are grown up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep. What’s the code?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just the four digits, month and day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t know my birthday, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>May.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>May what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you don’t know everything about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi. Ready for the aquarium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If that makes you more comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I might go visit my aunt next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, the one in Bakersfield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Soup Kitchen Manager</speaker><content>We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What difference does it make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are we done discussing the weather?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Well, what should we talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Man, I walked right into that one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Justin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice try. NSYNC forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Interesting. I never told you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? I didn’t know you had a journal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it doesn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, this reminds me of high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You worked in a restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Emly</speaker><content>Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Soup Kitchen Manager</speaker><content>I need three people out front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Right here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No fair, I was meditating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How can reading my journal be an accident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Let’s just finish cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, really, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Does it really say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would I lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just a few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that regular or honey nut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I mixed them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just one. Are you doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good. I want you to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. You got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Y, you’re Elon Musk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wh, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. I made my wife come down, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>You think you might ever get back out to space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Elon</speaker><content>Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s just play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But you can pal around with a hagfish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I miss this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess sometimes I’m silly.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Be right there. Hi, lover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you have a nice time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I thought we were just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We are. But I was hoping, maybe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Sure.</content></utterance>
