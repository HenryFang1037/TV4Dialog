<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t get through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, get over here and help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, one second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying to shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s it, we’re dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, challenge them again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doing it right now. Oh, they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Kids are always better at video games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, so our love is not real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess I just need to face it, I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hot dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>To denial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Zack. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>What are the odds of running into you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>That’s what my dermatologist said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, on, on getting engaged, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how’s Leonard? Is he still smart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he’s not even here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Cool, I’ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re gonna have to be more specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the hands of those teenagers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>More.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy teenagers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now, this is rare. I don’t know which one of you I want to stop talking first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like J-Lo’s hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, it is neck and neck right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be fine, let’s just go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aaargh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, she couldn’t make it. She had an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I didn’t ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What smells so good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj is teaching me to make croissants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is this part of your super-aging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Damn it, he’s good at that, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I miss that guy. He’s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don’t know what he’s saying, but he’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>So, Penny, what’s going on with you? How’s the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, it’s okay, I’m still in pharmaceutical sales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, if you’re not happy there, I’ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don’t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you’ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a nice offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You know, we’d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can’t do this without Me N U.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, ’cause it spells menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Yeah, right? It’s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that’s my favourite.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I think I got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is it I’m going to die alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You work with Sheldon, you tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hurt myself juggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where did you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you tried letting go of the rope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, well, have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, I need help getting down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, what do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you told her she was being dumb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We covered this, I’m dumb.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I would never let Howard work with an ex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, you wouldn’t trust him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I wouldn’t trust her. He’s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause he’s scared of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Terrified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what? I’m with Leonard, this isn’t cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you think it’s okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m returning this stuff to Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You said juggling was dumb, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you calling me a quitter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if you honestly…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This conversation is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I’ll find a way to deal with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t need to do that, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I made you tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry I called you a quitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you reading?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So I’m running out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, I thought you were sweet on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So many warnings.</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, are you sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Zack (on phone)</speaker><content>Penny, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, uh, so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, bad news. When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so there’s no job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not if I want to be doing this later.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I went to see your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Seriously, where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just told you, your mom’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. What’d she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot.  Hi, Bernadette, remember me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. And the little lady has a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Tammy Jo St. Cloud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry, you’re not a dork.  You’re a clown.  Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad.  Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years.  Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s enough, put her away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>Bernadette (as Doll)</speaker><content>Oh, big daddy, I don’t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, you’re freaking me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>Bernadette (as Doll)</speaker><content>Don’t be that way. If you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh.</content></utterance>
