<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard (looking at an orange notice on the noticeboard)</speaker><content>Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe she’s his lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well she’s free to examine my briefs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, I’m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Well, that should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for coming by.  Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late, I’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you be late, I wasn’t expecting you at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM!  Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>It’s nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You too, swell, also.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, how do you two know each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>It’s because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I think you’re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and… I’m sorry what was your name again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rajesh.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>My friend’s getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad’s estate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>I guess that’s why they call you a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard and Howard together</speaker><content>Woah, woah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think so. Shelly doesn’t like company. Even as a little boy he’d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No we don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Shelly, she’s family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And don’t ever call me Shelly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll walk you to your car. You’re in structure 3 level C, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What just happened?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>So anyway, we’re eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hee-hee, just classic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there’s a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny (knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.)</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Those are not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, they have your little name label in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you don’t look that much alike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I get a hallelujah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hallelujah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj (running in)</speaker><content>Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, good for you, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Well, there’s Dr Patel at our church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You still have to wear a helmet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>The sex book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny (to Leonard)</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute, I w….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wasn’t staring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t say you were, I just said she was cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I brought snacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Oh my! Gherkins and….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Onion dip, it’s onion dip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t entertain much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You’re welcome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Missy, I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>God yes. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Bye guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bye Missy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye Missy, see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Goodbye Leonard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you two have to back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why should I back off, you back off dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what, you’ve already got Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I can have Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hell, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, look at me, I don’t have a foreskin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s fascinating, but I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great, but I….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever. You have to do something about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because she’s your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who are you to decide that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re out too, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Say what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard (to Raj, who is smiling)</speaker><content>What are you so happy about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We all make mistakes, let’s move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj (waving finger at him)</speaker><content>I think you’re focussing entirely too much on the drugs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Missy (who has just entered)</speaker><content>Oh really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard (to Penny who is standing next to him grinning)</speaker><content>We all make mistakes, let’s move on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Okay. I’m not even going to ask why you’re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>What on earth are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>And what do you mean, mediocre stock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Sheldon 2.0?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>You have got to be kidding me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God’s special little people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have an alternate proposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Missy</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, we have to settle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t start with me dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to go again? Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And he’s down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, come on, get up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I weep for humanity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny (answering)</speaker><content>Ah, hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
