<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we ready on the stereo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go for stereo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>All (calming down, embarrassed)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s a little loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No problem, turning it down.  San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax  et voila.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they’re really cheap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Public access enabled. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Boy, that’s brilliant, but I’ll see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, hang on, hang on.  See!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s a question, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>All together</speaker><content>Because we can. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They found the remote controlled cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, wait, wait, what’s on top of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wireless webcams, wave hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You may want to put on slacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who’s running the red Corvette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That would be me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m with you. I just have to make sure if I’m a synthetic human I’d still be Jewish. I promised my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. I read it before I threw it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget the parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Forget the parties? What a nerd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t. I’m the lead author.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t need proving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re not supposed to, but they should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I forbid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You forbid it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you admit that it’s our work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, once again, I’m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh no he dit’nt!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how’s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They don’t, that’s why I saved this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, let’s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is this all stuff you want me to try on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. What’s this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here, why don’t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, where you going, just put them on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, are you shy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m not shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I won’t look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, put the pants on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Putting them on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, why didn’t you wear it at Halloween?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, I don’t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The… the eighth grade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My last growth spurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yup.  I said no, put it down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon (unlocking his mailbox)</speaker><content>Hello Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get anything good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t. . It was a joke.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I’m here all week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh dear God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Little misunderstanding, huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well how do you feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well I’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait… what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I couldn’t poop this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You should just talk to him, I’m sure you guys can work this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s certainly preferable to my plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Which was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A powerful laxative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, little idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn’t really understand it but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course you didn’t, he said little idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what words then, exactly</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You had a lucky hunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard (coming out of apartment)</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t you ever speak to me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What… .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, he… .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m leaving for the conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then why did you say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Were you trying to impress Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no not at all. A little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How’d that work out for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Leonard, ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Libido 1, truth zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bye Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, this side does look better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, I didn’t say better, I said less stained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, then good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard it before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s roll. Hey, nice suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a classic, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I really should have brought my own car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Thank you.  Are there any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Yeah. What the hell was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Any other questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)</speaker><content>Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.  Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You are not Isaac Newton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You cannot possibly be that arrogant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You continue to underestimate me, my good man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, so why did you come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I knew you’d screw this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t screw it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you admit that you’re an egotist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, that is it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You cannot blow up my head with your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard (knocking his hands down)</speaker><content>Stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You were trying to blow up my head.</content></utterance>
