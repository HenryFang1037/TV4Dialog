<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we’re calling…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>Wondering how it all began?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj (singing)</speaker><content>You’ll need a good attention span.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>For information and entertainment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj (singing)</speaker><content>That’s equally effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Together (singing)</speaker><content>It’s fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. That’s just where we have dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Could have played that on my harp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I honestly don’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wait. I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and do you remember what you said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Please find someone who cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying.  Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It’s Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And what does that have to do with flags?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bert, you’re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Her name’s Rebecca.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don’t need food as long as I can look at my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t like when you imitate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I said that to you in confidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is supposed to be our family fun day. What’s so important on your phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m on the day care’s website.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop looking at that. The day care’s great. It’s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There’s nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What if she likes the people who work there more than us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She already likes soap bubbles more than us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When I go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. We don’t know anything about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re highly-trained educators with background checks. They’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You leave her with me, and I’m not any of those things.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where’s Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He took the day off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don’t know where I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So Howard back Monday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Want to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, quick, sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I guess I just love love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’m very happy for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. We don’t know anything about this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>What do you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is she a geologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh great, see you at seven.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Learning anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. I’m going back to work after only four months, so I’ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Told you we should have gone to Legoland.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, grow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you have any friends he can date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, hey, guys. Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks. Everyone, this is Rebecca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you making?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Finally get Halley down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, eventually. She’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It might be good for her. Howard’s mother was around him all the time, and he’s a world-class mama’s boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Go ahead, have a tantrum, that’ll prove me wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess. It wasn’t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>On that charming note, dinner is served.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Actually, I’m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it. It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Get your food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So how did you two meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Oh, it’s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. The end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I didn’t either, until I revamped my profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’d you do, delete your photo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And don’t you slam that door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Did I say something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s always him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Right. I wasn’t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was wrong. You can come back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn’t really work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>I could give you some free sessions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, is that offer for everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice try. I’m not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Rebecca</speaker><content>Where’s your bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, just down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>She’s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn’t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, that’s so weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we lived happily ever after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The end.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, guess I’m ready to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have a great first day back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You have everything she needs for day care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yep, all in the bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Bye, cutie. I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stop, you’re gonna make me cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, now everybody’s crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>At least Halley’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s ready to laugh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>O-o-o-o-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s actually funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hello. Join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, that’s a big step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think it shows a lot of character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I’m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>How’s she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s great. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See? Nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Love you, too. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>How is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Can’t a guy hang out at a college he doesn’t go to and stare at a baby that isn’t his?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Probably. We should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll get her, you grab her bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hang on, Halley, we’re busting you out of there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hello? Anybody home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that Bert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It’s Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think it’s Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I broke up with Rebecca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. You know, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>No, I miss her. I don’t know why I listened to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re that upset, go get her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I tried. She’s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You called on him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Guess who’s home from day care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid’s foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You realize they called when you took her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Guess who’s home from the aquarium?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Sorry again for barging in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>You guys are nice, but I’m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.</content></utterance>
