<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Almost there. You’re doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I don’t need a treadmill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The doctor says you need to get exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I get plenty of exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. Now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We set it up in Howie’s old room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you know how to set it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Should we do something for her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how were things on the set?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, pretty good, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean a forklift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I would do it for my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I need to tinkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You are a putz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As advertised.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for coming with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that a real thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Emily, Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you here alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean, not really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hey, should we get our seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was awkward, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Please don’t shut me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go away. Just go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I was trying to save your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>You can’t give up. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Let’s just move on. No one cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m her boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Isn’t she too hot for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Well, boyfriend, get off my set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can’t do that. He’s with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Wow, that fell apart really fast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t have to make me anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry, I left them in my turban.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But you don’t have sex with her, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Slick, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you had intercourse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’m hungry again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’m still hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m coming, you big baby.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey. I just lost a job for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft.  I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God, what am I doing with my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You having second thoughts about acting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You were on set, you saw what it was like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was over a bowling alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but there was ample parking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you were so good in the TV commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was for haemorrhoid cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>An interesting question. Well, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many women have you had dates with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now do you see the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, I’m back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shh, I just got her to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Thanks for letting me come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. Please, come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, me, neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>That’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. What a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can I get you anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I need to start making some smart decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>With your career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>With my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. We could get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So I’m like a bran muffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You, you stupid Pop-Tart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Then I guess I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You guess you’re in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Leonard: Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So is that it? Are, are we engaged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it kind of does, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I know. This might help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where did you get a ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.</content></utterance>
