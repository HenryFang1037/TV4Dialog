<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You couldn’t sleep either?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please, tell me how I can fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, I think he’s onto something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m currently single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s true. You are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard (waking up)</speaker><content>U-u-u-uh!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy (on skype)</speaker><content>Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, hello to you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m hanging up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. See you in about half an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because we’re broken up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you knew about this this whole time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you didn’t think to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just give me the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. My old scarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We made one heck of a team, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whose bra is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s Penny’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hands off. I’m mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What will pay for itself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess that’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Call you back. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can we talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I would love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wake up, wake up, wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bring Penny to meet Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, you actually want to meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. And that’s coming from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, you want to meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s because you made him more confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I never thought about it like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, me neither, not until just now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>250 dollars an hour. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I’m just hearing about this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t have to, you should want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, great, there’s Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why are marine biologists always so cute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are we done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now we are done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, do you mind if I sit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, what we did, when we were drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we just made out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Is that really the reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What else would it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Okay, well, that’s something to think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-43"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-45"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>Imagine that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>Mandy</speaker><content>And your wife is worried about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-48"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on screen)</speaker><content>And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you said you had something to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That sounds nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?</content></utterance>
