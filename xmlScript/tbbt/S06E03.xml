<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I got to get back to work. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really, you’re serious? Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, baby, you’re killing me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>M-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that’s my potty training journal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, your potty training journal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, disgusting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why do you need all this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s basically what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you want help, just hire a grad student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe I could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You said it, not me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>No, thanks. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>I don’t do drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>No, of course not. How did you know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   I trust you paid off those parking tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>Yes, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hearing unimpaired, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You talk to Howard lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.   Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and…   che-ee-ee-ese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Smooth. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I have people for that now. You’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ms Jenson</speaker><content>I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>It’s nice to meet you. I’m so excited to be working with Dr…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I should probably get to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She seems nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I said was she seems nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I love her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, no, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, hello. Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d like to speak to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. Well, tell him Amy called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>All right, I will tell him you called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm, that’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe he didn’t notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you do not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s her I have to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, really? Look at this face  How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  Aha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can we go now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Here’s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This should be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Rainbow, not chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two cherries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>One on top, one on the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stems removed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Um, top one, yes. I didn’t check the one on the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I’m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Given her what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Please join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Is that true? Is he all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’ve been around scientists all my life. My dad’s an astronomer at SETI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>So, what kind of research are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>High-energy lasers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Ooh. Military?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)</speaker><content>You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Sheldon (choking)</speaker><content>Cherry stem! Cherry stem!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look at you, putting on a brave face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So it does bother you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how was work today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh! You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, Raj had to go to the nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, is that it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon (arriving with Alex)</speaker><content>Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.</content></utterance>
