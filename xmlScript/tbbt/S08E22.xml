<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice. Where were you when I was single?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nope. It’s pretty exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How would I be blinded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll take my chances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Why do I own one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>With a beautiful girl on your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How’d you get ready so fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why did you need a belt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So it’s not really like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, can we get on another airline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, that’s it? We’re not going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. You could tell it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, but I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe we should recalibrate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It actually says at least?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You see where I’m going with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Not much, just wanted to see how my son’s doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Very well, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Are you still dating that dermatologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you’re where that bill goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>I’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It’s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>I’m cutting you off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No red and yellow, no red and yellow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Won’t that void the warranty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, where’d you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I got you a little something to cheer you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because you are giving your commencement speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what they all do, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, can you get it working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t freaking believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Relax, it’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello, Mummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Mrs Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Mrs Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Mrs Koothrapalli</speaker><content>What does that mean, active social life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Mrs Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Mrs Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Well, however much money your father was giving you, I’ll give you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s taking so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think this is gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Well, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Done and done.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One toy at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s the first one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong. Obesity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I have the tool you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t you just call tech support?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I call tech support all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ha-ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You call tech support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What a baby.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Headmaster</speaker><content>And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard (on screen)</speaker><content>Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re graduating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>GPS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Battery charged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Four hours of our lives gone? Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. All systems go. In five…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Four, three, two, one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what my train used to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ready to call tech support?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>What did you say to your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>You think you take after me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard (on screen)</speaker><content>It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll, I’ll tell you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.</content></utterance>
