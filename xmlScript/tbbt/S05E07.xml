<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ghostly voice</speaker><content>Sheldon, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm.  All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ghostly voice</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You should’ve seen your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s probably right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who had money on faints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I had pee his pants.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Droll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is she doing in a comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Hot girl</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um… it-it-it…  Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Hot girl (to Leonard)</speaker><content>Are you getting this Next Men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Hot girl</speaker><content>I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Hot girl</speaker><content>Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Hot girl</speaker><content>Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You are very cute, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Alice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be sure to check the mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Open the mail!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on.  You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>What are you wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Wow, you must have gotten so laid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Want to see a comic I draw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. You have your own book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>You’d think, but no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can have my car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon (creeps into office carrying a box)</speaker><content>Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj (entering)</speaker><content>Good morning, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have a thing of paper clips right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be a lamb and check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right.  Who do we have here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Want some mac and cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Lactose. Gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Sulfites. Migraines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we used to go out, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you’re okay talking about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re sure it’s not weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you guys do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. We just made out a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s not who I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, then break it off with the new girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now we’re getting somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What does your gut tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done.  Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Science. You wouldn’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought you were leaving the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. I’m having a moral crisis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That actually does help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Screw it, I’m going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. Tropicana, no pulp.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? That’s very unsettling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whatever.  My… oh… it’s… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard has a heart condition! You know that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no! I can’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hurry! We’re running out of time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, God! One, two, three!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Trick or treat, bubbeleh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>But?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But I kind of have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Are you kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I don’t believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, I don’t, which part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, not so good. We have to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, relax. It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, kind of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.</content></utterance>
