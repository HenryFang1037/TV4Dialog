<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We still on for tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Since when do you read social science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I go to the bathroom like everybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys kiss and hold hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happens if she doesn’t like us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But he’s going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Long story short, they have seven HBOs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Emily, you know almost everybody here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And this is Leonard, this is Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice to finally meet you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I told you she exists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Um, okay, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did she say she didn’t like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We have led different lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just this vibe I got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I hope you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For starters, they shed and bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s kind of a dream come true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That does sound fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not that bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Oh, why would he say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Did it not happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Did you kiss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Were you naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So, it was a hook-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Toy stores, puppet shows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We are now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You told Emily we hooked up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We were having a conversation about past lovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. You’re crazy about me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Almost everyone has a past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And I’m sure you can turn it around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How? You can’t force someone to like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, that won’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re right. Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shh. Amy’s here now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You say things like that all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sure she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you stay out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If only Penny had said that once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s something I wanted to run past you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you asking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But you didn’t hear what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s to help reopen the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, hear me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It just seems like a risky investment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Howie, I had no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t like to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like your honest opinion on something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then I think it’s a terrific idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. Wait till you hear about our van.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks for inviting us over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thank you for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. No need to apologise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, what brings you by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m always welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Mm, just try and call first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target, buying me shirts.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m so glad we could work this all out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we would love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good night, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right, night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Emily and Penny (simultaneously)</speaker><content>I hate her.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I was looking forward to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>With comfy seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And snacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I guess it was too good to be true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
