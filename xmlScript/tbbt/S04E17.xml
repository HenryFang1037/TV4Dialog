<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just come with me to Raj’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want to go to a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How come it’s not a party when we do it here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because we don’t throw parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess you’re right. See you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So don’t watch TV. Read a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it about me or the dead pixels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hey, you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just sit here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where are all your friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, the horror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amy (on phone)</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, bestie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cluck-cluck-cluck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun person I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So needy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m setting out snacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re having people over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Possibly. I Tweeted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We had a good run, you and I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But change is a part of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It certainly is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good-bye, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course I’ll be back. I live here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um. Hi. I’m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I’m currently living in. And I guess what I’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… uh… could you come back to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Barry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>One more question…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, you must be present to win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Okay, I’m ready. I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… oh, crap, why is this so hard?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yo, P-dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I kind of figured that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There’s no one around, so naturally, I’m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Weally? That’s your question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Surprisingly, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I’d like something to think about in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The water level rose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Does yours have wet bweasts in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>So, long story short, I nailed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When he finished, he shouted Eureka!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don’t know why. Just do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Great, I’ll make a beer run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And I’ll take a shower. We’ll meet back here in fifteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m unhappy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, God, you’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hear, hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Why is it called a toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon tells it better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He kind of does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, hell, I miss him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, where do you guys want to go dancing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We were hoping you’d know a place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But you could if you wanted to, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>More or less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s that like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I would take that deal all day long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You should get one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, God, that is so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Leonard’s really one of a kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s kind of creepy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are there beans in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you want some or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.</content></utterance>
