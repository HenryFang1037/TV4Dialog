<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what package are you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why would we want that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re not into this, we can do it another time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, have you gotten married yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Don’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy has ended our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Amy broke up with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is Penny crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not really. Can you come over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, don’t be like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why did I just hear Amy’s name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s on the phone with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy’s upset? Is it about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I think it’s because we’re eloping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When last we spoke, you said you needed time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it’s only been 11 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re not back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And who’s this guy you’re taking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There’s no guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What if they call our names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, and the fairy tale continues.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you for doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Our pleasure. You feeling okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. What was her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>Where are the rose petals?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Female Voice</speaker><content>We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, we’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup, just want to get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>Great. I’ll see you two up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Female Voice</speaker><content>Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Didn’t even crack the top ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I said I needed time to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sure you guys will figure something out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You hear that? Raj is devastated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not taking sides.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>At least you got picked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. You wrote vows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Official</speaker><content>Is that the song from Toy Story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He loves that movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw, that was beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, we totally won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will someone take me home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nicely done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the night is still young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right. Just forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you feel guilty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, she had dental insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you feel guilty after kissing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean, every time you see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You still see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You work with her? How could you not tell me that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly! How’s my baby doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She broke up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, Shelly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You want to tell me what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Good chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then no, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Everything’s gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You’ve got so much to offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Any man would be lucky to have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I just hope I did the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Like you’re doing right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not glowing. I’m upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. That’s so sweet of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does? Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Some girl named Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mandy Chao?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Well, I think I’ll be going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Howard (on phone)</speaker><content>All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What happened? They just got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Think they’ll break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I figured that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I never imagined it any other way.</content></utterance>
