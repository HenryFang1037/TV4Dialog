<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. No bendy straw, some party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To success without Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So what happens next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>First thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Computer Voice</speaker><content>Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where is everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who else has access to this room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is disconcerting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But the movie did just get good.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sir, I, I, I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Col. Williams</speaker><content>Sounds like you get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Col. Williams</speaker><content>You guys completed phase one, we’ll take it from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where did you move it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Col. Williams</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you implementing phase two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Col. Williams</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Col</speaker><content>Williams: That one I can tell you, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is all very upsetting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Col. Williams</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people’s feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, well, I, yeah, you got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where are you moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And when? But also where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bert has a room for rent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay, that’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, that’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, he’s a grown man, he can take care of himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You really believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Once again, you got me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Third floor, wrong apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s okay, everything’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re kidding. Why would they do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They wouldn’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, what’s going on with you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give us some good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy’s got some news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, um, Raj is moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. When?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m happy about it, but, I mean, it’s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny (on phone)</speaker><content>So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, stop it, he’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess. And he’ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Got to go. Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you feeling okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re so kind. You know, I don’t know how I ever got by without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I thought that, too, but I’ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That is true, I have said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, a lot, it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you’re not telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s wonderful. Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I haven’t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So are you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, but I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are, are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, I like a little brown sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re still gonna go, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what’s wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And yet you bore his child. Neato.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re excited about this opportunity, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, a simple yes will do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know, but what if Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A lot of lectures?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, so you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, wait up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You left something at home. A big hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I found it right next to these kisses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s too late for me. Save yourself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, are you excited to have your own place again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I am, but I’ll miss you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, we’ll miss you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You could try saying that without smiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I got the blues. My baby done left me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re being silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you really care about that last one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but that list was sounding a little thin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So trick her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Raj (outside)</speaker><content>Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it’s gonna be a while.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come here, let’s talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A little clingy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know and I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I signed us up for ballroom dance class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I made us have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Bring it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And now the movie just got rated R.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey. You going somewhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that isn’t necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Does this mean you’re okay with me going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wasn’t thinking that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, it’s just, I’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can’t Skype it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s a risk I’m willing to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, then. Let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What if we don’t fold our clothes at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or, what if we fold them?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, here’s your key back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we would love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy (off)</speaker><content>My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t compete with that. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we give them their privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I want to, but I don’t think I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Whoopee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m good now.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll love you no matter what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And when you’re at the gate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know what they look like, but sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And every morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. That means a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.</content></utterance>
