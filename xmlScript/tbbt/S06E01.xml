<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right now, Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I must admit, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard. Can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can hear you without the phone,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Don’t be snippy. I’m just excited to talk to my baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m excited to talk to you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>So, what’s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about calling her my wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Wives don’t take boys from their mothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They do. That’s why we marry them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I just hope I’m not dead from a broken heart before you get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s hot. You kids better use protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How long does this stay on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know what the anthropic principle is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where do you stand on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Strongly pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m all for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Attaboy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? I can come? Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on webcam)</speaker><content>Howie? Howie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It was. Until I found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. Let’s talk about that for a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You said you told her, but you never did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How clear is the image of me on that screen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Pretty clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do I look like I feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Like he’s been doing since he got here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this place is so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell him yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yoo-hoo! Over here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I invited him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You found a loophole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe I bleached my moustache for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, Amy, I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I hope that’s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is great. What’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go Sports?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is awesome. I love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, I’m glad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, where exactly are we in this relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Absolutely. You’re the girl, I’m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll get it. Go sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello-lo-lo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was, but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we don’t! Come on in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sweet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>A woman who says she’s your mother but sounds like your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’m not going near that fakakta thing. I’ll catch a computer virus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t catch a computer virus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Oh, so now you’re an astronaut and a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you want, Ma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Your wife says you have something important to tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>It’s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I’m just the kind of person people like to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Don’t bother. I’ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I’m no trouble when I die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can’t let a woman tell you what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Oy. I can’t believe these people won the Cold War.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now, can we please change the subject?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Fine. Explain why you’ve been gone so long and I haven’t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I’m growing to like American football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, who’s ready for another beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great. Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, hold on…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some people might say it was romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I really thought she would say it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Every time you drink alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your point being?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dessert is served.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just had cobbler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what? I’m done with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>W-Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t leave. I need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. You’re my ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that was beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Now, I assume we’re splitting the cheque?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, no. It’s okay. Hang out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re my first customer today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. Great.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.</content></utterance>
