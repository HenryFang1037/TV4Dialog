<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, it all comes down to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve got butterflies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>T Minus 45 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>T-minus 30 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I told you I get diaper rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>15 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Five, four, three, two, one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyone in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do not stop refreshing your screens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>All (repeatedly)</speaker><content>Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>All (repeatedly)</speaker><content>Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>To be cool? Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, what number in line are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, fifteen…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>…thousand two hundred and eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sunday’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not Sunday, I love Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe we’re not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? You were all going as the Hulk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And we’re back to the first kind of sad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on phone)</speaker><content>Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t even get to that part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Last week, you spent that on a little dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. You mean like a museum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, like a museum, but anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Does he sound like a criminal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you think I told him to come to your place?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There sure are a lot of little kids here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Should we leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I could go for a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>James Earl Jones</speaker><content>Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>James Earl Jones</speaker><content>Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe this isn’t a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on. We always do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Even Batman breaks the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know I struggle with Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, you in on this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Name one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about that little cup they give you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you impressed by that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>James</speaker><content>You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>James</speaker><content>He was not. How messed up was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So messed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>James</speaker><content>What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, afternoon tea was a bust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Gosh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He just parked. He’s on his way up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. This is exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is. I feel alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe slapped with a fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought you were a badass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>James</speaker><content>It is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>James</speaker><content>They sure did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>James</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I told you it was Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>James</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>James</speaker><content>Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…</content></utterance>
