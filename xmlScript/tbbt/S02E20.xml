<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Thai food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I could go for some goat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We went to the comic book store last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So what are we going to do tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The Wolowitz Coefficient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also a good plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. What does he like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A superb choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s a multiverse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get her out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, I’ll help you pick something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Store clerk</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think we’re fine, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Let me know if you need anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean for someone who’s into comic books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let it go, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why should I let it go? I saw it first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but I saw it from the front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A far less impressive feat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need it for my Robin collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s my comic book!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, we need a ruling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, cut it in half?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hello again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Depends. Do you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yes, that’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You drive a hard bargain, but here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. So, um, just give me a call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Apparently so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you ill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When did you pick up on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gee, thanks a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you rather I offer my personal insight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My original point.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny (coming out of apartment)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what are you kids up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you guys are going together, great…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, see you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See you, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Take me to a bar with women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard (to Raj)</speaker><content>Do you…?  Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, he may not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wrong again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should we talk to some of these women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s your system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>We’re having coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t it a little late for coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll just go look for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I found the decaf!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Barkeep! Alexander me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about those two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about the ones in the corner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think Blinky’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got it, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, so we just go over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What else you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right.</content></utterance>
