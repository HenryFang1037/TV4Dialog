<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Kryptonian mustard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, he’s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Booya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>“Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s David Underhill. So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>David (approaching)</speaker><content>Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I’m David Underhill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, y-yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you’d be able to give me a hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to work with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well, if you have a little time, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Thanks. I’ll call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There are always do-overs when my people play sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, I was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nice motivational speech from the team captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was working with Dave Underhill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard’s got a new BFF.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So? We’re in a rock band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Saturnalia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait! You bought me a present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you do such a thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Howard (to Raj who is whispering in his ear)</speaker><content>I know. It’s funny when it’s not happening to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s happening to us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ow! Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Are you gonna make it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>David</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn’t moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My God, how fast were you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn’t even get it started. Hi. Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, is it okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>David</speaker><content>It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>David</speaker><content>You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I’m a physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ha-ha. No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Why is that so surprising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, actually we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>David</speaker><content>The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we’re working in. We’ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Since always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Leonard, are you okay here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>David</speaker><content>How ’bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Boy, she’ll do, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, if you like that type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>David</speaker><content>So, you and her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, just neighbours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Really. I don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, science is my lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>David</speaker><content>All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?  Did you forget your key?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you before, bears are terrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That presupposes Penny is tense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me, we’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This one. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You put no thought into that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>I don’t understand what you’re talking about and you’re making me a little uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I never said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>David</speaker><content>This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? We’re going to do an experiment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Uh-huh. We’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>David</speaker><content>You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, why not? You can’t do any worse than Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yippee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s very gracious.     Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why couldn’t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you yelling at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He tried to take nude photos of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice save, genius. Eggnog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lactose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Smoother than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Merry Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
