<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)</speaker><content>You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, he worships Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s really nice of you, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hm, it’s no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still going to introduce him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not on your life.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I said I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, to go to Jewish heaven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Jews don’t have heaven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then to avoid Jewish hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you can’t be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get out of my lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about dolphins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Out!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was great. We talked about movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I showed him some card tricks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something got you down there, bunky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, please, I’m begging you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak _ Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s actually 01100111.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me try gansta, hells no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if he doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He will, he’s really smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Walking away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do realize you own his ass right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can make him do anything you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, don’t be too mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wouldn’t mind a glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wasn’t talking to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bring him to his bony knees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, come on back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, yes. What did you decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What kinds of things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should be so lucky.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. What would you like me to do first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a lot of belt buckles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you want me to return it for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, no, mon petit cherie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is not my laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Those are Howard’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s close enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I knew it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I gave you first crack at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, you have to stop now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Sheldon! I need your help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>I’m not sure how to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Now zip me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, that’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give me a compliment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. You have very tiny hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re obviously good at what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, then why are you always ripping on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now will you give my paper to Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry, I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought he might be a little more excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give it a second. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want to thank you for taking time to see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you mean wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>Are you saying I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Hawking</speaker><content>Great, another fainter.</content></utterance>
