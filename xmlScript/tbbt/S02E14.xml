<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The problem appears to be unsolvable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe you could run some computer simulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There are too many variables. It would take forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We could eat after the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s how we missed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I guess we only have one option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yep, I don’t see any way around it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Later, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re right, it was the only option.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you didn’t specify.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is Leonard around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, it occurs to me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you got a lot of money in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t be silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m never silly. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t you need money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is money I’m not using.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But what if you need it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? I mean, are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are they working on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sincerely hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m regretting this already.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ask me why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do I have to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny. How was work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was that sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was that sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was that sarca..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, you appear to have a package here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you guys have an argument?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, really, how much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, which is it, ten or eleven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody!  What was that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. Dinner’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wait, you lent her money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little mood lighting, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fourteen dollars, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what was the plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Was there a plan B?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>TV star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is not the definition of professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, remember Kurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your ex-boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He was drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I would hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did he pay you back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, but he will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, do you know anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leviticus 11:3: “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Outside? I just made cocoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>– Come on. It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, double sixes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, cool, I got a sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I could use some help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not afraid of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Plus, no one stole their pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys suck.  Come on, please? He’s so big.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, there are four of us and one of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I should’ve peed before we left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, Kurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Lenny, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>No. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I remember him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>And she sent you to get it from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>She’ll get it when she gets it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, there you go. Problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Leonard, let’s go</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess, technically, that was my fault.  I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>What happened to your backup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe we should have your head notarized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If anybody cares, I still have to pee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, is Sheldon here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Did he say why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon (sings)</speaker><content>There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.</content></utterance>
