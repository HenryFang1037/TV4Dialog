<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what sense is that a compromise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I think I got it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard (entering, wearing an eye patch)</speaker><content>Hello, boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ahoy, matey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are negs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I want to watch it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Watch whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I saw what you did there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard (answering phone)</speaker><content>Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How can 5 not be worse than 1?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Star Trek V!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, thank God, you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Woman (peering out of door)</speaker><content>Howard, is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So what exactly do you want us to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll call ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No one’s a scientist like Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My mother is so gonna love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then why did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>He said that I could drive a car on Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. So, can I see you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>You’re not gonna see me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh. Cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, there’s got to be other options.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, snap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Snap what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s Plan B?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why wasn’t that Plan A?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Voice from television</speaker><content>REPORTER: A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover’s malfunction. This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars has ended in disappointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank God for Plan B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you’re mistaken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Psst! Psst!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that does sound like me, but no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is there some problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who would ask me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you going to the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then how can I say it convincingly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just say, Leonard went to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Leonard went to  the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? Why don’t I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going out for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, where is he going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard is going to  the office.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So how was work today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m hoping that’s three different guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I wrote some of it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Are you done eating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Oh, good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phone rings. Answering machine</speaker><content>You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phone rings. Answering machine</speaker><content>You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dear God, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Steph (from bedroom door)</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phone rings. Answering machine</speaker><content>You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>New shirts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, who’s the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah, we did have a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, she’s a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that depends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>On what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that friend Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Screw him. You’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does that change things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So why’d you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m nosy. See ya.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t make the rules, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did someone just feel a cold breeze?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard (answering door)</speaker><content>Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content> Is this a bad time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Hello, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He just won’t listen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Lisa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, Howard, look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, call me. It’s Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Voice from TV</speaker><content>The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
