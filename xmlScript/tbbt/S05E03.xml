<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who wants the last dumpling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you all for this high honour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go.  This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée.  Yeah, well, now it means her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay if he wants to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Neither of them are close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not driving him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aren’t you going with Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not really, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you were reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, who told you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, most recently my gynaecologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you stay as long as you’d like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Which side do you come down on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is she moving out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why would she move out? It’s her house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, take me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Take me home now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Movie theatre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmmmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How was your shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really. Is that my yearbook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Rough night, Casey Jones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s in the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, sure. That’d be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>I’ll get it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Could you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>I said I’m getting it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll get it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got it! Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And your mom would be okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See? She’s good with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? For a wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got you this to give to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Put the corsage on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Amy, this is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, dinner went nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Relax, it’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Would you like to dance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not moody. I’m fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have any evidence to support that statement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine, what do you suggest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I’ll lead. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ready for bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>You don’t know that! I just sat down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Ha! The eagle has landed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There we go, last floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, okay. Again, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And again, you’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Want to come in, have a cup of tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good night. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ames, hi. How was the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God, did he make a move on you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like you had a great night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did. How was yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What exactly do you mean by that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To send a message. She is not for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not for you!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good morning, handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Morning, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Your mom and I made you breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Does he like the pancakes?!</content></utterance>
