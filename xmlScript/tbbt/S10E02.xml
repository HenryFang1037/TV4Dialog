<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard (entering)</speaker><content>All right, we got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, what did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound terrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There goes our big payday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do that, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Does that help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, for a while. Then he comes back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You did already know, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. You told me not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why don’t you want anyone to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Would they really do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My cousin does work in a call centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And my cousin’s a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or in German, a Besserwisser.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks. You guys are the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I forgot my coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that really what’s important right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give me a second to call my cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard’s cousin (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Marty</speaker><content>Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And this is my friend, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I saw it. It’s big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Marty</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Marty</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what you said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Marty</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Marty</speaker><content>Howard, why is he yelling at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Marty, let me call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey. What brings you by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. How was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fell asleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m furious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m getting enraged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon’s phone</speaker><content>Aw, nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content/></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Well, I’m a scientist by training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You’re a physicist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Better. I’m an engineer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where did you go to school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>MIT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, hey, me, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know how I feel about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a lot less big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Yes, it’s this much less big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not even sure that’s possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Colonel Williams</speaker><content>Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Four months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I understand how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wish there were some way I could make it better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And a chocolate shake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Does he even like lemon bars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Something happen at the meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you talked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why would that make me feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is it even possible to get this done in two months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love your French toast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We didn’t. Sheldon did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you just let him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.</content></utterance>
