<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m the dumplings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Creepy, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Creepy good or creepy bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I’m not necessarily talking to the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sit over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon (entering, to Penny who is in his spot)</speaker><content>Sit over there. Baby wipe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you have….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard and Howard together</speaker><content>Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll tell you why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard and Howard</speaker><content>O-o-o-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I thought the blowers were more sanitary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard and Howard</speaker><content>Why? Don’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj (entering excitedly)</speaker><content>Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new…  ew-ew-ew</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you don’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s okay, between  him not talking,  him talking and…  him, I’m better off alone, so,  goodbye you poor strange little man </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s so considerate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what’s your news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard and Howard together</speaker><content>Well, wow, that’s incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I’d so do her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’d do the dolphins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a lease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The people from People.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you proud of yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In general, yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard (entering with Howard)</speaker><content>Hi Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Apologise, for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense you’re trying to tell me something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You were a colossal ass-hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, do tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had not considered that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He can feel sadness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, what do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Smile. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh crap, that’s terrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Try less teeth. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Close enough, come on.  Hi Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey guys, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s very nice of you, I would like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Gablehauser (entering)</speaker><content>Hello boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dr Gablehouser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Dr Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dr Gablehauser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Dr Hoffstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr Gablehauser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Dr Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Dr Gablehauser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I’ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Well, we’ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>How about if I put you in Von Gerlick’s old office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Damn, this is hard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard (after he, Sheldon and Howard whisper to each other)</speaker><content>Science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>And this boy’s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a master’s degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>Who doesn’t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President’s dining room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Gablehauser</speaker><content>It’s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can stop smiling now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aaaah!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon (still smiling)</speaker><content>Have we at this point met our social obligations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You just got him this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A lackey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Almost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, gee, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny (bringing another grasshopper)</speaker><content>Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, no I… the… no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can make it, but I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you guys talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Would you like to go with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course I would, I would be honoured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shame on you guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Charlie Sheen (turning round)</speaker><content>Yeah, call me when you’re on the cover.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Raj, look at you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s what you’re wearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny (to Leonard who is just coming up the stairs)</speaker><content>Hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You look very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj and Penny together</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, come on, good night Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It has more food too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, come on, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Raj (leaving, singing)</speaker><content>I’m coming up so you better get this party started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard (entering apartment)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anythingforagreencard.com?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a date, and that’s racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Even though the menu description specifies shredded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brown rice, not white?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What took you so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just sit down and eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to check before you accept the order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-57"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-59"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do the shrimpers feature in your story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-60"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-61"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Lucky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-62"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, Lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-63"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s irony impaired, just move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-64"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-66"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, not a puppy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-67"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-68"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A griffin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-69"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, half eagle, half lion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-70"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And mythological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-71"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-72"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-73"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-74"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to breed a new friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-75"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-76"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-77"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-78"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-79"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-80"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-81"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He should share our love of technology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-82"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And he should know a lot of women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-83"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Look, Rajesh, I understand, you’re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don’t want it for a steady diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>What’s wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.</content></utterance>
