<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry for bringing this over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Believe me, we know what you’re going through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s right. That’s reasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. You tell him, babe.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What time do you and Bernadette head out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve never been to Palm Springs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So then what are you doing here buying comic books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well I’m open to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you say to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think we should see other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You wanna see other people? Go see other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So it’s okay for you to joke around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Honey, how ya feeling?  The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away.  So that’s good news, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette (pff)</speaker><content>The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does it sound sexy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You just heard me throwing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You bet I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re so weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just as challenging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just as challenging as you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s always complaining about people at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Agreed. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That feels great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Lock the door, lock the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should call the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh, I left my phone downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn, so did I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait, I have my iPad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s not helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know I rely on humour in times of stress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that the hot tub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who would use our hot tub?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Should we say something to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I meant like, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why is nothing easy with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re not making me feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. My record was six.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is someone else here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Did they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Answer the question, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Shall we toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You said you got it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, clearly, I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So how’s your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not great. The electricity’s out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So why don’t you get it fixed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I called, and they’re like, pay your bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I’m single now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What? When did that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, he deserves to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So you’re back out on the dating scene now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me. It was mittens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And who got him to try a turkey dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about the girl behind the counter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You are truly wise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not relating. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what happened with your dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You poor thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you do in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re probably right.</content></utterance>
