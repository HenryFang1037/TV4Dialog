<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Here. Breathe into this bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They stole everything, Leonard, everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Are you the roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, what did they get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Into the bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They took my battle ostrich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, not Glenn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Good luck, fellas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Mr. Cooper, there’s nothing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Doctor Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not the kind with access to drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Fine. Dr. Cooper. I’m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn’t have jurisdiction in Pandora.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s all gone. All gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m really sorry, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See if Raj is done with Pilates.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can we trust him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa! Somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just say thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought I just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. See you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh! Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I don’t know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, sadly, I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think you’re on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. That bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, but I can name all the Kardashians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Believe me, it’s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I’ll show you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, what exactly are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Maybe I should just go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Our troll just walked in! I got him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We got him. We’re almost done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how do you guys want to play this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not where it was going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good, because I would hate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re busy, let’s talk tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>No, no, I think it’s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man’s body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And people think I don’t get sarcasm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, well, well. Look who it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because I do that now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t listen to her, she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s no reason to worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The name and the address drip with evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What else do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, quite a bit, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, he does live with his parents. Here’s a Google Earth shot of their house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No one’s getting tortured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I totally had one of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Also, tonight’s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, screw it. I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One moment.  I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (off)</speaker><content>Fanny pack of wolves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Uh-oh, that’s Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Very nice. You lie to my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj (phone rings)</speaker><content>Oh, guess who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cover for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D’s, three O’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (off)</speaker><content>Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s uncanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Beyonce? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins)</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I always prefer the train.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why did you bring that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now I just feel silly holding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I at least kick down the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Voice Inside</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your doom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Todd</speaker><content>I don’t think so. Let me see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Careful. That’s a collectible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Todd</speaker><content>I know. I’ve always wanted one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This one’s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn’t make it work with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. We failed in our noble quest.</content></utterance>
