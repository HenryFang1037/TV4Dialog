<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what was oh, boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great restraint on my part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s nothing wrong with the science here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard (making a change)</speaker><content>Okay, how’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know the feeling.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, do you want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, then don’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, then go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Listen to you. How can I possibly go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How was it resolved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We could play outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We could sit on the left side of the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I could use the bathroom at 8:20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! Woo-hoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>…the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not gonna be the same without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Godspeed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, I don’t like where this is going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To the North Pole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon (voice)</speaker><content>I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You still might get on a magazine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you guys are seriously considering this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you think you can put up with Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content> Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content> Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re all going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>For three months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is he serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, it would help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did she seem upset to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Did she seem upset to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two for two. I’m on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Where are your tools?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon (pointing at his brain)</speaker><content>Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For this I went to MIT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think I swallowed some paint!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Adversity is to be expected. Continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I can’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here, drink slash eat this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj (on his webcam)</speaker><content>But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>I don’t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Don’t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I got you a little going away present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, a blanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wow, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m gonna miss you.  See you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>I told you no. Why don’t you believe me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>‘Cause it doesn’t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn’t one Outback Steakhouse?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want a cookie, Meemaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But Meemaw just made cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s very comforting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a blanket with sleeves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She does have a short attention span.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, I can’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!</content></utterance>
