<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Watch this, it’s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard’s phone</speaker><content>Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard’s phone</speaker><content>Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard’s phone</speaker><content>Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that’s very impressive. And a little racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So? We’ll start now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can split it two, two and two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, what fresh hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard (opening door)</speaker><content>Hey Penny, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No you won’t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. What’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey, how’s California,” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it’s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>8:08.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He really needs to dial it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard (voice off)</speaker><content>Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you’re new in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh good grief.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what, what, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)</speaker><content>Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s the only way we can play teams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ha-ha, there goes your head again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you are on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, so is Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it’s raining you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s been fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or we could just have a life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess for you that’s an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As usual, nice talking to you Raj </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you suppose she meant by that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s an enigma, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s gone, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well she could have said goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Penny (entering again)</speaker><content>Okay, I have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, the couch is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me guess, you have a problem with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where do I begin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hu.. what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-66"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-67"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-68"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-69"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suggest no liquids after 11pm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-70"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-71"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks Leonard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-72"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmmph, wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-73"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-74"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your head goes on the other end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-75"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-76"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-77"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll risk it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-78"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-79"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anything else I should know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-80"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-81"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-82"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-83"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-84"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-85"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, sleep tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-86"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-87"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s still sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, what time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Almost 6:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I slept all day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell is your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard (entering)</speaker><content>Ola, nerd-migos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sorry, I’ll have it cleaned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Y-you used my loofah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can keep that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Christie (voice off)</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In here my lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Christie (entering)</speaker><content>Mmmm, there’s my little engine that could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>Hi, Christie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>Right, you’re Howard’s entourage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>Oh, well, Howard said he’d take me shopping in Beverley Hills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B_B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For one thing you live with your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do not, my mother lives with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon you just can’t dictate…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No more talking, everybody go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>What is that, like a Mexican deli?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so cool. My first Jew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>But you’re still taking me shopping, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anything you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll go pack my stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I see a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, we’ll just order three entrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We could cut it into thirds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Hi fellas. Oh, where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>I come from Sacramento.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>No substitutions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Okay, no reductions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>No eliminations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t order egg rolls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uurgh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>You are nice boys. Tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I’m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about soup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we can always divide soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about the won-tons?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny (answering)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Halo night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t go out, it’s Halo night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, for Penny it’s dancing night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You go dancing every Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Then it’s not dancing night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who are you calling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content> Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Christie (voice)</speaker><content>And this is Christie Van Der Bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>We can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Christie (voice)</speaker><content>You’re not going to put that on your message are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>No, I’m just kidding, I’ll re-record it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Christie (voice from within)</speaker><content>I’m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Ladies, ladies, I’m sure there’s a middle ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Christie and Howard’s Mother together</speaker><content>Shut up Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>You girl’s talk, I’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Christie (voice as Howard emerges through door)</speaker><content>Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Why don’t you stop butting in where you don’t belong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you guys doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Halo night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>He’s not a man, he’s a putz, and don’t you take that tone with me, you gold digger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Christie (voice)</speaker><content>What did you call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>You heard me, and I’ll tell you something else, you’re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you’re around, Howard is out of the will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Christie</speaker><content>: You know what, I got better offers, I’m out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>That’s right, go back to Babylon, you whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Halo night, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought she was the whore of Omaha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shhh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well then start throwing grenades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m all out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny (entering with three other sexy women)</speaker><content>Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We said no tanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are no rules in hell!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Told yah! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought I heard something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, never mind, alright, go.</content></utterance>
