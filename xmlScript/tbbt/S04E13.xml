<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. So you guys ready to order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Probably serving food that was ordered today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m your best friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t you read my blog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think her weekend just opened up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please don’t touch my breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I, I wasn’t going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. I just want to establish boundaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That does seem to be a valid principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t believe there’s any such thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You lied to me?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q_A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Brawny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re bigger than mine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Still right behind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can vouch for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not you, him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Although yours was an eye-opener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Terrific. Are we there yet?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You want to see the keynote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? And miss the keynote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, see, it’s not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard (voice)</speaker><content>Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Thank you, Raj.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you an element in the actinoid series?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you in the lanthanoid series?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I knew she wasn’t lead car material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who elected you Road Trip God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s the Love Car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Should I ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette (singing)</speaker><content>They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Together (singing)</speaker><content>Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Red Leader, I’m really sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard and Bernadette (singing)</speaker><content>I got you, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I missed you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Very tall and powerfully built man</speaker><content>Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Glenn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Great to see you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you here for the conference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Oh. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi. Ow. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>You’re a lucky man. Bernie’s a great gal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. Bernie sure is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Well, I got to run. The panel’s tomorrow morning. It’s called, Remembering Snow: A Look Back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll try to catch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Glenn</speaker><content>Oh, great. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Bernie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. He was one of my professors in college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh! That’s a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Six-seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is something bothering you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. It’s just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You can’t think that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep. Loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m… I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s go with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy (exiting bathroom)</speaker><content>Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Will do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, girl talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I never really thought about it. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Again, I’ve never given it much thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We have time now. Think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny (knock on door)</speaker><content>Oh, good. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can I stay here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Why, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard’s a complete and total ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course, we’re best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, right, right, the blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, can I stay here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Never mind. Can I stay here or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, how do you wanna do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m not getting in bed with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, when you say make the best of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Just like old times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please tell me you’re not having coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We are not having coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Raj?  Raj?  Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Come on in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, are you asleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know it’s kinda weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>True dat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>True dat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right. Still mad at me about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s here.  No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d like to kick your little brown ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I did. You said no Bridget Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny (voice)</speaker><content>We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Penny(voice)</speaker><content>Oh, shut up, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, bestie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Penny(voice)</speaker><content>Yeah, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me ask you something, Bernie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I guess not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to weigh in here. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, why don’t we open it up to Q_A from the audience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Penny (voice)</speaker><content>Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Glenn (voice)</speaker><content>I’m driving back to L.A. tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon (voice)</speaker><content>Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Must be out of range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.</content></utterance>
