<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Since when do you hum songs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You were just humming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever. Can we just get back to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it.  My country, ’tis of thee. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>I’m surprised you have to ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Public nudity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Eh, that just means going barefoot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Dave (voice on phone)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m fine. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>So, to what do I owe the pleasure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Yes, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How ’bout Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We did raise the roof that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, we totally did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Put on some headphones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>No they make my earlobes sweat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, great. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll show you.  Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, you’re really going out with Dave again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. So where’s he taking you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. That’s a big step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What should we write?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well what do you want to write?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. I posted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cool name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, he won’t stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, can we please get back to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, he’s drinking it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who’s Trent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he’s our fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fan of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You want to go down there and meet him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe I should marry Trent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, like she could get Trent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>This is delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When you were married, did your wife cook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, a little silver lining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Had to or got to? Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My fault. I brought him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a trick question, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There goes our shot at him living on the roof.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Let him spot us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why is he looking at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s just go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Trent</speaker><content>Hey, aren’t you the guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, never heard of ’em!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you even like the Beach Boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They have beach right in the name. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s about Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She did soften your life, didn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s an interesting tie clip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy?  Amy?  Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s Sheldon.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Kiss her, you brilliant fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Get back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.</content></utterance>
