<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If only there were a solution to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here come the waterworks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is this, my first day?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sure it’s lovable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m liking my odds here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>“LOL.” Smiley face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>“P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this?  Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Am I a terrible person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. No, it was a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I didn’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’ll get offered something soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you gonna take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Emily, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, I don’t know if you remember me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right, here’s your chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you get the butter, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then get the other one. Pass the butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Included?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Xbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please pass the butter!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, come on. This is serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does your agent think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So it’s a family film.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you again for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, they do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, are you gonna see her again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, like what? Show me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have my blessing. Go for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, Xbox One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>PS4.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Both great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I like the Wii.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks, Grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard and Bernadette (together)</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you mean, yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean, yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Were you seeing other women when we started dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Were you seeing other men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Were you seeing other men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna ask me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, really?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Me, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, beam me up. I love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s what I’m afraid of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds rough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, this was helpful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Were you like this when I married you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard (on phone)</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did he help you make a decision about the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s gonna die alone, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m proud of you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it is. Although.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You were just a little kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How old were you then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s a Zune?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But what if I’m wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’ll try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A quarter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You look, you look really pretty tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Thanks. I love that jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Are you getting back together with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>That’s kind of adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I’m still here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.</content></utterance>
