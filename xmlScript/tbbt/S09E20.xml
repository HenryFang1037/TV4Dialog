<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatcha doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What am I smelling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s not what the forest smells like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, how would I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You may need this more than I do.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Here’s your tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because he’s hitting on you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But I could get her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll see if it’s available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you trying to manipulate me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well done, it worked, we’re going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Raj, give me a bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes and yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And it just got weird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Amy’s downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, one sec.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I bought a baseball cap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can see that. What team did you get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we’ll be in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m ready to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anything you’d like to say to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice hat, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you so mean to me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What the hell are you watching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So he can be part of the experience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s so cute and rustic up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you ever been off the grid before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was afraid he was gonna eat me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Leave it alone. He means well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s just trying to be supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You saw him carrying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Astronauts saw him carrying that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This place is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>On the other hand, safety first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow, it’s really coming down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And there goes our hike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ll wish it would kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So what do we do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They have some board games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, let’s light a fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, that sounds cozy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. So all we need is to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A scientist made that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, my pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But we have to set some boundaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks for understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You need some help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, Raj, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not the drinking game, a drinking game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To be fair, good at both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve never played that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So I drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it’s only if you’ve done it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m surprised you would do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, he arrested you for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And then you got arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and how.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Are you gonna cry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is it baby hormones or actually sad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t tell anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll go get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And bring back the bear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know the rules. Drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m calling it. I won.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How long have you had this secret account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, how much you got in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What good is it if you don’t use it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hate my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why didn’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If that’s what you want to do, yes.</content></utterance>
