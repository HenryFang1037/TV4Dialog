<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should’ve brought an umbrella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What for? It’s not going to rain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a bazinga, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One of my best, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not my world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t you ask her to come up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She dumped you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hi. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Man in Penny’s Apartment</speaker><content>That makes no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, I want to see this laser thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, but what about the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, menus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Well, mission accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh! That’s very cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The laser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>The moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, now this is a man for Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon! Play nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Preparing to fire laser at the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Make it so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There it is. There’s the spike!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>What species is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was wrong. Penny can do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, just keep walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He must be very skilled at coitus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Horse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s disgusting, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have they found a match for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, we’ll call that plan B.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Coming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn you, you rat bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did I ruin him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, he wasn’t that stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, he’s stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is that my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re gonna have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? I mean, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! Not this again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How many times have I asked you not to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Counting this instance? 317.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where’s Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, last night was a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Mrs Gunderson</speaker><content>Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Holy crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. An actual woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you know what he’s talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope. Why don’t you ask him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard, what are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That was a lousy suggestion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.  I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leslie Winkle</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I know! It’s been a while!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yeah, 18 months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Right. So how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Fine. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>What happened? Blondie dumped you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Let me think about it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s not coming back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not us. Him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, him about to find out about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Us gonna tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s going to tell whom about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your surprise confuses me. I live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be more specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Four thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drink coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, you can have a hot chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s life without whimsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re bluffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you willing to risk it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Curse you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you out of your mind?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t know we’re wrong yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Haughty derision it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I buy you a beverage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Tepid water, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good God, what have we done?</content></utterance>
