<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Can I help you find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Couple of weirdos. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You interested in Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll take one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmm, make it two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate all of you and myself. Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am not washed-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I had half a glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I didn’t have any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Or we play Travel Twister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy, really? Twister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy (reading a text on her phone)</speaker><content>Guys, something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think a boy likes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette (reading)</speaker><content>Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where’s Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Speccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering)</speaker><content>Out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Speccy Guy</speaker><content>I’m Dale. He left me in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Dale</speaker><content>Yeah. I don’t get it, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Dale</speaker><content>Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Dale</speaker><content>I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I guess I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Dale</speaker><content>I’m okay, too!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wild Bill Witchcock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A tribe of Abra-Comanches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Incredibly so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Incredibly so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, fine. Let’s just play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry. Creepy Tepee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Annie Ogly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Totally you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, a sheriff’s badge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s also a wand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re so full of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You unfriended me? Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Who do we love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Who do we love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Who do we love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re not the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I call everyone sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You tramp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>If you’re bored, you can go. I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I’m having a nice time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Don’t patronize me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pardon me. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um, again…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stuart, please. You’re being rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re being impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, you’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon (inside)</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um, good night, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon (inside)</speaker><content>Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How did you get into my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Feel free to retain a lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, I said right hand red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny (picking up wine)</speaker><content>Yeah, I heard you. I got red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette, left foot yellow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Amy.  Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I got a splinter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you want me to do about it?</content></utterance>
