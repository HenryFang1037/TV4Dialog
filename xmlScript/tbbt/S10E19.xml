<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Downward-facing dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought we were getting breakfast before work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, right, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. You’re living here for free, I guess I owe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, bye, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, and tree pose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, she’s done.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s great. How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  I used the  And then I  And that did it.  Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why don’t you ask me what I’m working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, I’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He does raise an interesting point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I’ll wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I understand it, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we’re going for a drive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So did you confront Jennifer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who’s Paul?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Jerry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tina?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I went to your office Christmas party?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is really interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that would make me feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s a ridiculous rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, how is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, this is a moisturizing mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d still like to know who Jerry is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would be great. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You want to go shopping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, yes. Fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, good. What are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, I’ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d write that down, but I can’t now, can I?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, they didn’t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right, Halley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Halley</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fire away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw, someone drew a penis in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you listening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow. Look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, this is remarkable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By the way, your name can go first.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little, until I saw them in matching tops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, have you talked to them about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look, Raj just gets along with women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know where we went wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can hear your face talking, so we’re even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I probably should have spit out my gum first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When did he leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s rude.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait. What? What do I make you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It’s not my fault you didn’t listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sure I’m overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don’t like it, you should just talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is a daring and insightful solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There’s only one clear choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Science it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, you bonehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I’m not the sharpest dresser.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, sweetie, that’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. I just feel…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on, I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, to be truthful…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to speak for Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right. You know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m a good listener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Olsen twins…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What did you want to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, you pretty much covered it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you read them back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I love that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors.</content></utterance>
