<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I must say, Penny, this is great fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Glad you’re enjoying yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You okay in there, bestie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She always this crabby when she urinates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re really not that close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Screw it. I’ll go later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’ll be right by your side.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, what makes me the weakest member?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, no. You have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is good news. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That, that’s brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Elegant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s because it’s simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I’m right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard (outside apartment)</speaker><content>I think he’s getting worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my metatarsal are barking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hadn’t really thought about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure. Very… prominent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hey, you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? In front of your sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>None?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wh… What the hell did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you want to handle it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. 3-D?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s what I hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then the studio must have real faith in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wonder why she didn’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>What other thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s also dating an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Wow. That’s very impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I need a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry, I have company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to hug you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Blue, as in depressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, not so much depressed as lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what colour lonely is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m working on my three-person chess game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, cool. Can I play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, thank you. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yellow. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating. What’s in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s not the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was its own point. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Most of those guys live in Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Obviously, this one doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s a consultant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny (to the shoes)</speaker><content>All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom)</speaker><content>I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>In the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They said something about going there this summer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, are they getting engaged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What astronaut story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t want to do this anymore!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t you quit on us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard (knocking on bathroom door)</speaker><content>Bernie, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Bernadette (screaming)</speaker><content>It was an architect!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, let’s see if this drug works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Woman at table</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Uh, okay, sure. Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What’s he observing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.</content></utterance>
