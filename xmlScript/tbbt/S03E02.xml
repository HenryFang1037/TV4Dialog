<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, first of all…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s more to life than sex, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Disappointed? Let down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, dinner’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tandoori Palace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we went somewhere new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, look, Mumbai Palace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Trust me, this will be just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You are the authority on just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are they talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, I am so embarrassed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please don’t be mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What did you tell them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine? You said it was fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was… okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you’ve been through this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay-dokay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t talk, just drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sounds like a cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t take your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s the matter, you chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Chickens can’t climb trees</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fair enough. What stake do you propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, you have a wager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-65"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>More wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hit me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hallway. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One at a time.  What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shh! Elevator shaft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Help me open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s open her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we drinking now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Peppermint schnapps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Schnapps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj (hearing the cricket)</speaker><content>Stairwell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world.  Are you okay? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What would you name him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I really don’t care anymore</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>God, I had the most horrible night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shiksa. Shik-sa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don’t do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Prof Crawley (arriving)</speaker><content>Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Who wants to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Couldn’t wait, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, could you look at Toby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>It’s a field cricket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Prof Crawley</speaker><content>Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you have a safe deposit box for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would that make me feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, forget the chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I wish I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hardly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have I crossed some sort of line again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Oh, who cares?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that what you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It would take the pressure off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It would, wouldn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, we’ll just be friends.</content></utterance>
