<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you grinding about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just let it go, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They slept together, Sherlock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, how could you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is it to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard and Howard together</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re not in love with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You heard what I did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I heard who you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m nice to everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will. Hey, Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you think I have a shot with Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? Let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can I stay at your place for a few nights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not in the mood, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk to Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Hello, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You called my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on? What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s so nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got any advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Yes. Buck up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I can’t let you do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How did you know I was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s all over her Facebook page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, hi. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall _ Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aw, there’s a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you did, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, we didn’t actually…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I did. It was beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I say I ruined you for white men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Also no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, just the candle thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Cool. All right friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll see you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s getting beautiful again.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT_T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, no and no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.  Geology isn’t a real science! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn those sons of bitches!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s get ’em!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. You guys have a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you going to do in Nebraska?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe teach acting.  Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about Nebraska?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!</content></utterance>
