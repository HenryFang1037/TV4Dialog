<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard (laughs)</speaker><content>I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Penny? Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want the fruit platter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does it have melon on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I can’t eat melon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s one of his best moves.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, my dear, we meet again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Hello, Howard. I’ve missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>One question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, if you insist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, have you seen my girdle?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I can’t find it, and I’m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette? What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Well, if I had to guess, I’d say I’m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you’re still hung up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m a little confused here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>George Takei</speaker><content>Oh, my. Can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not that kind of confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s George Takei doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>George Takei</speaker><content>So you say. Yet, here I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>George Takei</speaker><content>It’s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O’Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Katee Sackhoff</speaker><content>Tell me about it. It’s frackin’ frustrating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I did a stupid thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I guessed that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Stop asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In a nutshell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have a desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I can’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re two for two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, what if he buys his own desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I can put it in your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They do some of their best work at night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny (picking up a top and sniffing it)</speaker><content>Ah, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon (voice)</speaker><content> Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She saw that, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I’d rather not say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But it’s embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, the online game? Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Would you talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bernadette or the troll?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what was your side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I will think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I said I’d think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why on earth are you telling me all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You said I could buy a desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s actually British.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can you say it again for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brobdingnagian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One more time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brobdingnagian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now three times fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Knock yourself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Help me move my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stand by for my upcoming tat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. See what I did there? I turned it around.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry, I had to clock out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not for me, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you gonna want to order food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, are you seeing anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Penny, can we have a little privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about you, have you been seeing anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you’ve been seeing other girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, not real girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Does that mean slutty trolls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s passion fruit, new on the menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know. I work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not where I can hear you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Had sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, whose fault was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean, whose fault was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.</content></utterance>
