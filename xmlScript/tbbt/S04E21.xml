<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, are you in the shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What kind of emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You might not want to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I assure you I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We were in here first, you can’t be in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny?  Penny?  Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Move. Move. Move!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Proceed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Can I see the roommate agreement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, it’s fairly technical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I think I can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do so, do so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Schooled!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Superceded!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This isn’t over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)</speaker><content>I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d like to refer that to my attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Opa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not as much as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got you the lamb kabob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny?  Penny?  Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shotgun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I need some context.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pantsuits suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Whee-ee-ee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You smell like baby powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know how to process that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s too many S’s for kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not if they’re doing it for a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m available for experimentation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you take dance lessons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we are so taking you dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you most certainly are not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Take us to a place we can waltz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Taxi driver</speaker><content>Where you can what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Taxi Driver</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Amy (singing)</speaker><content>I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened to you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shake it baby, shake it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Muy caliente, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Elderly Korean Gentleman</speaker><content>Care to dance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Korean</speaker><content>How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what the hell. Ooh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s 16 times 14?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My burps taste like cranberry juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And there’s your answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Would you like to come in for a nightcap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have yoo-hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Make yourself comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Is someone smoking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, that’s just Ricky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You own a smoking monkey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s he doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you want me to kill her? Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you suggesting I play dirty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Sheldon (to Ricky)</speaker><content>Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would I want to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Female Voice</speaker><content>Self-destruct sequence activated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>So what happens when it counts down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Trust me, it’s a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yeah, of course, just not today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>20 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you ashamed of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then why can’t we tell your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Please, don’t push this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he’s bluffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never bluff. Ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s blackmail!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>We give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Give him what he wants or we’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll sign it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>Female Voice</speaker><content>Self-destruct sequence aborted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It most assuredly is not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes. I also found a Korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor.
