<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How many is that now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, who’s watching her now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A bowl full of M_M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What up, guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hello, hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, hey, what the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys propose all the time. This never happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right! Yay!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because you had sex the other night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. I am really aggravated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, give her a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>No. Life, it is too short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s not helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, what if we use our vacation time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know what else we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam)</speaker><content>Hello, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>Would you like for you and me to talk more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? It’s probably fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, it would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Mrs Hofstadter</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, you should work on that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny (on phone)</speaker><content>No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Atomic magnets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want some wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please. I’m desperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll pay you anything you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, then, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, keep your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s nice that you called them esteemed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. I’ll take that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, well, we might want to live together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are you going to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They just don’t appreciate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. Perhaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, it was just a thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It tastes the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is so sweet. You never cook for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry. I’ll get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. And when would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, is Sheldon here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I thought he was with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He was really angry that you suggested he move out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you couldn’t put it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So when will you reopen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, sorry I let you down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’ll be $2.99.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? It’s soaking wet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Fine, a dollar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you break a twenty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, I only have hundreds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content> That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna see where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s at the train station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So? He loves trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You slept with her? Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So what’s the catch?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You tracked my phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We were worried about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And go where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what can I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It might be good for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s a grown man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously, let him go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Be safe and call us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye, buddy. Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m gonna miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He just made that easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Was that a little weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go.</content></utterance>
