<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, will you steam my uniform next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, then why are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hang on a second.  Hold this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What was that for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To show people when they don’t believe me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s not exhausting at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny (receiving text)</speaker><content>Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When did Howard learn to sew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The comic book store isn’t far from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you should turn on the GPS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Has it really only been ten miles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>GPS (in Sheldon’s voice)</speaker><content>Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That is so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Counterpoint, no, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>GPS</speaker><content>Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here’s an interesting fact about interstates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shh, he said it’s interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>GPS</speaker><content>Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>GPS</speaker><content>Recalculating. While we’re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why are they staring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They’re just girls. It’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What brings you guys here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, well, I recommend you don’t open a store and sell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What kind of comics do the guys like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, well, who’s the best superhero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Shh! You can’t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well then, what do you recommend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, uh, let’s see. You’ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, I do love a bad boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>If I were you, I’d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it’s intelligently written, and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, he kind of is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard (dressed as a Borg)</speaker><content>Come on, guys. Let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard (dressed as Captain Picard)</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what’s our first pose going to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll set the timer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, what’s next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Hey, hey! Come back here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stealing is against the law!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, so is mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. Nice going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I have street smarts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, what’d you guys think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, there was a lot of action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That makes even less sense, I mean…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, which is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe we missed something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s read it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You want some tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good idea. I’ll help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, I thought we were reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Guys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon)</speaker><content>Nerds!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hate this planet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You said it’s a magic hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Waitress</speaker><content>Why don’t you ask Scotty to beam you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re not with him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Was there anything valuable in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Our clothes, our wallets, phones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Makeup? Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>I don’t know, sounds pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, he gets how cool it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I’m guessing your moms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m with Leonard. I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, it’s three against one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did that ever happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy (off)</speaker><content>Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Amy(off)</speaker><content>The strap is part of the hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>No, it’s not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are they actually arguing about comic books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Then Red Hulk must be worthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>How could Red Hulk be worthy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>You don’t know his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Captain, what are your orders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I say we investigate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. They might be hostile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>GPS</speaker><content>Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>First Car Thief</speaker><content>Wow, that is interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Second Car Thief</speaker><content>You learn something new every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>GPS</speaker><content>Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>First Car Thief</speaker><content>Ooh, another quiz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Second Car Thief</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
