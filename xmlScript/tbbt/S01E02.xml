<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But does it have peanut oil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are there any chopsticks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Am I interrupting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>You’re not swelling, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna sausages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sounds like you have company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re not going anywhere.  So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so….  Oh! Hel…hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I haven’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get used to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together</speaker><content>One. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, I know, men can’t fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m just going to go wash up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Challenge accepted.  We’re locked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-57"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also, the pretty girl left.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hardly think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter…  I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Archimedes would be so proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you have any ideas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Easy, easy  Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard (snarkily)</speaker><content>Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s your formula for the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Men do things for women without expecting sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, those are men who just had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Almost there, almost there, almost there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it hurt…  Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So Penny’s a little messy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, we should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Straightening up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is not your home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What were you doing in his closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I helped run some cable for a webcam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’ll get out of your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great, thank you again .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, he didn’t tell it right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon? Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just gave you a reasonable explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we have to get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You might want to speak in a lower register.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No,  that’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard (doing likewise)</speaker><content>Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am not leaving until I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>O-o-o-oh! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, what the hell.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t think that crosses a line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have a sarcasm sign?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny (voice off)</speaker><content>Son of a Bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny (voice off)</speaker><content>You sick, geeky bastards!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did she know it was us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny (voice off)</speaker><content>Leonard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>God, this is going to be bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but, only to clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Give me back my key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m very, very sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you understand how creepy this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In my apartment, while I was sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Stay away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, that’s another way to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What’s funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That wasn’t sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)</speaker><content>Ooh, she’s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj (internally)</speaker><content>She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj (internally)</speaker><content>She asked me a question. I should probably nod. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj (internally)</speaker><content>Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard (jumping off game mat)</speaker><content>Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s fine. You win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s his problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Been there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj (entering)</speaker><content>Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did she say? Is she still mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>intoxicating, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, here’s the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny (hugs him)</speaker><content>We’re okay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Six two inch dowels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One package, Phillips head screws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Considering what? How great this place looks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard (across room with Raj)</speaker><content>Oh boy, I was afraid of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We could put her stereo back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And control it how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)</speaker><content>Good point, how you gonna cool it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey guys, I got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Also inefficient, and might be loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, this is actually really simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Meet back here in an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, this place does look pretty good.</content></utterance>
