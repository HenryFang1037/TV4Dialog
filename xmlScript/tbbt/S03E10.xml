<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, she’s doing it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want me to put it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. The more, the merrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>NO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s where Sheldon sits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He can’t sit somewhere else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, I love your shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where’d you get them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shoes for Less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve been meaning to go over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great selection, great prices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mother was right. Hell is real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Womenfolk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just eat your dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, never let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am. Are you interested in physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bazinga. I don’t care.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just need a little more practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not about shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, actually, can we do it in private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.  Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why can’t Leonard teach you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause I want to surprise him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re sitting here playing video games all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure. I did the one with the frogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The one with the frogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who are all those people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, how’s your experiment going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Boy, I’d love to see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like Hanukkah in July.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do they have that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah? So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Has it ever worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not so far, but that’s not the point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I believe you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ready to get started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I don’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How are you going to take notes without a notebook?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have to take notes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How else are you gonna study for the tests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There’s gonna be a test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ancient Greece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Twenty six hundred years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can’t you hold it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not for twenty six hundred years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It unhooks in the front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that explains a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Howard, I’m home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s great, Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess I should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please? I got a real hankering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face. I’ll be back soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks, Ma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right! What if they’re out of the Le Seur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then get the regular!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>All right! You don’t have to yell!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Bernadette (her phone chimes)</speaker><content>Let me just put that on vibrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m already on vibrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, what do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? He said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you just suck at teaching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not that far back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Greece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Squared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aristotle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I’m stupid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A good question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, balls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did I do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was I supposed to tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And what would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, do I have to think of everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You told her my experiment was stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should I, um, leave you two alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, Leonard, you should hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re shocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But I now realize how foolish that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come here, tushy face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.</content></utterance>
