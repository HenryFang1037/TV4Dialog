<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny (who is inside the apartment)</speaker><content>Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t panic, this is better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s Adam West?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is so sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And an Aquaman action figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Looks like someone drew a penis on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh? That’ll come off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You see what you’re doing? Stop that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One Ring to find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One Ring to bring them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And in the darkness bind them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Holy crap, are we nerdy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, I was doing some checking on the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seedy underbelly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just a guy. I know a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is it Eddie Crispo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know lots of dangerous people, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Name one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon (snatching it)</speaker><content>Mine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is this maritime salvage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Other than the lack of water, how is it not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Your guy Eddie Crispo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do you want a jet ski?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s sad how great that sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are no Jewish hobbits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean my ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You always get your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Looking for something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How am I looking now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s my girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Man on Screen</speaker><content>Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also my cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You brought a lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Venkatesh</speaker><content>Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No Jet Skis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Venkatesh</speaker><content>All right, forget the Jet Skis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Venkatesh</speaker><content>What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re useless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Venkatesh</speaker><content>I told you that when you hired me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m signing off now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Venkatesh</speaker><content>Call your mother, she worries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s all of ours. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, now, this is ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then let go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not letting go, you let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure. Let go of the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, it starts now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, my laptop. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are six seasons, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, crap!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Door. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whatcha doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Will you be quiet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t we go after your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No! I call no Meemaws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then let go of the ring and walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re getting to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Waterfalls!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s, it’s not working, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then let go of the ring and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We stand up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine!  We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious.  Where’s the ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The fires of Mount Doom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You quit the game! You had no right to take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!
