<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You can’t just throw everything in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What if someone looks in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, guys, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, it smells good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you shouldn’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s my pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You stopped and got him takeout?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now don’t you feel silly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Show him the closet.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Colour’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, five more minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How come I never get to do anything I want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Juggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You health nuts kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa, you opened this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks. Oh. Great party.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Trying to paint a picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Although…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s this stupid letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you read it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You must be curious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something I should have done a long time ago. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do.  Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe he set it on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bermadette</speaker><content>That works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have something we want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we just want information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What did it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, all I did was invite you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, where have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, then that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>As is the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, try doing it in heels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know what was in your dad’s letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I made him tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Us? Who else knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Same here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Shame on all of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How could you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you want, we could tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Use me as a human shield!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I panicked. He looked taller than usual.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Think you could take a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Got a little surprise for you. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sit down, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, which one do you think it is, matey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, one of them is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-46"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-48"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-50"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t you dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-52"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s more like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Glad you’re feeling better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This turned out pretty well, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Party’s over! Party’s over!</content></utterance>
