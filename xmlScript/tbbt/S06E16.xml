<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that was the point of the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I think so. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You could be a little more into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you caught that, did you?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>There must be something we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you coming to lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t find a card that says that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Want to come to dinner with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>No, I just thought it would be…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Okay. Um, I know she’s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>So I found this cool map that illustrates the character’s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>I don’t know how to respond to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I’ll keep it for myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Alex</speaker><content>What about your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s too late. I call dibs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This place is really beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Waugh, romance ninja.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry we’re late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No problem. We just sat down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, would you like some wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Terrific. Couldn’t be better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, bite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, where what is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I said I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I told you, turn them inside out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And I told you to bite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Trying to have a magical night here, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, son of a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just this guy I used to date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s the spirit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?  Oh, you got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Gretchen</speaker><content>Oh, my God, yes. Of course I’ll marry you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Two can play this game. Penny…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. In fact, there’s no place I would rather be than here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Except on a date with anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Literally anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That does sound nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They do look happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought we were letting it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not. It’s about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This one does, and you’re the reason why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So where’d you hide it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where you’d never look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn it, it’s in the washing machine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Happy Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Shall we go to dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>More than anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you picked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not saying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Obviously, I have some commitment issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Glaringly obvious. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard Hofstadter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Will you be my valentine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Nerdy guy</speaker><content>Thank you, guys, for doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re glad you could make it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight’s the night I know everyone else does, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Nerdy guy</speaker><content>I think you’re cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>That was cool. What you said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.</content></utterance>
