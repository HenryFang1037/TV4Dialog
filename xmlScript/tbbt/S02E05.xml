<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then you can drive. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Goodnight, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But how am I going to get to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Take the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny,  Penny,  Penny…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>Sheldon, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard’s asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks for the update </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, wait. You have to drive me to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, dear God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for driving me to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know this is my day off, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, maybe the light’s broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is there a “check the check engine light light”?  O-o-o-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you have any alcohol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re going up Euclid Avenue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good for Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about we just have a little quiet time now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny (Pulling over)</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I said, get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll give it a shot. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just got here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, perfect timing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, help me out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, how do you propose I get home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did you get here in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We had a difference of opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Over what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m taking you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have a better idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want to go to pottery barn first?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?  Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This madness has to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, come on Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on, I have one condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We have to stop at Pottery Barn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And Radio Shack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I like comic books.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was otherwise engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, how ’bout when you were 17?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>DMV Lady (to the person ahead of Sheldon in the queue)</speaker><content>Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!  Application?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m actually more of a theorist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The application in your hand, give it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Look at that sign up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Does it say I give a damn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>That’s because I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Look at the sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t need your help, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Don’t make me climb over this counter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>DMV Lady</speaker><content>Next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aced it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Booting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon (sucking in breath)</speaker><content>Hmmmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, what colour do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Black it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fasten your seat belt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Click. Now, are there air bags?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t need air bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if a simulated van rear-ends me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Watch out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I quit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, the pet store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So wait,you’re just gonna give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what is it you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s never safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I know that now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Homo Novus doesn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
