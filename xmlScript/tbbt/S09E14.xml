<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That someone has a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I park fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Same as when we lost you at the zoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Moon Pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>I’m so happy to see you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Is that nice to say to your friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you please live with us forever?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Which is probably why that movie sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you comfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How was your trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I have a tissue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I did, would I find any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a risk I’m willing to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>S, s, si, size me up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Oh, you better hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I’ll take your word for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should. He’s really looked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Claire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re a screenwriter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>You’re really a scientist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, astrophysicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure. I love animated movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He does, and he has the Lilo _ Stitch collector plates to prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Thank you, Moon Pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard and Penny</speaker><content>She could just eat him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, now I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>That doesn’t bode well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>I appreciate your honesty, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, maybe I don’t like you either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I should leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we should give them some privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have an engagement ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, did you know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When did you get an engagement ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Well, thank goodness for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think I could do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just to help her with her screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You weren’t there. He was really flirting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? So it’s okay if I fl…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. I had reservations about you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re right. It could totally happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Claire (voice)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Okay. Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Sure, we had a vibe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You still have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Great. I’ll text you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you gonna tell Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When are you gonna tell Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>I know more than you think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just get in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He never disappoints, does he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Say yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Meemaw</speaker><content>I suppose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
