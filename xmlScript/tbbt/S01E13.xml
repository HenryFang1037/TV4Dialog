<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There’s going to be a scene depicting Spock’s birth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it’s an extremely private matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it’s just going “aaaaaaa”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did you spill on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll take a look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Recognise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Zod?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Kryptonian villain. Long story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good story. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well count me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I want tickets to that please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The needs of the many.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Outweigh the needs of the few.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about the perpetual motion squad? It’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The ladies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I will yield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fire away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I knew that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I buzzed in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I answered, it’s called teamwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just ask another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because it’s polite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Some of us might have the correct answers too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Alright, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>maybe we should take a little break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)</speaker><content>I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and the bag it came in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can it wait, I need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do they say AA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Army Ants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh neat, what’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes we did, I just came from it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for the heads up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. One more thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s on, bitch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So who’d he get to be on his team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How exactly would that laugh go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So nothing, let’s destroy him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon (walking past)</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about the girl from the Wonder Years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Sack up, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hit that thang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Leonard, there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we’ve seen each other’s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Proceed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No thanks, I’m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Wait, you’re going up against Sheldon Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon (entering in his Star Trek themed shirt)</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, is that your team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leslie Winkle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Dr Gablehouser</speaker><content>Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s your tee-shirt. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>PMS? It’s a couple of days early, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year’s physics bowl. Today’s preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All night long, y’all! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Okay, well let’s jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson?  PMS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The Eta Meson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Formal protest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>On what grounds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope.  AA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And of course, the answer is Technetium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation.  PMS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>How does a quantum computer factor large numbers.  PMS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Shor’s Algorithm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Prevost’s theory of exchanges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A sigma particle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Holy crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, think, Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Leonard, it’s not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re never going to let that go, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Ten seconds.  PMS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, I panicked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then guess.</content></utterance>
