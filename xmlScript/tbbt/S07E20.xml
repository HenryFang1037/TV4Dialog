<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Only without the sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, literally, none of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you think about it, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you’re jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I be jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you’re up early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I couldn’t sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that’s not it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is something bothering you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean your acting career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your relationship with Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your failed attempt to go back to college?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said Leonard, you said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m talking about other guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Well, what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know if I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Break it off, shake hands, walk away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how’s dating two women going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She is. But I like that attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re really going to do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re reading Cosmo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s going to be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, you and Emily still together?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s very real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No jokes about the year I took ballet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You took ballet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>God, you never listen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure you want to do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll)</speaker><content>Oh my God, I do look like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how do you want me to cut it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, business in the front, science in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It actually looks good, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late. What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s right. I’m too hot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m excited to meet Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In a bad way, very bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Have we met before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You sure? You look familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That must be it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Since when do you go to spin class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. What’s wrong with geology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you considered studying standard model physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Like you could get a brown bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about loop quantum gravity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s the duchess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One of the people that lives in his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How does that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Emily, what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I finish my astronaut story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>It was four years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please don’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>We were set up on a blind date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please don’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You came to my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re saying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wh, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please don’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Right, just water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No more than Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s what I’m saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room.  Empty room.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, we moved on a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m just saying…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We moved on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How’s your soup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I need some fresh air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Been there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>After she put you to bed, she went home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
