<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The little choo-choo for toddlers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And now you know why I needed the massage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay, you should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me? How? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess we could give it a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I bet you’d like a drink right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. I’d like to meet her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, but I won’t be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Funny how that worked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m still dating her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who’s Frank and Alicia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am going to record this for posterity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, here goes nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s, it’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, it’s making me dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good, it’s not just me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Claire (on phone)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Claire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why would it be too big a step?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You actually smell the wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mostly just smell my nasal spray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are your sinuses acting up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Since my preschool got a bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re leaving now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy, do I love restrictions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. Where is everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, we’re the first ones here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah. Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I do. It was three years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. What are they gonna talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. I really don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys been here long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where’s Claire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you gonna say hi to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I brought sparkling cider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So what do you want to do tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s more than one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ve heard of French toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cinnamon toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Melba toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You get where I’m going here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m getting an earthy note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, there’s definitely some oak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Also, uh, cherries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I smell nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just a whole lot of Afrin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, hey, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, did you two get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>To each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But we won’t bore you with the details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Mike deGrasse Tyson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>So what’s your invention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Is it better than the one they use now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Way better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Huh. You sure you guys are smart?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What is it about trains that you like so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s lovely, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why didn’t you say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hey, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would you like a glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I said no questions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons _ Dragons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Dungeons _ Dragons? That sounds about right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, but just for a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. I like the idea of being tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is getting fun. What’s next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He wants to see I.D.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Really? Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Zack, this is my friend Claire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You’re hot. You seeing anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, she’s seeing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Why’d you say she’s your friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re just keeping it casual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>I don’t know. Ask him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got something better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Does it have eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I stab it in the middle eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, thanks again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I might just take you up on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Anything for you, my little foreign friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. He still has an AOL address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Polo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, uh, what are you guys talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ugh. Too much wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does it bother you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who are these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.</content></utterance>
