<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Eh, his giant head did most of the work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding. He’s still alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s Professor Proton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He was the host of this great… Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hire him to do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you remember his old theme song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you put her in a kennel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t you put your mother in a home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’d you get him to come to your house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And he wrote him a cheque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Classy dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howatd</speaker><content>I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Leonard, are you in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>I can’t sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I can, so shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not ridiculous. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Do you have cufflinks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>I still can’t sleep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Where’d she go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I wasn’t. You were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, you were!.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m getting worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress.  It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Just, just call me Arthur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Is, uh, is he dangerous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, he’s a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>That doesn’t answer my question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You’re the genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No, no. I, I hate that puppet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Cinnamon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cinnamon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette (likewise)</speaker><content>Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It turns you on when I sound like Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cinnamon!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I didn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, I’m not a scientist like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I, I figured that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Potato clock. Do potato clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>What do you two talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No, I, I get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s important you know how much you mean to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Arthur, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll, I’ll call for help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Any chance we could plug it into the potato?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content>Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Paramedic</speaker><content>No, that’s not a rule. He can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I can’t catch a break today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry things turned out this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs.  It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You have her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thank God she’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I, I thought about…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. I, I just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.</content></utterance>
