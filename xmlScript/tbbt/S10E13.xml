<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that is so thoughtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>and this wine is why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Hey, what smells so good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You did not just quote an Nsync song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I quoted your favourite Nsync song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you gonna laugh at the answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hadn’t really thought about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh oh, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, got Halley to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Have you tried anything to fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did that do anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. Good game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anything to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Some wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just ignore him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hm. At least he took an interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hey, come on, just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Where is this coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That sounds expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, we’re heading out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go ahead, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll miss you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll miss you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And it’s just the way you like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Earl grey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Honey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unsweetened almond…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what can we do to cheer you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like to play a driving game I invented?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>When was the last time you got a massage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I came here to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nice to see you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that’s how you make effort look effortless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t understand what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m trying to figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bigger problems, I felt something pop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s a cucumber in my water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re not getting divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Penny (after Amy laughs)</speaker><content>Do you really think that’s funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does it really need to say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did this for free, let me get a little something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think this all looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I remember signing our first relationship agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Right, right. Got it.</content></utterance>
